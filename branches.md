# About this file

This file, branches.md, describes the recommended way for Leo's devs to create and use git branches.<br>
It also describes Leo's most important branches. 

Many thanks to Marcel Franke for suggesting the organization described here.

Devs, please add/delete a branch description here when creating/deleting a branch. <br>
*Commit the change to the devel branch*.

# Overview of branches

Devs may create a branch at any time.  The most important branches:

- **master**: a permanent, stable branch,  suitable for even the most timid users.
- **devel**: a permanent, quasi-stable branch. Everthing new comes from devel and goes to devel.
- **Feature branches**:  Unstable. Devs are expected to run all unit tests before pushing to devel.
- **Release branches**: These contain all work on a single, specific release.  Example, 5.7.1.
  These branches should contain *only*:
  - All distribution-related work.
  - Urgent last-minute bug fixes.<br>
