[Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) 5.1 final is now available [at SourceForge.](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/) Leo is a PIM, an IDE and an outliner.

Leo 5.1-final is recommended for anyone using Leo 5.1 b1 or Leo 5.0-final.

**The highlights of Leo 5.1**

This release features **@clean** trees, one of the most important developments in Leo's history.

@clean nodes create external files without sentinel comments, yet Leo can update @clean trees from changes made to the corresponding external files, something long thought impossible. @clean trees preserve clone links and user attributes (uA's). Reading @clean trees is faster than reading @auto or @shadow trees. Steve Zatz [explains why @clean changes everything.](http://leoeditor.com/testimonials.html#steve-zatz-explains-why-clean-changes-everything)

**More highlights**
 
* A new [web page](http://leoeditor.com/load-leo.html) displays .leo files in the browser.
  
* Added **command history** to Leo's minibuffer.

* A new IdleTime class greatly simplifies idle-time handling.

* Leo now honors @language inside @doc parts

* @data nodes can be composed of their descendant nodes.

* @shadow is now deprecated. @clean is superior to @shadow in all respects.

The [Mulder/Ream algorithm](http://leoeditor.com/appendices.html#the-mulder-ream-update-algorithm) updates @clean trees from changes made in the corresponding external files.
