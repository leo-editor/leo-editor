    "Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy."---Joe Orr

Leo is a fundamentally different way of using and organizing data, programs and scripts. Leo has been under active development for 20+ years with an active `group of developers and users`_.

**Leo is:**

- A fully-featured IDE, with many features inspired by `Emacs`_.
- An outliner. Everything in Leo is an outline.
- A data manager, data manager and personal information manager.
- A powerful scripting environment.
- A tool for organizing and studying computer code.
- Extensible via a simple plugin architecture.
- A tool that plays well with  IPython, Vim and Emacs.
- Written in 100% pure Python

**Leo's unique features**

Leo *completely integrates* Python scripting and outlines. Simulating the following features in Vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible, just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...

- All commands and scripts have easy access to outline structure via a simple `Python API`_. |br|
  For example, p.b is the body text of the selected outline node. |br|
  Scripts have full access to all of Leo's sources.
- `Clones`_ create multiple views of an outline.  |br|
  Leo's underlying data is a `Directed Acyclic Graphs`_.  |br|
  As a result, Leo organizes data in completely new ways.
- Leo's `clone find commands`_ enable the `Leonine way to refactor programs`_.
- Scripts and programs can be composed from outlines using `outline-oriented directives`_.
- Importers convert flat text into outlines.
- @button scripts apply scripts to outline data.

These features combine to create a `Leonine`_ way of programming and
organizing. You won't learn all about Leo in a day or two. `Leo's
tutorial`_ explains the basic features. You can learn more advanced
features later. Please `ask for help`_ immediately if you get stuck.
