Using Leo's native vim mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In general, vim-mode in Leo works much as in the real vim. There are three modes, insert, normal and visual.

Supported commands
******************

- Cursor motions: ^,$,0,b,e,f,F,gg,gG,j,h,k,l,t,T,w.
- The gb,ge,gh commands are synonyms for 0,$,^.
- The h,j,k,l commands work on outlines when entered in the outline pane.
- 0 in outline pane: goto-first-visible-node
- e in outline pane: goto-last-visible-node.
- Deleting text: d{motion},{motion}d,v{motion}d,diw,x.
- Insert commands: a,A,i,o,O and switch to insert mode if entered in the outline pane.
- Yank & paste commands: y,p. These act on outlines if entered in the outline pane.
- Search commands: /,?,n,*,#.  These commands are node-only searches.
- The dot command '.' works for motions, but not yet for inserts or searches.
- v: start/end visual mode.

Notes:

- Except as noted above, all vim-mode commands must be entered in the body pane.
- <Return> in headlines switches to the outline pane.
- <Return> in the outline pane switches to the body pane.

Differences from the real vim
*****************************

- The gb,ge,gh commands are synonyms for 0,$,^.
- The h,j,k,l commands work on outlines when entered in the outline pane.
- The a,A,i,o,O commands switch to insert mode if entered in the outline pane.
- The y,p commands act on outlines if entered in the outline pane.
- Ending visual mode with 'v' retains the selection range.
- Ctrl-H puts the headline in insert mode.
- Mouse clicks never change vim's state.

Abbreviations
*************

- The ``jj`` abbreviation switches to normal mode, preserving the changed
  status of the .leo file.
- Return in visual/normal mode enters insert mode.

..  - ``,,`` in normal mode now moves to insert mode.
..  ``,,`` in insert mode does nothing, unless there is an abbreviation template available.

Colon commands
**************

The ':' command enters Leo's minibuffer, with ':' pre-inserted. You may
backspace over the ':'. Here are the commands::
  
    :! Execute a shell command.
    :e! Revert all changes to a .leo file, prompting if there have been changes.
    :gt cycle-focus
    :q Quit, prompting for saves.
    :qa Quit only if there are no unsaved changes.
    :r Prompt for a file name.  Insert it at the cursor.
    :tabnew Prompt for a file name, and open a new tab.
    :w Save the .leo file.
    :wa Save all changed  .leo files.
    :wq Save all open files and exit.
    :xa ave all open files and exit.
    
The following colon commands are unique to Leo::

    :print-vim-dot
    :toggle-vim-mode
    :toggle-vim-trainer-mode

Settings
********

**@bool vim-mode = False**: Enables Leo's vim mode when True.

**@bool vim-crosses-lines = True**: When True the f,F,h,l,t,T,x
commands may cross line boundaries.

Using vimoutline (.otl) files in Leo
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Leo can automatically import and export vimoutline (.otl) files. Nodes like::

    @auto-otl <path to .otl file>

or equivalently::

    @auto-vimoutline <path to .otl file>
    
import the .otl as a Leo outline.

These nodes work like other @auto nodes: when Leo loads an outline, Leo reads the .otl file into the @auto-otl tree. When Leo writes an outline, Leo writes any @auto-otl tree back to the .otl file.

After creating an @auto-otl node by hand, be sure to use Leo's refresh-from-disk command to populate the node. Do this *before* saving the .leo file. If you try to save an empty @auto-otl node Leo will warn you that you are about to overwrite the file.

The refresh-from-disk command creates an @auto-otl node whose **children** represent the contents of the external .otl file. Leo does *not* write the @auto-otl node itself. This allows you to put Leo directives in the node.

Using stand-alone vim bindings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Installing vim bindings
***********************

Place a copy of the "@keys Vim bindings" node and its sub-nodes, located in the leoSettings.leo file, under the "@settings" node in the myLeoSettings.leo file

The same procedure is performed to update to a new version.

Note: Place any local customized key bindings in a separate "@keys My Vi" node in the myLeoSettings.leo file to prevent them from being overwritten when updating to a new version.

General commands
****************

The following commands are always available.

State change commands::

    i           Change state to insert from command state
    Esc         Change state to command from insert state
    Ctrl-[      Same as ESC

Save/Exit/Quite commands::

    :e          Revert
    :w<return>  Save '.leo' file
    :wq<return> Save '.leo' file and quit Leo
    :q<return>  Quit Leo   (Leo will prompt if file not saved)
    ZZ          Save leo file and exit

Undo/Redo commands::

    u           Undo previous command
    Ctrl-r      Redo previous command


Search options::

    Ctrl-/      Prompt for option to change
                Options:
                    a   Search all nodes (also <cr> key)
                    h   Toggle headline search
                    b   Toggle body search
                    m   Toggle marking of nodes (specify sub-option)
                        f   Toggle marking of nodes with found text

                        ('/' key turns off regex. 'n' key uses regex if turned on)

    Note: Whether a search is limited to node's body or the node's sub-outline
          is determined by which pane has focus when search text specified.
          (See "Find text commands:" sub-sections in Outline/Body Pane sections)

Avoiding changes to 'tag' files
*******************************

If you use the open-with command to open a node text in Vim and your Vim's "tag" file refers to external files then there is a risk that a external file that is initially displayed via the "tag" command" in Vim is accidentally edited and saved from the external Vim editor while your Leo session still contains the external file's original text that may later recreate the original external file during a Leo save operation (overwriting the changes saved from the Vim editor).

To prevent this problem, modifications to external files can be avoided by using Vim's "modeline" feature to disable editing of external files.

Vim's "modeline" feature scans each loaded buffer for text at the top or bottom of the file containing " vim:" followed by a series of Vim options. The text is usually embedded within a comment. The following example prevents modifications to a buffer in a Python file::

    # vim:noma (A space is required between the '#' and "vim:noma")

If this line is placed in a separate Leo node at the top or bottom of the list of nodes under a external file node (ex: @file) then any external file saved and then later loaded into Vim will, by default, not be modifiable. If a derived file does need to be edited then modifications can be re-enabled on a file-by-file basis by issuing Vim's ":ma" command while viewing the derived file.

The number of lines that Vim checks at the top and bottom of the buffer is configurable. The following Vim command must be placed in the vimrc file to allow for Leo's trailing sentinel lines::

    set modelines=8

Issue the ":help modeline" command within Vim for the more information about modelines.
