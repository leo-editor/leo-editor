Leo's Commands Reference
########################

This chapter lists almost all of Leo's commands. It starts with a discussion of the Emacs-like minibuffer.

Executing commands from the minibuffer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Leo’s minibuffer appears at the bottom of Leo’s main window. You use the minibuffer to execute commands by name, and also to accumulate arguments to commands.

Every Leo command has a **command name**. In this document, keystrokes that invoke a command will be followed by the command name in parentheses. For example, ``Ctrl-S (save-file)`` saves a Leo file.

**Very Important**: Leo has hundreds of commands, but because of tab completion you do not have to remember, or even *know about* any of them.  Feel free to ignore commands that you don't use. The following prefixes help find commands by name:: 

    clone-find  clone-find commands
    file-       file commands
    find-       find commands
    isearch-    incremental search commands
    leo-        open .leo files
    open-       open files or url's
    print-      print commands
    rectangle-  rectangle commands
    sort-       sort commands
    toggle-     toggle settings commands
    
Here are the commands that pertain to executing commands:

``Alt-X (full-command)``
    Executes any other command by typing its full name.
    
``Ctrl-P (repeat-complex-command``
    Repeats the last command entered by name in the minibuffer.
    
When in the minibuffer, the following keys are treated in special ways:

``<Return>``
    Executes the command.

``<Tab>``
    Shows all valid completions.

``<BackSpace>``
    Shows more completions.
    
``Ctrl-G``
    Exits the minibuffer and puts focus in the body pane.
    
``UpArrow``
    Moves backward through command history. The first ``UpArrow`` is the same as ``Ctrl-P``.

``DownArrow``
    Moves forward through command history.

Typing completion
*****************

**Very Important**: Leo has hundreds of commands, but because of tab completion you do not have to remember, or even *know about* any of them.  Feel free to ignore commands that you don't use.

You could type the full command name in the minibuffer, followed by the ``<Return>`` key to invoke the command, but that would be *way* too much work. Instead, you can avoid most typing using **tab completion**. With tab completion, *there is no need to remember the exact names of Leo’s commands*.

For example, suppose you want to print out the list of Leo’s commands. You might remember only that there are several related commands and that they all start with "print". Just type ``<Alt-X>pri<Tab>``

You will see ``print-`` in the minibuffer. This is the longest common prefix of all the command names that start with ``pri``. The Completion tab in the log pane shows all the commands that start with ``print-``.

Now just type ``c<Tab>`` You will see the ``print-commands`` command in the minibuffer.

Finally, ``<Return>`` executes the ``print-commands`` command. The output of the print-commands command appears in the commands tab, and focus returns to the body pane.

Filename completion
*******************

``file-open-by-name``
    Prompts for a filename. This command completes the name of files and directories as in command completion.  As a result, this command can be very fast.  You may want to bind this command to ``Ctrl-O`` instead of the default ``open-outline`` command.

Most important commands
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. New. In commands reference.

File operations & sessions
**************************

Here are Leo's basic file commands:

``Ctrl-N (new)``
    Creates a new outline in a new tab.
``Ctrl-O (open-outline)``
    Opens an existing .leo file.
``Ctrl-S (save-file)``
    Saves the outline.
``Ctrl-Q (exit-leo)``
    Exits Leo.  Leo will prompt you to save any unsaved outlines.
    
A **session** specifies a list of .leo files that Leo opens automatically when Leo first starts.  Leo will reload the last session provided that command-line arguments *don't* contain any file names.

Switching focus
***************

Here's how to switch focus without using the mouse:

``Alt-0 (vr-toggle)``
    Hides or shows the viewrendered pane.
``Alt-T (focus-to-tree)``
    Puts focus in the outline pane, regardless of focus.
``Ctrl-T (toggle-active-pane)``
    Toggles focus between the outline and body panes.
``Ctrl-Tab (tab-cycle-next)``
    Switches between outline tabs. You may open multiple Leo outlines in different tabs within the same main window.
``Ctrl-G (keyboard-quit)``
    Puts focus in the body pane. More effective than hitting Alt-Tab twice.

Outline commands
****************

``Ctrl-I or Insert (insert-node)``
    Inserts a new node into the outline.
``Ctrl-H (edit-headline)``
    Begins editing the headline of the selected node.
``Return``
    When focus is in the outline pane, ``<Return>`` ends editing ``(end-edit-headline)`` or switches focus to the body pane.
``Ctrl-Shift-C (copy-node)``
    Copies the outline and all it's descendants, placing the node on the clipboard.
``Ctrl-Shift-X (cut-node)``
    Cuts the outline and all its descendants, placing the node on the clipboard.
``Ctrl-Shift-V (paste-node)``
    Pastes a node (and its descendants) from the clipboard after the presently selected node.
``Ctrl-M (mark)``
    Toggles the mark on a node. Marked nodes have a vertical red bar in their icon area.
``Ctrl-} (demote)``
    Makes all following siblings of a node children of the node. Use ``demote`` to "gather" nodes so they can all be moved with their parent.
``Ctrl-{ (promote)``
    Makes all the children of a node siblings of the node. Use ``demote`` to "scatter" the nodes after moving their parent.

Selecting outline nodes
***********************

You may select, expand and contract outline nodes with the mouse as usual, but using arrow keys is *highly recommended*. When focus is in the outline pane, *plain* arrows keys change the selected node:

``Right-arrow (expand-and-go-right)``
    Expands a node or selects its first child.
``Left-arrow (contract-or-go-left)``
    Contracts a node if its children are visible, and selects the node's parent otherwise.
``Up-arrow (goto-prev-visible)``
    Selects the previous *visible* outline node.
``Down-arrow (goto-next-visible)``
    Selects the next *visible* outline node.
  
Regardless of focus, ``Alt-arrow`` select outline nodes:

``Alt-Home (goto-first-visible-node)``
    Selects the first outline node and collapses all nodes.
``Alt-End (goto-last-visible-node)``
    Selects the last *visible* outline node and collapses all nodes except the node and its ancestors.
``Alt-arrow keys``
    Select the outline pane, and then act just like the plain arrow keys when the outline pane has focus.

Moving the cursor
*****************

When focus is in any of Leo's text panes (body pane, log pane, headlines), Leo works like most text editors:

- ``Plain arrow`` keys move the cursor up, down, left or right.
- ``Ctrl-LeftArrow`` and ``Ctrl-RightArrow`` move the cursor by words.
- ``Home`` and ``End`` move the cursor to the beginning or end of a line.
- ``Ctrl-Home`` moves the cursor to the beginning of the body text.
- ``Ctrl-End`` moves the cursor to the end of the body text.
- ``PageDown`` and ``PageUp`` move the cursor up or down one page.

**Note**: As usual, adding the ``Shift`` key modifier to any of the keys above moves the cursor and extends the selected text.

Finding & replacing text
************************

This section explains how to use Leo's standard search/replace commands.
**Note**: you can also use the Nav Tab (in the Log pane) to search for text.

``Ctrl-F (start-search)`` shows the Find Tab and puts the focus in the text box labeled ``Find:``.

**Aside**: You can select radio buttons and toggle check boxes in the Find Tab with ``Ctrl-Alt keys``. The capitalized words of the radio buttons or check boxes indicate which key to use.  For example, ``Ctrl-Alt-X (toggle-find-regex-option)`` toggles the ``regeXp`` checkbox.

After typing ``Ctrl-F``, type the search string, say ``def``, in the text box.

Start the find command by typing ``<Return>``.

But suppose you want to replace ``def`` with ``foo``, instead of just finding ``def``.

Just type ``<Tab>`` before typing ``<Return>``. Focus shifts to the text box labeled ``Replace:``.

Finally, type ``<Return>`` to start the find-next command. When Leo finds the next instance of ``def``, it will select it.

You may now type any command.  The following are most useful:

- ``Ctrl-minus (replace-then-find)`` replaces the selected text.
- ``F3 (find-next)`` continues searching without making a replacement.
- ``F2 (find-previous)`` continues the search in reverse.
- ``Ctrl-G (keyboard-quit)`` ends the search.

Formatting text
***************

``rst3``
    Converts @rst nodes to restructured text. This command automatically creates underlining for rST sections. To reorganize a document, just reorganize the corresponding Leo outline: you don't have to change markup by hand. Search or "rst" in leoSettings.leo to see the pertinent settings.
    
``adoc``
     Converts @adoc nodes to asciidoc text. This command automatically creates markup for asciidoctor sections. To reorganize a document, just reorganize the corresponding Leo outline: you don't have to change markup by hand.

Undoing and redoing changes
***************************

Leo has unlimited undo--Leo remembers *all* changes you make to outline structure or the contents of any node since you restarted Leo.

``Ctrl-Z (undo)``
    Undoes the last change. Another Ctrl-Z undoes the previous change, etc.
``Ctrl-Shift-Z (redo)``
    Undoes the effect of the last undo, etc.

The first two entries of the ``Edit`` menu show what the next undo or redo operation will be.

Clone-find commands
*******************

The **clone find** commands, cfa and cff are extraordinarily useful. These commands move clones of all nodes matching the search pattern under a single **organizer node**, created as the last top-level node. **Flattened** searches put all nodes as direct children of the organizer node::

    cfa     clone-find-all
    cff     clone-find-all-flattened
    
The **clone-marked** commands move clones of all marked nodes under an organizer node. Especially useful for gathering nodes by hand::

    cfam    clone-find-marked 
    cffm    clone-find-flattened-marked

Syncing @clean files
********************

The **check-nodes** command finds **dubious** nodes, that is, nodes that:

- contain multiple defs.
- start with leading blank lines.
- are non-organizer nodes containing no body text.

This command is specially useful when using @clean nodes in a collaborative
environment. Leo's @clean update algorithm will update @clean nodes when
others have added, deleted or moved code, but the update algorithm won't
assign changed code to the optimal nodes. This script highlights nodes that
needed attention.

**Settings**: You can customize the behavior of this command with @data nodes:

- @data check-nodes-ok-patterns

  The body of the @data node contains a list of regexes (strings), one per
  line. This command compiles each regex as if it were a raw string.
  Headlines matching any of these compiled regexes are not considered
  dubious. The defaults ignore unit tests::

    .*test_
    .*Test

- @data check-nodes-ok-prefixes

  The body of the @data node contains a list of strings, one per line.
  Headlines starting with any of these strings are not considered dubious.
  The defaults ignore top-level @<file> nodes and marker nodes::
  
    @
    **
    ==
    --

- @data check-nodes-suppressions

  The body of the @data node contains a list of strings, one per line.
  Headlines that match these suppressions *exactly* are not considered
  dubious. Default: None.

Help commands
*************

``F1 (help)``
    Shows a help message appears in the viewrendered pane. Alt-0 (vr-toggle) hides or shows this pane.
``F11 (help-for-command)``
    Shows the documentation for any Leo command. ``F11`` prompts for the name of a Leo command in the minibuffer. Use tab completion to see the list of all commands that start with a given prefix.
``F12 (help-for-python)``
    Shows the documentation from Python's help system. Typing completion is not available: type the full name of any Python module, class, function or statement.

These commands clarify which settings are in effect, and where they came from::

    print-bindings
    print-settings

These commands discuss special topics::

    help-for-abbreviations
    help-for-autocompletion
    help-for-bindings
    help-for-creating-external-files
    help-for-debugging-commands
    help-for-drag-and-drop
    help-for-dynamic-abbreviations
    help-for-find-commands
    help-for-minibuffer
    help-for-regular-expressions
    help-for-scripting

Debugger commands
*****************

``xdb``
    Start a Leo's integrated debugger in a separate thread.

    Start the debugger from any part of any @<file> tree. Now you are ready
    to execute all the db-* commands.
    
    You can execute these commands from the minibuffer, or, if the
    xdb_pane.py plugin is enabled, from the the Debug pane.
    
The following commands correspond to the pdb commands:

``db-b``
    Set a breakpoint at the line shown in Leo.
    It should be an executable line.
``db-c``
    Continue, that is, run until the next breakpoint.
``db-h``
    Print the help message (in the console, for now)
``db-l``
    List a few lines around present location.
``db-n``
    Execute the next line.
``db-q``
    End the debugger.
``db-r``
    Return from the present function/method.
``db-s``
    Step into the next line.
``db-w``
    Print the stack.

There are two additional commands:

``db-again``
    Run the previous db-command.
``db-input``
    Prompt for any pdb command, then execute it.

    The db-input command allows you can enter any pdb command at all.
    For example: "print c".

But you don't have to run these commands from the minibuffer, as discussed next.

**Setting breakpoints in the gutter**

When @bool use_gutter = True, Leo shows a border in the body pane.  By default, the line-numbering.py plugin is enabled, and if so, the gutter shows correct line number in the external file.

After executing the xdb command, you can set a breakpoint on any executable line by clicking in the gutter to the right of the line number.  You can also set a breakpoint any time the debugger is stopped.

Using the gutter is optional. You can also set breakpoints with the db-b command or by typing "d line-number" or "d file-name:line-number using the db-input command, or by using the Debug pane (see below)

**The Debug pane**

The xdb_pane.py plugin creates the Debug pane in the Log pane.  The pane contains buttons corresponding to all the commands listed above.  In addition, there is an input area in which you can enter pdb commands. This is a bit easier to use than the db-input command.

**Settings**

When @bool use_xdb_pane_output_area is True, all debugger output is sent to an output area in the Debug pane. The default is True, so you need this setting only if you don't want output set to the Debug pane.

Operations on reference .leo files
**********************************

.. .. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/yAtfcG6AL70

.. _`reference .leo files`: FAQ.html#what-is-a-reference-leo-file

These commands make it easier to use Leo's `reference .leo files`_. From time to time, developers needs to open reference Leo file and copy its content to and from their personal file. These commands use a **separation node**, a top-level node whose headline is::

    ---begin-private-area---
    
The body of the separation node contains the **.leo reference**, a path to the reference .leo file. Everything above this node is the **public part** of the outline.  Everything below this node is the **private part** of the outline.

**set-reference-file** selects the reference .leo file corresponding to the local .leo file. It creates the separation node if it doesn't exists, changing the .leo reference as needed.

**read-ref-file** reads the public part of this outline from the reference .leo file given in the separation node. **Warning**: This command **deletes all nodes above separation node**, recreating them from the reference file.

**update-ref-file** saves public part of this outline to reference .leo file.

Developers will typically execute the read-ref-file command after any git pull that changes any reference .leo file.  Similarly, devs will typically execute the update-ref-file command before doing a git commit that changes a reference .leo file.

All other commands
++++++++++++++++++

Clone-find commands
*******************

The **clone find** commands, cfa and cff,  move clones of all nodes matching the search pattern under a single **organizer node**, created as the last top-level node. **Flattened** searches put all nodes as direct children of the organizer node::

    cfa     clone-find-all
    cff     clone-find-all-flattened
    
The **clone-marked** commands move clones of all marked nodes under an organizer node. Especially useful for gathering nodes by hand::

    cfam    clone-find-marked 
    cffm    clone-find-flattened-marked
    
The `clone-find-parents` command creates clones of all parent nodes of c.p.

The `clone-find-tag` aka ``(cft)`` command creates clones of all nodes having a given tag.

The `tag-children` applies a given tag to all the children of the selected node.

Debug commands
**************

    Report lines longer than specified by:
    @bool max-find-long-lines-length = 110
``find-missing-docstrings``
    Report python classes, functions and methods lacking python docstrings.
    Does not report nodes that are descendants of @nopylint.
``pdb``
    Drops into debugger, in the middle of the command-handling logic. Get the commander by stepping out into k.masterKeyHandler or k.masterCommandHandler. Using c, one can then get all other info.
``show-buttons``
    Show all @button and @command commands, their bindings and their source.

Dumping Leo's internal data::

    dump-all-objects
    dump-new-objects
    dump-outline
    verbose-dump-objects

Python's garbage collector::

    gc-trace-disable
    gc-trace-enable

Idle time::

    disable-idle-time-events
    enable-idle-time-events
    toggle-idle-time-events
    
``print-window-state``
    This command is for Leo's developers.

Edit commands
*************

.. contents:: Contents
    :depth: 2
    :local:

Cutting, pasting and selecting text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``cut-text (Ctrl-X)``
    Cut the selected text and put it to the clipboard.
``copy-text (Ctrl-C)``
    Copy the selected text to the clipboard.
``paste-text (Ctrl-V)``
    Paste test from the clipboard.
``select-all(Ctrl-A)``
    Select all text in the text pane.

These commands work with either headline or body text.

Indenting body text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``always-indent-region``
     Shift selected lines right one tab position. Inserts one unit of indentation if no text is selected.
``indent-region (Tab)`` 
    Shift selected lines right one tab position. Inserts a tab (or spaces) if no text is selected.
``unindent-region (Shift-Tab)``
    Shifts selected lines left one tab position. Deletes one unit of indentation if no text is selected.
    
**Notes**:

- These commands shift the entire line if any characters in that line are selected. If no text is selected.

- The @tabwidth directive determines which characters these commands insert or delete.

- Leo auto indents unless @nocolor is in effect.  Typing a newline automatically inserts the same leading whitespace present on the previous line.

- If Python is the present language, Leo inserts an additional tab if the previous line ends with a colon.  When the ``smart_auto_indent setting`` is True, Leo uses Emacs-style auto-indentation instead.  This style of auto-indent aligns newly created lines with unmatched ``( [{`` brackets in the previous line.

Adding and deleting comments in body text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``add-comments (Ctrl-))``
    Adds comments to the selected lines, according to the @language
    directive in effect. These commands use single-line comments if
    possible. It's not necessary to select all of the first or last lines.
``delete-comments (Ctrl-()``
    Deletes comments in the selected lines.

Moving the cursor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``goto-global-line (Alt-G)``
    Selects the locations in your outlines corresponding to a line in a external file.
``match-brackets``
    Enabled if the cursor is next to one of these characters in the body pane: ``( ) [ ] { } < >`` The command looks for the matching character, searching backwards through the body text if the cursor is next to ``)`` ``]`` ``}`` or ``>`` and searching forward through the text otherwise. If the cursor is between two brackets the search is made for the bracket matching the leftmost bracket. If a match is found, the entire range of characters delimited by the brackets is highlighted and the cursor is placed just to the left of the matching characters. Thus, executing this command twice highlights the range of matched characters without changing the cursor.

Text formatting commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Python's time module`: http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html

``clean-lines``
    Removes trailing whitespace from all lines, preserving newlines.
``clear-selected-text``
    Delete the selected text.
``convert-tabs``
    Converts leading tabs to blanks in a single node.
``convert-blanks``
    Converts blanks to tabs in a single node.
``convert-all-tabs``
    Converts leading tabs to blanks throughout the selected tree.
``convert-all-blanks``
    Converts leading blanks to tabs throughout the selected tree.
    
**@tabwidth**: The ``convert-*`` commands convert between tabs and blanks using the @tabwidth setting presently in effect.

``insert-body-time`` and ``insert-headline-time``
    Insert formatted time and date into body or headline text. You must be editing a headline to be able to insert the time/date into the headline. The body_time_format_string and headline_time_format_string settings specify the format of the inserted text. These settings are the format string passed to time.strftime.
    
**Time format**: For format options see `Python's time module`_. By default, the commands use ``%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S``, giving timestamps like ``1/30/2003 8:31:55``.

``pretty-print-python-code`` and ``pretty-print-all-python-code``
    Pretty prints body text. You can customize this code by overriding the following methods of class prettyPrinter in leoCommands.py::

        putOperator:      puts whitespace around operators.
        putNormalToken:   puts whitespace around everything else.

``reformat-paragraph (Ctrl-Shift-P)``
    Rearranges the words in a text paragraph to fill each line as full as possible, up to the @pagewidth setting. A paragraph is delimited by blank lines, Leo directives, and (of course) start and end of text in a node. The width of the line used by the reformatting operation is governed by @pagewidth and the indentation that would be applied to the node when Leo writes the file.

The command operates on the paragraph containing the insert cursor. If the insert cursor is on a blank line or directive, nothing happens. If the cursor is on a line containing text, then the paragraph containing that text line is reformatted and the insert cursor is moved to the next paragraph.

**Note**: Hanging indentation is preserved. This is most useful for bulleted or numbered lists, such as::

  1. This is the first paragraph,
     and it has a hanging indentation.

  2. This is the second paragraph,
     and it too has a hanging indentation.
     
``replace-current-character``
     Replace the selected character with the next character typed.
``toggle-angle-brackets``
    Adds or removes double angle brackets from the headline of the selected node.
``unformat-paragraph (Ctrl-Shift-U)``
    Removes all extra whitespace from a paragraph, including leading whitespace.  This command is useful when @wrap is in effect.

Creating nodes from body text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``extract (Ctrl-Shift-D)``
    Creates a new node whose headline is the first line of selected body text and whose body is all other lines of selected text. Previously selected text is deleted from the original body text.
``extract-names (Ctrl-Shift-N)``
    Creates one or more child nodes, one for each section name in the selected body text. The headline of each created node is the section name.
``line-to-headline``
    Creates a new node whose headline is the selected body line.

Executing Python scripts in body text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``execute-script (Ctrl-B)``
    Executes body text as a Python script. Leo execute the selected text, or the entire body text if no text is selected. The Execute Script command pre-defines the values c, g and p as follows:

- c is the commander of the outline containing the script.
- g is the leoGlobals modules.
- p is c.p, that is, c.currentPosition().

**Important**: Body text may contain Leo directives and section references. You can use all of Leo's features to organize scripts that you execute interactively. Section definitions must appear in the node containing the script or in descendant nodes.

Leo preprocesses all scripts by simulating the writing of a external file to a string. The ``execute-script`` command sets app.scriptDict["script1"] to the value of the script before preprocessing, and sets app.scriptDict["script2"] to the value of the script after preprocessing. Scripts may examine and change app.scriptDict as they please.

Multiple body editors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``add-editor``
    Adds a new editor in the body pane and gives it the body editor focus.
``delete-editor``
    Deletes the editor with body editor focus.
``cycle-editor-focus``
    Cycles body editor focus between editors in the body text. The editor that has focus shows the content of the selected outline node; the other body editors continue to show the node contents they last had when they had the body editor focus.

Undoing changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Leo supports unlimited undo and redo with the ``undo`` (Ctrl-Z) and ``redo`` (Ctrl-Shift-Z) commands. Think of actions that may be undone or redone as a string of beads. A "bead pointer" points to the present bead. Performing an operation creates a new bead after the present bead and removes all following beads. Undoing an operation moves the bead pointer backwards; redoing an operation moves the bead pointer forwards. The ``undo`` command is disabled when the bead pointer moves in front of the first bead; the ``redo`` command is disabled when the bead pointer points to the last bead.

The @string undo_granularity setting controls the granularity of undo. There are four possible values:

``node``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to a new node.

``line (default)``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to new line.

``word``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing starts a new word.

``char`` (not recommended)
    Starts a new undo unit for each character typed.
    This wastes lots of computer memory.

Emacs-like commands
*******************

.. contents:: Contents
    :depth: 2
    :local:

Abbreviation commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Important**: The following describes Leo's new abbreviation scheme.  Such abbreviations *fire immediately* whenever they are completed. You do *not* have to execute a command!  By convention, abbreviations end with ``;;``, something you are not likely to type by accident, but you can pick any abbreviation you like.

**Note**:

1. The @data abbreviations-subst-env node contains a script defining the environment in which all abbreviations execute. This allows helper functions to be defined. Very handy.
   
2. Scripts may span multiple lines. Line starting with "\:" (2 characters) continue a script. This allows abbreviations to define multi-line templates.  Helpers defined in @data abbreviations-subst-env can fill in templates with *calculated* (not predefined) data.
   
3. Templates may contain placeholders that the user can fill in.  By default, the double comma binding selects the next placeholder.

4. Added a new setting: @bool scripting-abbreviations, default False. Scripting abbreviations will be enabled if *either* of the following is True::

    @bool scripting-abbreviations
    @bool scripting-at-script-nodes
    
This is a safety feature: it allows scripting abbreviations to be enabled *without* enabling the (very dangerous in general) scripting-at-script-nodes setting.

5. Added a new example node: @@data abbreviations examples.  This contains
   several extremely useful scripts.

    dabbrev-expands

Cursor movement commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Emacs cursor commands`: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Moving-Point.html#Moving-Point

**Smart cursor moves**: Many editors allow you to jump over, select and delete words, especially those containing or surrounded by special characters, in a smarter way than just "going to the beginning of the word before" (back-word) or "going to the end of the next word" (forward-word)::

    back-word-smart
    back-word-smart-extend-selection
    forward-word-smart
    forward-word-smart-extend-selection
    delete-word-smart
    backward-delete-word-smart

    find-word-in-line
    forward-char
    forward-char-extend-selection
    forward-end-word
    forward-end-word-extend-selection
    forward-page
    forward-page-extend-selection
    forward-paragraph
    forward-paragraph-extend-selection

    rectangle-close
    rectangle-delete
    rectangle-kill
    rectangle-open
    rectangle-string
    rectangle-yank

Given::

    I'm really glad the docs are being updated. I know that's a
    monumental task. I only use a fraction of Leo's commands, mostly
    because I don't even know what they're supposed to accomplish. A few
    examples:

Placing the cursor immediately before the first "I", holding shift and moving it to immediately before the word``examples`` selects a zero width rectangle from the beginning to the end of the selection (zero width because the selection starts and ends in the same column.  Then running ``rectangle-string [largo]<space><enter>`` yields::

File commands
*************

.. contents:: Contents
    :depth: 2
    :local:

Loading, saving & reverting files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``file-open-by-name``
    Gets the name of a Leo outline from the minibuffer and opens it. File name completion is supported.
``new (Ctrl-N)``
    Creates a new Leo main window.
``open-outline (Ctrl-O)``
    Opens an existing .leo file. Selecting a non-.leo file loads the file into an @edit node in the present outline.
``open-outline-by-name``
    Opens the file given by typing the filename in the minibuffer. Supports filename completion.
``read-outline-only``
    Reads only the .leo file, not any external files.
``revert``
    Reloads the outline, discarding any changes made since it was last saved.
``save-all``
    Saves all open tabs windows/tabs. 
``save-buffers-kill-leo``
    Quits Leo, prompting to save any unsaved files first. 
``save-file or file-save (Ctrl-S)``
    Saves the Leo window to a file.
``save-file-as``
    Saves a copy of the Leo outline, changing outline's file name.
``save-file-to``
    Saves a copy of the Leo outline, without changing the outline's file name
``save-file-as-zipped``
    Same as ``save-file-as``, compressing the .leo file with Python's zipfile module.
``save-file-as-unzipped``
    Same as ``save-as``, suppressing compression.


**About compression**: The ``save-file``, ``save-file-as`` and ``save-file-to`` commands compress the file if it was originally compressed. Leo always uses the .leo extension, regardless of whether the file is zipped. Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose name is the same as the .leo file itself. Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or other program to expand the .leo file contained within.

**Opening specific files**:

``open-cheat-sheet-leo``
    Opens CheatSheet.leo in a new tab or window.
``open-leoDocs-leo``
    Opens LeoDocs.leo in a new tab or window.
``open-scripts-leo``
    Opens scripts.leo in a new tab or window.
``open-leoSettings-leo``
    Opens LeoSettings.leo in a new tab or window.
    
**Writing external files without saving the outline**:

``write-at-auto-nodes``
    Writes all @auto nodes in the selected tree.
``write-outline-only``
    Saves the outline without writing any @<file> trees.
``write-at-file-nodes``
    Writes all @<file> trees.
``write-at-shadow-nodes``
    Writes all @shadow nodes in the selected tree.
``write-dirty-at-file-nodes``
    Writes all modified @<file> trees.
``write-dirty-at-shadow-nodes``
    Writes all modified @shadow trees.
``write-missing-at-file-nodes``
    Write all @<file> nodes for which the corresponding external file does not exist.

Closing outlines & quitting Leo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``close-others``
    Closes all windows except the present window.
``close-window (Ctrl-F4)``
    Closes the selected Leo window, prompting you to save your work if necessary.
``exit-leo (Ctrl-Q or Alt-F4)``
    Exits Leo, prompting you to save any changed outline. Closing the last outline tab also exits Leo.

Importing & exporting files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _CWEB:   http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html
.. _noweb:  https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/

``export-headlines``
    Exports all headlines to an external file.
``file-insert``
    Prompts for the name of a file and put the selected text into it.
``flatten-outline``
    Creates a text file in MORE format from the selected outline.

        @string zim_node_name
        @string path_to_zim

``outline-to-cweb``
    Creates a `CWEB`_ file from the selected outline.
``outline-to-noweb``
    Creates a `noweb`_ file from the selected outline.
``read-at-auto-nodes``
    Reads all @auto nodes in the presently selected outline. 
``read-at-shadow-nodes``
    Reads all @shadow nodes in the presently selected outline.
``read-at-file-nodes``
    Updates all @<file> nodes in an outline.
``read-file-into-node``
    Prompts for a filename, creates a new node and puts the contents of the file into its body text.
``refresh-from-disk``
    Refreshes an @<file> node from disk. 
``remove-sentinels``
    Removes all sentinel lines from a file derived from an @file node.
``weave``
    Formats the selected text and writes it to a file. 
``write-file-from-node``
    Writes the body text of the selected node to a file. The command prompts for a file name if the node is not an @<file> node.

Using sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``session-clear``
    Closes all tabs except the presently selected tab. 
``session-create``
    Creates a new @session node. 
``session-refresh``
    Refreshes the current @session node.

    Opens a tab for each item the selected @session node.
``session-snapshot-load``
    Loads a snapshot of a session from the leo.session file. 
``session-snapshot-save``
    Saves a snapshot of the present session to the leo.session file.

A **session** specifies a list of .leo files that Leo opens automatically when Leo first starts.  Leo will reload the last session provided that command-line arguments *don't* contain any file names.

Communicating with external editors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Idle`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE_%28Python%29
.. _`Open Office`: https://www.openoffice.org/
.. _`SciTe`: http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html

``cm-external-editor``
    Open the selected node in the external editor specified by the ``LEO_EDITOR/EDITOR`` environment variable.
``open-with-idle``
    Open the selected node in `Idle`_.
``open-with-open office``
    Open the selected node in `Open Office`_.
``open-with-scite``
    Open the selected node in `SciTe`_.
``open-with-word``
    Open the selected node in Word.

**About open-with**:

1. Leo creates a temporary file and invokes an external program. Leo periodically checks whether this temporary file has changed; Leo changes the corresponding node in the outline if so. You must create the entries using an @openwith node in myLeoSettings.leo. See the documentation there.

2. All open-with commands require that the corresponding @openwith node correctly specifies an editor.

Creating & deleting directories & files

``clone-node (Ctrl-\`)`` (Grave accent, not a single quote)
    Creates a clone as the immediate sibling of a selected node.
``clone-node-to-last-node``
    Creates a clone as the last top-level node of the outline.
``insert-node (Ctrl-I or Insert)``
    Inserts a new node into the outline.  The new node becomes the first child of the present node if the present node is expanded.  Otherwise, the new node becomes the next sibling of the present node.
``insert-node-before``
    Inserts a node before the presently selected node.
``delete-node``
    Deletes a node and all its descendants.

Expanding & contracting nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``contract-all (Alt-hyphen)``
    Contracts every node in the outline.
``contract-all-other-nodes``
    Contract all nodes except the parents of the selected node.
``contract-node``
    Contracts a node.
``contract-or-go-left (Alt-Left)``
    Contract the node if it is expanded.  Otherwise, select the node's parent.
``contract-parent``
    Select the parent of the selected node and contract it.
``expand-all``
    Expands every node in the outline.
``expand-node``
    Expands a node.
``expand-and-go-right (Alt-Right)``
    Expands a node if not expanded.  Otherwise, selects the first child if there is one.
``expand-all-subheads``
    Expand all the direct children of the selected node.
``expand-ancestors-only``
    Expand all the ancestors of the selected node.

These commands expand all descendants of the selected nodes::

    expand-next-level
    expand-prev-level (reverses expand-next-level)
    expand-to-level-1
    expand-to-level-2
    expand-to-level-3

``edit-headline``
    Begins editing of the headline of the presently-selected node.
``end-edit-headline``
    Ends editing of the headline.

Selecting nodes

**Arrow keys**: When focus is in the outline pane, you can move about the outline using *plain* arrow keys. Regardless of focus, Alt-Arrow keys select nodes in the outline pane.

``goto-first-sibling``
    Select the first sibling of the selected node.
``goto-last-sibling``
    Select the last sibling of the selected node.

Similarly, these commands select various nodes in the outline::

    goto-prev-history-node
    goto-prev-node
    goto-prev-sibling
    goto-prev-visible
    
``leoscreen-jump-to-error`` (Unix only)
    Jumps to the python error reported in the shell window, if the
    file's loaded in the current Leo session. Just looks for a line::

        File "somefile.py", line NNN, in xxx

    and looks for a node starting with "@" and ending with "somefile.py",
    then jumps to line NNN in that file.

Cutting, pasting & deleting nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``copy-node (Ctrl-Shift-C)``
    Copies a node and all its descendants to the clipboard
``cut-node (Ctrl-Shift-X)``
    Copies a node and all its descendants to the clipboard and then delete them.
``delete-node``
    Deletes a node and all its descendants.
``paste-node (Ctrl-Shift-V)``
    Pastes a node and its descendants from the outline. This commands creates *copies* of nodes, not clones.
``past-retaining-clones``
    Pastes a node and its descendants from the outline.  This command preserves the identify (gnx's) of the pasted nodes, thereby preserving any clone links. This command ensures that no newly-pasted node is an ancestor of itself.

**Outline representation**: When cutting or copying an outline to the clipboard, Leo writes the outline in the same xml (text) format used in .leo files. You may copy this text representation into a body pane (or into any other text editor) using ``Ctrl-V``.

Moving & reorganizing nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``move-outline-down (Ctrl-D or Shift-Down or Alt-Shift-Down)``
    Move the selected node down, if possible.
``move-outline-left (Ctrl-L or Shift-Left or Alt-Shift-Left)``
    Move the selected node left, if possible.
``move-outline-right (Ctrl-R or Shift-Right or Alt-Shift-Right)`` 
    Move the selected node right, if possible.
``move-outline-up (Ctrl-U or Shift-Up Alt-Shift-Up)``
    Move the selected node up, if possible.

**Alt Modifiers not needed in the outline pane**: When focus is in the outline pane, you can move nodes without adding the Alt modifier. Shift-Up moves the select node up, etc.

**Important**: The following commands reorganize groups of nodes:

``de-hoist``
    Undoes the effect of the previous ``hoist`` command.
``demote (Ctrl-])``
    Makes all following siblings of a node children of the node.
``hoist``
    Redraws the screen so presently selected tree becomes the only visible part of the outline. You may hoist an outline as many times as you wish.
``promote (Ctrl-[)``
    Makes all the children of a node siblings of the node.
``sort-children``
    Sort all children of the children of the present node by their headlines.
``sort-siblings (Alt-A)``
    Sort the present node and all its siblings by their headlines.

Converting between outlines and text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``code-to-rst``
    Format the presently selected node as computer code.
``flatten-outline-to-node``
    Appends the headline and body text of all descendants of the selected node to the body text of the selected node.
``parse-body``
    Parse p.b as source code, creating a tree of descendant nodes.
    This is essentially an import of p.b.

Dragging nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may drag a node (including all its descendants) from one place to another in an outline. To start a drag, press the main (left) mouse button while the cursor is over the icon for a node. The cursor will change to a hand icon. If you release the mouse button while the hand cursor is above another node, Leo will move the dragged node after that node. If you release the mouse button when the hand cursor is not over a node, Leo will leave the outline pane as it is. Leo scrolls the outline pane as the result of mouse-moved events, so to continue scrolling you must keep moving the mouse.

If the recipient node has children and is expanded, the dropped node will be inserted as the first child of the recipient node, otherwise the dropped node will be inserted after the recipient node.

Holding down Alt before releasing the node will force insertion as a child of the recipient node, even if the recipient node is not expanded. Holding down Control before releasing the node will cause a clone to be dropped, leaving the original where it was.

Marking nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``copy-marked``
    Copies all marked nodes as children of a new node. 
``diff-marked-nodes``
    When exactly two nodes are marked, this command creates a diff node as the last top-level node whose children are clones of the marked nodes.
``goto-next-marked``
    Selects the next marked node.
``mark (Ctrl-M)``
    Marks node if it is unmarked, and unmarks the node if it is already marked.
``mark-changed-items``
    Marks all nodes whose headline or body text has been changed since the file was last saved.
``mark-subheads``
    Marks all children of the presently selected node.
``marked-list``
    Lists all marked nodes in the Nav pane.
``unmark-all``
    Unmarks all marked nodes in the outline.

**Marking groups of nodes**: Leo's find and change commands mark nodes if the "Mark Changes" and "Mark Finds" checkboxes are checked. You can change these checkboxes with the ``toggle-find-mark-changes-option`` and ``toggle-find-mark-finds-option`` commands.

Operations on marked nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``clone-marked-nodes``
    Makes clones of all marked nodes and moves them to be children of the present position.
``delete-marked-nodes``
    Deletes all marked nodes.
``move-marked-nodes``
    Moves all nodes to be children of the present position.

Comparing outlines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``file-compare-leo-files``
    Prompts for another (presumably similar) .leo file that will be compared with the presently selected outline file (main window). It then creates clones of all inserted, deleted and changed nodes.
``file-diff-files``
    Creates a node and puts the diff between 2 files into it.

Using Chapters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

@chapter trees define chapters. Selecting a chapter makes only those nodes in the chapter visible, much like a hoist. The ``main`` chapter represents the entire outline. Selecting the ``main`` chapter shows all outline nodes.

``chapter-select-main``
    Selects the main chapter.
    
``chapter-select-<chapter-name>``
    Each @chapter node in the outline creates a corresponding chapter-select command.
    
``chapter-next``
    Selects the next chapter.
    
``chapter-back``
    Selects the previous chapter.

Associated settings:

``@bool use_chapters``
    True: chapters are enabled.

..  ``@bool use_chapter_tabs``
..    True: chapters pop-up menu appears in the icon area.

Plugins commands
****************

``act-on-node``
    Executes node-specific action, typically defined in a plugins as follows::

        import leo.core.leoPlugins

        def act_print_upcase(c,p,event):
            if not p.h.startswith('@up'):
                raise leo.core.leoPlugins.TryNext
            p.h = p.h.upper()

        g.act_on_node.add(act_print_upcase)

    This will upcase the headline when it starts with @up.

Plugins create the following commands::

Search & spell commands
***********************

.. contents:: Contents

    :local:

Basic searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basic searches:

``start-search (Ctrl-F)``
    Prompts for a search string. Typing the ``Return`` key puts the search string in the Find tab and executes a search based on all the settings in the Find tab. Type ``Tab`` to enter replacement text.
``find-next (F3)``
    Continues a search started with ``Ctrl-F``.
``find-previous (F2)``
    Searches backwards using the present search options.
``replace (Ctrl-=)``
    Replaces the selected text with the 'change' text in the Find tab.
``replace-then-find (Ctrl--)``
    Replaces the selected text with the 'change' text in the Find tab, then executes the find command again.

Batch searches:

``find-all``
    Prints all matches in the log pane.
``replace-all``
    Changes all occurrences of the 'find' text with the 'change' text.
    When using the minibuffer to specify search and replace patterns,
    first enter then search pattern,
    then type ``Tab`` and enter the replacement pattern:
    
    <Alt-x>replace-all<return>find-pattern<tab>replacement-pattern<return>
    
Searches creating clones:

``clone-find-all-flattened`` aka ``(cfaf)``
    Prompts for a find, then creates clones of all found nodes in an organizer node.
``clone-find-all`` aka ``(cfa)``
    Same as ``clone-find-all-flattened``, but does not create duplicate cloned nodes. If a node is a descendant of another found node, no duplicate top-level node (in the organizer) is created.
``clone-find-marked`` aka ``(cfm)`` and ``clone-find-marked-flattened`` aka ``(cfmf)``
    Creates clones of all marked nodes.
``clone-find-parents``
    Creates an organizer node containing clones of all the parents of the selected node.

Incremental find commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Incremental find commands move through the text as you type individual characters. Typing ``BackSpace`` backtracks the search. To repeat an incremental search, type the shortcut for that command again. Here are Leo's incremental find commands::

    Alt+R isearch-backward
          isearch-backward-regexp
    Alt+I isearch-forward
          isearch-forward-regexp
          isearch-with-present-options

Word search and regex search commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following commands work like ``F3 (start-search)`` with various options set:

``search-backward``
    Searches in the reverse direction.
``word-search-backward`` and ``word-search-forward``
    Sets 'Whole Word' checkbox to True.
``re-search-forward`` and ``re-search-backward``
    Set the 'Regexp' checkbox to True.

Check boxes and their commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following check boxes options appear in the Find pane:

``Ignore Case``
    When checked, the Find and Change commands ignore the case of alphabetic characters when determining matches.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+I (toggle-find-ignore-case-option)`` toggles this checkbox.

``Mark Changes``
    When checked, the Change command marks all headlines whose headline or body text are changed by the command.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+C (toggle-find-mark-changes-option)`` toggles this checkbox.

``Mark Matches``
    When checked, the Find and Change commands mark all headlines in which a match is found with the pattern.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+F (toggle-find-mark-finds-option)`` toggles this checkbox.

``Pattern Match``
    When checked, the Find and Change commands treat several characters specially in the find pattern.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+X (toggle-find-regex-option)`` toggles this checkbox.
    
::

    '*'  matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
    '.'  matches any single character.
    '^'  matches a newline at the start of a pattern.
    '$'  matches a newline at the end of a pattern.

    Examples::

    "^abc$" matches lines that only contain "abc".
    "^a" matches any line starting with "A".
    "a$" matches any line ending with "a".
    "^*$" matches any line at all.

``Search Body Text``
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search body text.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+B (toggle-find-in-body-option)`` toggles this checkbox.

``Search Headline Text``
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search headline text.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+H (toggle-find-in-headline-option)`` toggles this checkbox.

``Whole Word``
    When selected, the find pattern must match an entire word. Words consist of an alphabetic character or underscore, followed by zero or more alphabetic characters, numbers or underscores.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+W (toggle-find-word-option)`` toggles this checkbox.

``Wrap Around``
    When checked, the Find and Change commands continues at the top of the file when the command reaches the bottom of the file. For reverse searches, the find or change command continues at the bottom of the file when the command reaches the top of the file.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+A (toggle-find-wrap-around-option)`` toggles this checkbox.

Radio buttons and their commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following radio buttons appear in the Find pane:

``Entire Outline``
    When selected, Find commands search the entire outline.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+E (set-find-everywhere)`` sets this radio button.

``Node Only``
    When selected, Find commands search only the selected node.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+N (set-find-node-only)`` sets this radio button
    
``Suboutline Only``
    When selected, the Find and Change commands search only the currently
    selected headline and its offspring.
    
    ``Alt+Ctrl+S (set-find-suboutline-only)`` sets this radio button.

The following commands refer to spell-as-you-type mode:

``spell-as-you-type-next``
    Cycle the word behind (left of, for ltr languages) the cursor through the full list of suggestions.
``spell-as-you-type-toggle``
    Toggle spell as you type mode.  When enabled, word ending keystrokes will put a short list of suggestions in the log window, if the word is unknown to the speller.  Only shows the first 5 suggestions, even if there are more.
``spell-as-you-type-undo``
    Undo the last spelling correction.
``spell-as-you-type-wrap``
    Toggle wrapping in spell-as-you-type mode.

Code beautification commands
****************************

.. _`PEP8`: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

``beautify-node``
    Beautifies the Python code in the selected node.
``beautify-tree``
    Beautifies all the Python code in the selected tree.
``beautify-c``
    Reformats all C code in the selected tree.
    
These commands skip any nodes for which @language python (or c) is not in effect.

The **Python beautifier** (beautify-tree and beautify-node) is `PEP8`_ compliant. The beautifier will *just work* for most people. 

The Python beautifier works only on syntactically correct code. It issues a warning and does nothing for syntactically incorrect code.

Comparison with Black
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Black`: https://github.com/psf/black

Leo's beautify command differs from `Black`_ as follows:

- beautify never changes Leo's sentinel comments.
- beautify never splits or joints lines (with the default settings).
  Black sometimes inserts horrible line breaks.
- beautify never converts single-quote strings to double-quote strings.
  That is, beautify simulates Black's --skip-string-normalization command-line option.
- beautify doesn't insert extra blank lines at the end of nodes.
  Technically, this is a pep8 violation, but these extra lines are not Leonine.

Beautifier directives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``@killbeautify``
    This directive completely disables beautification for an entire tree. This is typically required for files containing ``@all``.

``@beautify`` and ``@nobeautify``
    These directives apply to a node and its descendants, until overridden later in a descendants. Both these directives may appear in the same node.  Such **ambiguous directives** do not affect the beautification of descendant nodes.  If both ``@beautify`` and ``@nobeautify`` appear in a node, the first directive determines whether the node will be beautified.
    
For example::

    @beautify
    ...
    @nobeautify

beautifies the entire node.  Otoh::

    @nobeautify
    ...
    @beautify

skips beautification of the entire node. Yes, this is less precise than one could imagine, but it's good enough for now.

Stand-alone beautifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run leoBeautify.py from the command line::

    python -m leo.core.leoAst --orange file1, file2...
    
Running::

    python -m leo.core.leoAst -h
    
Produces something like this::

    usage: leoAst.py [-h] [--fstringify | --fstringify-diff | --orange | --orange-diff] [--allow-joined] [--max-join N]
                     [--max-split N] [--recursive] [--tab-width N]
                     [PATHS ...]

    Execute fstringify or beautify commands contained in leoAst.py.

    positional arguments:
      PATHS              directory or list of files

    options:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      --fstringify       fstringify PATHS
      --fstringify-diff  fstringify diff PATHS
      --orange           beautify PATHS
      --orange-diff      diff beautify PATHS
      --allow-joined     allow joined strings
      --max-join N       max unsplit line length (default 0)
      --max-split N      max unjoined line length (default 0)
      --recursive        include directories recursively
      --tab-width N      tab-width (default -4)
