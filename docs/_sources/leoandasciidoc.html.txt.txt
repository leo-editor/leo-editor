Leo and Asciidoctor
##########################

**New with Leo 6.1**

The Leo `@adoc` directive and the `adoc` command need either **Asciidoc3** or **Asciidoctor** tool installed and in PATH.Asciidoctor is probably the best of the two to use.

**Linux:** use your system package manager or ruby `gem install asciidoctor`. More info at https://asciidoctor.org/#installation


**Windows:** installing on Windows is not straightforward as one needs to install Ruby first. Asciidoc3 isn't the straightest either, but enough that it can be shortened to couple of instructions, namely::


    pip install asciidoc3
       # stuff happens
    
    asciidoc3_postinstall
       # more stuff happens
    
    #now asciidoc3 is ready and Leo can use it:
    asciidoc3 --help
