From the movie, My Cousin Vinny::

    Mona Lisa Vito: So what's your problem?
    Vinny Gambini: My problem is, I wanted to win my first case
    without any help from anybody.
    Mona Lisa: Well, I guess that plan's moot.
    Vinny : Yeah.
    Mona Lisa: You know, this could be a sign of things to come.
    You win all your cases, but with somebody else's help, right?
    You win case after case, and then afterwards you have to go up
    to somebody and you have to say, "thank you."
    [pause]
    Oh my God, what a fucking nightmare!

Leo owes much of its visual design to MORE, possibly the most elegant computer program ever written. |br|
More inspired Leo's cloned nodes.

Leo's very important people:

- David Brock wrote TSyntaxMemo, used in early versions of Leo.
- Terry Brown wrote important plugins, including Leo's user-modifiable panes.
- e inspired @button nodes, a brilliant idea.
- The late Bob Fitzwater kept me focused on design. |br|
  Oh, how I wish he could see today's Leo.
- Jonathan M. Gilligan showed how to put the Leo icon in Leo's windows.
- The Jupyter development team taught me how to support pygments colorizing.
- Brian Harry contributed numerous plugins, including a prototype for Leo's minibuffer, and wrote jyLeo: Leo in Jython.
- Almar Klein wrote pyzo, yoton and flexx, the basis of LeoWapp (--gui=browser).
- Donald Knuth invented the CWEB language and literate programming.
- The late Bernhard Mulder invented the @shadow algorithm, the foundation of @clean. |br|
  Bernhard also inspired Leo's generators and position class.
- Joe Orr created LeoVue and XSLT stylesheets for Leo.
- John K. Ousterhout created tcl/Tk, used in early versions of Leo.
- Виталије Милошевић, (Vitalije Milosevic) made vital code-level contributions.
- Tsuchi Noko created transparent icons.
- Neal Norwitz wrote PyChecker.
- Félix Malboeuf wrote LeoInteg, LeoJS, leoserver.py and leoclient.py.
- Marc-Antoine Parent urged me to use XML for Leo's file format and helped improve it.
- Paul Paterson created the plugin architecture, helped with spell checking and contributed many plugins.
- François Pinard wrote pymacs, the foundation of Leo's emacs bridge.
- Norman Ramsey created noweb and gave permission to quote from the noweb web documentation.
- Edward K. Ream is Leo's project leader and chief programmer.
- Rich Ries has contributed a huge number of suggestions.
- Guido van Rossum created Python.
- Steven P. Schaefer pointed out security problems.
- Gil Shwartz helped with unicode support.
- Phil Straus has been a great friend and constant support.
- Kent Tenney contributed key insights about vnodes and lobbied to make Leo easier to use.
- Ville M. Vainio contributed to the one-node world, the IPython bridge and several plugins.
- Paul S. Wilson greatly improved Leo's Wikipedia entry.
- Dave Winer created MORE, the foundation of Leo's visual design.
- Dan Winkler helped support Leo on the Mac.

Special thanks to my family. My brother, David Speed Ream, tested Leo and made many useful suggestions. Rebecca, James and Linda make it all worthwhile. During a conversation with Rebecca I realized that MORE could be used as a prototype for Leo. That was a crucial first step.
