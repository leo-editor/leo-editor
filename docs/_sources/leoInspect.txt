The leoInspect Module
#######################

The leoInspect module provides answers to questions about Python
source code such as:

- Where are all assignments to 'w' in leoEditCommands.py?

- Which of those assignments are "unusual" in some way?

The leoInspect module grew out of a re-imagining of the new-pylint
project, which has been a "hobby" project of mine for several years.
Rather than attempting global "proofs" of difficult propositions, as
new-pylint does, the leoInspect module answers specific questions
about modules, functions, classes, methods and statements. We can use
such answers while debugging, or as documentation, or especially as
the foundation for *fast* unit tests.

The leoInspect module provides answers to questions about Python
source code. leoInspect is an elegant and easy-to-use front end for
Python's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) trees *and* a window into a richly
connected set of semantic data built *from* AST trees.

The simplicity of the leoInspect module could be called "third
generation" simplicity. Several implementation Ahas lie behind it.

A query language
++++++++++++++++

Mathematica's expressions inspired the design of the query language:
simple and task oriented. All details in the background. leoInspect
makes *Python* the query language! Let's see how.

All queries start with a call to leoInspect.module::

    import leo.core.leoInspect as inspect
    o = inspect.module('leoApp.py')
    
The call to inspect.module creates a **query object** o representing
all the data contained in the AST for leoApp.py. But this query object
*also* represents a **context**, a module, class, function, method or
statement.

For any context o, we can use **getters** to get lists of other contexts::

    aList = o.calls()      # All function/method calls in context o.
    aList = o.classes()    # All classes in context o.
    aList = o.functions()  # All functions in context o.
    aList = o.statements() # All the statements in context o.
    
Assignments and calls are especially important for queries. The following
getters return the assignments related to some name s::

    aList = o.assignments_to(s)
    aList = o.assignments_using(s)
    aList = o.calls_to(s)
    aList = o.call_args_of(s)
    
The o.name getter returns the name of any module, class, method,
function or var::

    s = o.name()
    
The o.format getter returns a human-readable representation of a
context's AST tree::

    s = o.format()
    
These getters generally make it unnecessary to access AST trees
directly: ASTs are merely part of the "plumbing" of the leoInspect
module. However, the o.tree getter returns the actual AST tree if you
really need it::

    ast_tree = o.tree()

Let's see how to create actual queries. Here is a script to discover
all assignments to 'w' in leoEditCommands.py is::

    import leo.core.leoInspect as inspect
    m = inspect.module('leoEditCommands.py')
    for a in m.assignments_to('w'):
        print(a.format())
        
It is easy to "zero in" on particular classes or method using the
o.name getter. The following script prints all assignments to the
'files' ivar of the LoadManager class in leoApp.py::

    import leo.core.leoInspect as inspect
    m = inspect.module('leoApp.py')
    for theClass in m.classes():
        if theClass.name() == 'LoadManager':
            for a in m.assignments_to('files'):
                print(a.format())

We have seen that the getters hide all the messy details of Python AST
trees. This is a revolution in using AST trees!

Comparing leoInspect and Pylint
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Could one create a lint-like programming using leoInspect? Perhaps,
but much more work would be required. Indeed, pylint is an extremely
capable program. It can make complex deductions that are presently far
beyond leoInspect's capabilities.

However, leoInspect is an elegant front end. It might serve
as the basis of more complex analysis. Multi-pass algorithms are often
*faster* and more elegant than single-pass algorithms, so the "extra"
overhead of the leoInspect prepass is probably not significant. What
matters are the deductions that can be made using leoInspect.Context
data.

Speed is not an obstacle for a lint-like tool based on leoInspect.
Indeed, the module getter creates *all* the context data in a very
fast pass over the modules AST tree. It takes about 4.6 seconds to
create the context data for all 34 of Leo's source files. Because
getters are extremely fast, even complex queries will be fast. A
multiple-pass query will typically take about 0.1 sec per pass. Using
AstFormatter in the InspectTraverser class adds a negligible amount of
time, less than 10% of the total tree-traversal time.

Still to do
+++++++++++

The assignments_to, assignments_using and the new calls_to getters all
specify a **pattern** to be matched against the the lhs of assignments
(or against function names in the calls_to getter).  At present, the
pattern must match as a plain word match, but it would be more natural
to use regex matches.  That's coming.

Three new getters would give leoInspect the ability to replace
refactored code:

- o.token_range: Returns pointers the list of tokens comprising o.

- o.text: Returns o's source text (a string).

- o.text_range: Returns the starting and ending offsets of the text in the file.

These getters are non-trivial to do, but a reasonable design is in place.

Theory of operation
+++++++++++++++++++

.. _`this post`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/62f0e7b84a25e0d0/39f848ad8a96bcbc

The module getter creates *all* the data used by the other getters.
This data is a richly-linked set of Context objects. Getters are very
fast because the getter of an object o merely returns one of o's
ivars.

The o.format getter is an exception. It traverses o's AST to create
the human-readable representation of o.

The AstFormatter class is a straightforward recursive descent algorithm.

The InspectTraverser.do_Attribute method uses the *formatting* code to
compute the value of the attribute. This replaces complex
AST-traversal code with a call to the formatter.

Getters
*******

Getters all follow roughly the same pattern.  For example::

    def assignments_to (self,s,all=True):
        
        format,result = self.formatter.format,[]
    
        for assn in self.assignments(all=all):
            tree = assn.tree()
            kind = self.ast_kind(tree)
            if kind == 'Assign':
                for target in tree.targets:
                    lhs = format(target)
                    if s == lhs:
                        result.append(assn)
                        break
            else:
                assert kind == 'AugAssign',kind
                lhs = format(tree.target)
                if s == lhs:
                    result.append(assn)
    
        return result
        
This is AST-traversal code. Indeed, the tree getter returns an AST,
and ast_kind is an internal getter that returns the AST type for an
AST node.

This code is elegant. It uses the assignments getter to get the list
of all assignments in this context and all contained (descendant)
contexts. All public getters are members of the base Context class, so
this code code "just works" for *all* contexts. Furthermore,
assignments are StatementContext objects, so they "just work" as
elements returned by the getter. Comparing this code with the code
found in pylint shows how elegant this code truly is.

No simpler code is possible. AST trees for assignments are a bit
different from AST trees for augmented assignments. Once the type of
assignment is identified, the code simply *formats* the left hand side
(lhs) of the assignment, and compares s with the lhs. If there is a
match, the entire assignment is appended to the result.

Computing token ranges
**********************

This section describes the how the unfinished o.token_range getter will work.

There are two parts to the problem...

Token-info prepass
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each node N of a module's tree, we want to inject the following
two new ivars:

- N.end_lineno: the line number of the last character of the token.

- N.end_col_offset: the (byte) offset of the last character of the token.

**Important**: tree structure is irrelevant when computing these fields: we
simply want a **sorted** list of (N.lineno,No.col_offset, N) tuples!

The prepass will use ast.walk(root), to generate the list.  After
sorting the list, the prepass will inject inject N.end_lineno and
N.end_col_offset ivars into each node N by stepping through the list.
The ending values of the previous node on the list are the the same as
the beginning values of the next node on the list.

This prepass need only be done once per module.

token_range
^^^^^^^^^^^

To compute token_range for a *particular* N, we want to discover
values M.end_lineno and M.end_col_offset for M, the **last** token in
N's entire tree.

token_range will do the prepass on the modules tree if necessary.
token_range will then call ast.walk(N) to discover all of N's nodes,
sort the list, and return the last element of the list!

token_range will, by its design, include *all* text in the range,
including comments.
