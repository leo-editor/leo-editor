What's new in Leo 5.6
+++++++++++++++++++++



Highlights
**********

- A new console gui for Leo.
- Added git-diff command
- Added listen-to-log and kill-log-listen commands.
- Added "yes/no to all" buttons for externally changed file dialog
- Leo switches between git branches more smoothly.

#488: Created a console gui for Leo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new chapter in Leo's documentation: http://leoeditor.com/console-gui.html

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/488

#501: git-diff command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/501

The new git-diff command shows the diffs between any uncommitted work and git's HEAD in an outline. This is, by far, the best outline-oriented diff in Leo's history. The command works for all kinds of external files.

**Outline organization**

This command creates a single tree as the last top-level node of the outline::

  - git diff  # The single organizer node for the command
    - file A  # The organizer node for file A.
              # Body contains the text diff of the entire file.
      - Added # An organizer node for all added nodes, created only if necessary.
        - node 1 # A copy of the first added node.
        - node 2 # A copy of the second added node.
            ...
      - Deleted  # An organizer node for all deleted nodes, created only if necessary.
        - node 1 # A copy of the first deleted node.
            ...
      - Changed  # An organizer node for all changed nodes, created only if necessary.
        - node 1 # An organizer node for the changed node.
                 #  Body contains the text diff of that node.
          - old: node1 # A copy of the old node.
          - new: node1 # A copy of the new node.

This command does not use git diff in any way. For example, moving a node affects only the overall diff in the organizer node for the file. Moved nodes do not otherwise appear in the diff.

**Text diffs**

Organizer nodes for files and changed nodes contain text diffs. Diffs look like this::

**Settings**

leoSettings.leo contains new colorizer settings for @language patch.

**Theory of operation**

For each diffed file, this command uses a variant of the atFile read logic to create the corresponding outline in a hidden commander.  Separate hidden commanders contain the "before" and "after" versions of the file. These outlines preserve gnx's, so it is easy to create dicts of inserted, deleted and changed nodes.  The command uses difflib (not git diff) to create all diffs, after the external file has been split into nodes.

#505: Leo switches between git branches properly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/505

The new code eliminates hidden time bombs when switching branches.

Changes to read/write code:
- at.writeAll writes files at most once.
- at.write updates cache. Previously only at.read updated the cache!
- at.deleteUnvisitedNodes no longer creates resurrected nodes.
- at.new_createThinChild4 *always* updates headlines.
- at.terminateBody just sets v.tempRoots. It no longer calls at.indicateNodeChanged.
- fc.handleNodeConflicts reports changed headlines differently.

Changes to cacher code:
- Added cacher.checkForChangedNodes.
- Added tempRoots logic.
- Added always_warn switch to cacher.reportIfNodeChanged.

Added "yes/no to all" buttons for externally changed file dialog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rev 9c94fec36d adds Yes / no to all on external file changes.

If you answer yes to all or no to all Leo remembers that
answer for 3 seconds. As a result, another set of external
changes will show the pop up again.

Code
****

- Removed confusing "atAuto" switch from AtFile class.
- Rewrote Leo's at-file read code.
- Rewrote Leo's redraw code, adding c.redraw_later.
- Unit tests now work on all all platforms without failing.

- push-cursor and pop_cursor
- show-color-names and show-color-wheel
- start-of-line and finish-line

Highlights
**********

::

    Leo 5.1 b2 released April 10, 2015.
    @clean outlines create external files without sentinels.
    Leo regularly checks the integrity of the outline.
    Up/Down arrows in the minibuffer cycle though command history.
    http://leoeditor.com/load-leo.html displays .leo files in the browser.
    Leo now honors @language inside @doc parts.
    @data nodes can now be composed from a tree of nodes.
        This feature appeared in Leo 5.0, but was not documented.
    Added @int qt-cursor-width setting.
    Added g.IdleTime & LeoQtGui.IdleTime.

Commands & settings
*******************

    Added g.getLanguageAtPosition. Should have been done long ago.

Why @clean is so important
**************************

@clean is a long-sought breakthrough. For the first time, Leo can be used in *all* situations without compromise.  There is no longer any need to make excuses for sentinel lines, or argue whether people should accept them.  Sentinels are simply gone.

The Mulder/Ream update algorithm
********************************

Leo updates @clean trees using a simplified version of the Mulder update algorithm previously used to update @shadow trees. This algorithm  is easy to understand, provably correct and completely documented. It may be of interest to the developers of other outliners.

        @data nodes can be composed from descendant nodes
        Leo's main style sheet can be customized with @color and @font settings

A plugable architecture for @auto nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The leo/plugins/importers folders now contains importer plugins.

The leo/plugins/writers folders now contain writer plugins.

Both importer and writer plugins can defined new kinds of @auto nodes.

Importers and writers can register either @auto-names or file extensions. For example, @auto x.xyzzy will use both the importer and the writer for the .xyzzy extension, that is, importers/test.py and writers/test.py. So, for *unique* extensions, there is no need to use a separate @auto name, you can just use @auto.
