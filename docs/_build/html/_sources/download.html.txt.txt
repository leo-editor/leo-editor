Downloading Leo
###############

There are two ways to download Leo:

- ``pip install leo`` will automatically download *and* install Leo, including all Leo's dependencies, less a couple of non-essential things. See `Installing Leo with pip`_.

- Recommended: install Leo using `git`_, see `Installing Leo with git`_. Git gives you the latest, thoroughly tested code with nothing missing.

- If you prefer a new development version and don't want to use git download a `Nightly snapshot`_.

.. - All in one `Standalone leo.exe`_ (Windows only) - complete package with all dependencies. Just download, unzip and run.

Snapshots
+++++++++

.zip snapshots can be downloaded directly from `GitHub <https://github.com/leo-editor>`_. No account is required.  The downloaded file will have a name like::

  leo-editor-50c070b715b9fec50c31be5853055a0ebc72cad5.zip

where the ``50c0...cad5`` part is the ID or fingerprint of the version you've downloaded.  Except "Latest", which is just ``leo-editor-master.zip``.

Here are direct download links for the "devel" branch, which changes frequently and contains all recent bug fixes:

  - `Latest devel <https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel.zip>`_
  - `devel: 1 day ago <https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel@{1%20day%20ago}.zip>`_
  - `devel: 2 days ago <https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel@{2%20days%20ago}.zip>`_
  - `devel: 5 days ago <https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel@{5%20days%20ago}.zip>`_
  - `devel: 10 days ago <https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel@{10%20days%20ago}.zip>`_
  - `devel: 30 days ago <https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel@{30%20days%20ago}.zip>`_
  - `devel: 90 days ago <https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel@{90%20days%20ago}.zip>`_


Here are direct download links for the "master" branch, which rarely changes and contains the most stable code:

Getting to the archive in order to download is a bit of work as there isn't a stable url.

Getting to the latest leo.exe:

 1. Navigate to **Actions**
 2. Select `Build standalone leo.exe`_ from workflow list in the left table of contents
 3. Look for a recent event with a check mark and click on it
 4. Look for **Artifacts** heading and under it: **leo-windows-exe** in blue.
