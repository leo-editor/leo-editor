From the movie, My Cousin Vinny::

    Mona Lisa Vito: So what's your problem?
    Vinny Gambini: My problem is, I wanted to win my first case
    without any help from anybody.
    Mona Lisa: Well, I guess that plan's moot.
    Vinny : Yeah.
    Mona Lisa: You know, this could be a sign of things to come.
    You win all your cases, but with somebody else's help, right?
    You win case after case, and then afterwards you have to go up
    to somebody and you have to say, "thank you."
    [pause]
    Oh my God, what a fucking nightmare! 

Leo owes much of its visual design to MORE, possibly the most elegant computer program ever written. Leo's clone nodes are inspired by MORE.

**Leo's VIPs**

::

    When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
    I all alone beweep my outcast state,
    And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
    And look upon myself and curse my fate,
    Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
    Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
    Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,
    With what I most enjoy contented least;
    Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
    Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
    (Like to the lark at break of day arising
    From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
           For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
           That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

    —William Shakespeare, Sonnet 29.

Special thanks to my family. My brother, David Speed Ream, tested Leo and made many useful suggestions. Rebecca, James and Linda make it all worthwhile. During a conversation with Rebecca I realized that MORE could be used as a prototype for Leo. That was a crucial first step.
