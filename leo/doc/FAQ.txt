.. @+node:ekr.20090212054250.5: *3* Getting Leo
.. @+node:ekr.20090501091345.2: *4* @rst-option show-sections = False
.. @+node:ekr.20090212054250.6: *5* Where can I get official releases of Leo?
You can get the latest official releases of Leo at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&package_id=29106

However, if at all possible, it is better to use bzr to get the latest sources.  See the next entry.
.. @+node:ekr.20080603124653.1: *5* How do I use bzr to get the latest sources from Leo's launchpad site?
Many users will want to track the development version of Leo, in order to stay
on top of the latest features and bugfixes. Running the development version is
quite safe and easy, and it's also a requirement if you want to contribute to
Leo.

1. First, you need to get Bazaar (bzr) from http://bazaar-vcs.org. For windows
   users we recommend the standalone installer - the python installer may have
   problems pushing to Launchpad. Plain bzr installer only contains the command
   line version, so you might want to augment that with a friendly GUI - qbzr is
   recommended as it's the easiest one to install. It provides command like
   'bzr qlog', 'bzr qannotate' etc.

2. Get Leo from launchpad by doing::

    bzr branch lp:leo-editor

And that's it! You can run the launchLeo script (in the top-level branch directory) directly.
When you want to refresh the code with latest modifications from Launchpad, 'run bzr pull'.

If you make modifications to Leo (with the interest in sharing them with the Leo
community), you can check them in to your local branch by doing 'bzr checkin'.
Now, to actually request your changes to be merged to Leo trunk, you need a
Launchpad account with RSA keys in place. There is showmedo video about how to
accomplish this on Windows using puttygen and pageant at
http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=1510070&fromSeriesID=151.

After your Launchpad account is set up, go to
https://launchpad.net/leo-editor, choose Code tab -> Register Branch, select
Branch type "Hosted" and fill in descriptive details about the branch. After
that, go to the branch home page from Code tab again, and copy-paste the push
command line to terminal. For example, for branch::

 https://code.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick

The push command is::

 bzr push bzr+ssh://my_name@bazaar.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick

You may wish to add --remember command line option to bzr push, to direct all
future pushes to that location. Then, you only need to execute 'bzr push'.

After your branch is pushed, you can email the Leo mailing list and request it
to be reviewed and merged to trunk.

.. @+node:ekr.20090202191501.7: *5* Leo's installer failed, what do I do?
You can simply unpack Leo anywhere and run from there.  You don't need the
installer.

From a console window, cd to the top-level leo folder.  Run Leo as follows::

    python launchLeo.py

To run Leo with Qt look and feel, use the --gui=qt option::

    python launchLeo.py --gui=qt

To load Leo's source, load leoPyRef.leo::

    python launchLeo.py --gui=qt leo\\core\\leoPyRef.leo
.. @+node:ekr.20060329101442: *5* Nothing (or almost nothing) happens when I start Leo.  What should I do?
Missing modules can cause installation problems.
If the installer doesn't work (or puts up a dialog containing no text), you may install Leo from the .zip file
as described at `How to install Leo on Windows`_.
However you are installing Leo,
be sure to `run Leo in a console window`_.
because as a last resort Leo prints error messages to the console.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.75: *5* Leo is hanging on my Linux box.  What should I do?
From: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=1685399

When building Tcl on Linux, do not specify "--enable-threads"
Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.

Here is how to build Tk without thread support:

- Go to www.tcl.tk, and download the sources for Tcl and Tk.
- Build those two pack's as is told in the "How to Compile Tcl Source Releases"
- Go to www.python.org and download your favorite Python (2.3.5 for me).
- Build it as is told on the download page.
- Enjoy using Leo on Linux.
.. @+node:ekr.20070623145346.1: *5* Running Python setup.py install from the leo directory doesn't work.  Why not?
Leo's setup.py script is intended only to create source distributions. It can't
be used to install Leo because Leo is not a Python package.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.1: *3* Learning to use Leo
.. @+node:ekr.20090501093330.2: *4* @rst-option show-sections = False
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.2: *5* What's the best way to learn to use Leo?
First, read the tutorial_. This will be enough to get you started if you just
want to use Leo as an outliner_. If you intend to use Leo for programming, read
the `Quick start for programmers`_, then look at Leo's source code in the file LeoPy.leo.
Spend 5 or 10 minutes browsing through the outline. Don't worry about details;
just look for the following common usage patterns:

-   The (Projects) tree shows how to use clones to represent tasks.

-   Study @thin leoNodes.py.
    It shows how to define more than one class in single file.

-   Most other files show how to use a single @others directive to define one class.

-   Most methods are defined using @others, *not* section definition nodes.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.4: *5* Why should I use clones?
.. _`Clones & views`:   intro.html#clones-views

You will lose much of Leo's power if you don't use clones.
See `Clones & views`_ for full details.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.5: *5* Which should I use: @root trees or @thin trees?
Use @thin trees unless you are *sure* you must have the extra flexibility of @root trees.
Indeed, @thin trees are much easier to use than @root trees:

- @thin trees use less markup than @root trees.
  In particular, the @others directive is valid only within @thin trees.

- You must explicitly tangle_ and untangle_ @root trees using the `Tangle and Untangle`_ commands.

However, @root trees are more flexible than @thin trees:

- Sections_ may be defined anywhere within @root trees.
  Moreover, the @unit directive_ expands the scope of section definitions in @root trees
  so that a section may be referenced in several @root trees.

- The meaning of section definitions in @root trees are independent of their position within the tree.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.7: *5* When is using a section better than using a method?
Use methods for any code that is used (called or referenced) more than once.

Sections_ are convenient in the following circumstances:

-   When you want to refer to snippets of code the can not be turned into methods.
    For example, many plugins start with the code like this::

    << docstring >>
    << imports >>
    << version history >>
    << globals >>

    None of these sections could be replaced by methods.

-   When you want to refer to a snippet of code that shares local variables with the enclosing code.
    This is surprisingly easy and safe to do, *provided* the section is used only in one place.
    `Section names`_ in such contexts can be clearer than method names.  For example::

    << init ivars for writing >>

In short, I create sections when convenient,
and convert them to functions or methods if they need to be used in several places.
.. @+node:ekr.20060111192108: *5* When is deleting a node dangerous?
A **dangerous** delete is a deletion of a node so that all the data in the node
is deleted *everywhere* in an outline. The data is gone, to be retrieved only
via undo or via backups. It may not be obvious which deletes are dangerous in an
outline containing clones. Happily, there is a very simple rule of thumb::

    Deleting a non-cloned node is *always* dangerous.
    Deleting a cloned node is *never* dangerous.

We could also consider a delete to be dangerous **if it results in a node being
omitted from an external file.** This can happen as follows. Suppose we have the
following outline (As usual, A' indicates that A is marked with a clone mark)::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
            - B
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B

Now suppose we clone B, and move the clone so the tree looks like this::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
            - B'
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B'
        - B'

If (maybe much later), we eliminate B' as a child of A will get::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
    - Projects
        - A'
        - B

B has not been destroyed, but B is gone from @thin spam.py! So in this sense deleting a clone node can also be called dangerous.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.12: *3* How should I use Leo with bzr/git/hg/svn/cvs?
Using @thin trees can eliminate most problems with using Leo in cooperative
(SCCS) environments:

- Developers should use @thin trees to create external files in any kind of
  cooperative environment.

- If sentinels are frowned upon in your development community, use @auto or
  @shadow instead of @thin.

- The repository contains **reference** .leo files. These reference files should
  contain nothing but @thin nodes. Reference files should change only when
  new external files get added to the project. Leo's `bzr repository`_ and Leo
  distributions contain the following reference files: LeoPyRef.leo,
  LeoPluginsRef.leo and leoGuiPluginsRef.leo. Developers should use
  local copies of reference files for their own work. For example, instead of
  using LeoPyRef.leo directly, I use a copy called LeoPy.leo.
.. @+node:ekr.20090706042206.14718: *3* How can I use Leo cooperatively without sentinels?
Leo's sentinels add outline structure to source files.
However, those sentinels annoy some people who don't use Leo.

You can use @auto, @shadow or @nosent trees to edit
files that are shared with those who don't want to see sentinel comments.

- @auto is best for files whose imported outline structure often changes. In
  most cases, this will be the best option. The drawback of @auto files are a)
  you can't use clones and b) you can't add your own organizer nodes.

- @shadow will work for files whose outline structure seldom changes.
  The advantage of @shadow is that you can add your own structure.

- @nosent is appropriate only for files that you alone modify.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.13: *3* Using external files
.. @+node:ekr.20090501093330.3: *4* @rst-option show-sections = False
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.14: *5* How do I inhibit sentinels in external files?
You have two options, depending on whether you want to be able to use sections
or not.

-   Use @nosent trees.
    Files derived from @nosent trees contain no sentinels_.
    However, Leo create the external file just as in @thin trees.
    In particular, Leo expands section references and understands the @others directive.

-   Use @asis trees.
    Files derived from @asis trees contain no sentinels_.
    Moreover, Leo does not expand section references in asis trees.
    In other words, Leo creates the `external file` simply by writing all body text in outline order.
    Leo can't update the outline unless the external file contains sentinels,
    so Leo does not update @nosent trees or @asis trees automatically when
    you change the external file in an external editor.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.16: *5* How do I prevent Leo from expanding sections?
Use @asis trees. Files derived from @asis trees contain no sentinels. Leo
creates the external file simply by writing all body text in outline order. Leo
can't update the outline unless the external file contains sentinels, so Leo
does not update @asis trees automatically when you change the external file in
an external editor.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.18: *5* How can I create Javascript comments?
**Question**: I'm writing a Windows Script Component, which is an XML file with
a CData section containing javascript. I can get the XML as I want it by using
\@language html, but how can I get the tangling comments inside the CData
section to be java-style comments rather than html ones?

**Answer**: In @thin trees you use the @delims directive to change comment delimiters.
For example::

    @delims /* */ 
    Javascript stuff 
    @delims <-- --> 
    HTML stuff

**Important**: Leo can not revert to previous delimiters automatically;
you must change back to previous delimiters using another @delims directive_.

In @root trees you can work around this problem using the @silent directive_.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.19: *5* How can I disable PHP comments?
By Zvi Boshernitzan: I was having trouble disabling '<?php' with comments (and
couldn't override the comment character for the start of the page). Finally, I
found a solution that worked, using php's heredoc string syntax::

    @first <?php
    @first $comment = <<<EOD
    EOD;

    // php code goes here.
    echo "boogie";

    $comment2 = <<<EOD
    @last EOD;
    @last ?>

or::

    @first <?php
    @first /*
    */

    echo "hi";

    @delims /* */
    @last ?>
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.20: *5* How can I use Leo with unsupported languages?
Here is a posting which might be helpful:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2300457 The @first
directive_ is the key to output usable code in unsupported languages. For
example, to use Leo with the Basic language, use the following::

    @first $IFDEF LEOHEADER
    @delims '
    @c
    $ENDIF

So this would enable a basic compiler to "jump" over the "true" LEO-header-lines.
Like this::

    $IFDEF LEOHEADER <-conditional compilation directive 
    #@+leo-ver=4 <-these lines not compiled
    #@+node:@file QParser005.INC
    #@@first
    #@delims ' 
    '@@c
    $ENDIF <-... Until here!
    <rest of derived code file ... >

This changes the comment symbol the apostrophe,
making comments parseable by a BASIC (or other language.)
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.21: *5* How do I make external files start with a shebang line?
Use the @first directive_ in @thin trees or @nosent trees.
Use the @silent directive in @root trees.

The @first directive puts lines at the very start of files derived from @thin.
For example, the body text of @thin spam.py might be::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python

The body text of @thin foo.pl might be::

    @first #/usr/bin/perl

Leo recognizes the @first directive_ only at the start of the body text of @thin nodes.
No text may precede @first directives_.
More than one @first directive may exist, like this::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python
    @first # more comments.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.22: *5* How do I use Leo to create CWEB files?
Leo has good support for `CWEB`_.
@thin trees can organize any part of CWEB code using *noweb* sections.
You can also use @asis or @nosent trees to create cweb files.
See `CWEB mode`_ for full details.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.24: *5* Can @file trees contain material not in the external file?
No. Everything in an @thin trees must be part of the external file: orphan and
\@ignore nodes are invalid in @thin trees. This restriction should not be
troublesome. For example, you can organize your outline like this::

    + myClass
    ..+ ignored stuff
    ..+ @file myClass

(As usual, + denotes a headline.) So you simply create a new node_, called
myClass, that holds your @thin trees and stuff you don't want in the @thin
trees.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.25: *5* How can I use Leo with older C compilers
By Rich Ries.
Some older C compilers don't understand the "//" comment symbol, so using @language C won't work.
Moreover, the following does not always work either::

    @comment /* */

This generates the following sentinel line::

    /*@@comment /* */*/

in the output file, and not all C compilers allow nested comments, so the last \*\/ generates an error.
The solution is to use::

    #if 0
    @comment /* */
    #endif

Leo is happy: it recognizes the @comment directive_.
The C compiler is happy: the C preprocessor strips out the offending line before the C
compiler gets it.
.. @+node:ekr.20060529053407: *5* Why can't I use @ignore directives in @thin trees?
@ignore can only be used in the root node of @thin trees.  It tells Leo to ignore the tree.

The @ignore directive can not be used elsewhere in @thin trees because of the way Leo recreates 
outlines from external files. This is an absolutely crucial restriction and will never go away.
For a few more details, see `Leo 4.0: Eliminating error 'recovery'`_ in `Chapter 9: History of Leo`_.

There are several workaround, as shown in LeoPy.leo:

- keep notes in the outline outside of any external file.

- Use @all to gather notes in a external file, as in done in @thin leoProjects.txt.
.. @+node:shadow.20080825171547.9: *5* How can I avoid getting long lines in external files?
**Question**: I must follow a coding standard when writing source code. It
includes a maximum line length restriction. How can I know the length of a
line when it gets written to the external file?

**Answer**: If a node belongs to a external file hierarchy, its body might get
indented when it is written to the external file. It happens when an
\@others directive or a section name appears indented in a higher-level
node body. While (**line**, **col**) in status area show the line and column
containing the body text's cursor, **fcol** shows the cursor coordinate
relative to the external file, not to the curent node. The relation
**fcol >= col** is always true.

See the instructions are in LeoPy.leo in::

    Notes:How To:How to add support for a new language section.

This section contains clones of all relevant parts of Leo that you will change.
Coming in Leo 4.4: Leo will use JEdit's language description files to drive the
syntax colorer. To add support for a new language, just add another such
description file.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.30: *5* How do I submit a plugin?
You have two options: 

-   Get cvs write access, and add the @thin file to the plugins directory.

-   Just send the @thin file to me at edreamleo@gmail.com.
    That's all you need to do.  In particular that there is no need to change leoPlugins.leo.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830120844: *5* How do I add a new menu item from a plugin?
c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable will append items to the end of an existing menu.
For example, the following script will add a new item at the end of the 'File' menu::

    def callback(*args,**keys):
        g.trace()

    table = (("Test1",None,callback),)

    c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable('File',table)

Plugins can do anything that can be done with Tk using the menu returned by
c.frame.menu.getMenu. For example, here is a script that adds a Test menu item
after the 'Open With' menu item in the File menu::

    def callback(*args,**keys):

.. @+node:ekr.20060805094325: *5* How can I use Leo's legacy key bindings?
You can 'revert' to old key bindings as follows:

1. Open leoSettings.leo.

2. Find the node 'Keyboard shortcuts'.

3. Disable the old bindings by moving the node
   '@keys EKR bindings: Emacs keys + modes'
   so that it is a child of the node:
   '@ignore Unused key bindings'.

4. Notice that there are two child nodes of the node
   '@ignore Unused key bindings'
   that refer to legacy key bindings:

   - '@keys Legacy Leo shortcuts with important Emacs bindings'

   - '@keys Legacy Leo bindings'.

5. Move **one** of these two legacy nodes up one level so that it is a child of the node
   'Keyboard shortcuts'.
   It should **not** be a child of the node
   '@ignore Unused key bindings'.
.. @+node:ekr.20060915112109: *5* How can I enable and disable support for psyco?
Find the @thin leoApp.py node in leoPy.leo.

You will find this ctor in the node::

    Code-->Core classes...-->@thin leoApp.py-->app.__init__

Note that this ivar can not be set using settings in leoSettings.leo because
Leo uses g.app.use_psyco before processing configuration settings.

.. @+node:ekr.20080527063511.1: *5* What is an easy way to profile code?
I had a need to figure out why a part of some python code I had written
was taking too long.

I pulled the code into LEO and the relevant part of the outline looked
something like this::

    + Main module
    -- Generate cryptographic key
    -- Hashing algorithm

etc. So I cloned just the segment I wanted to profile and pulled it under a new
section::

    + Main module
    -- [clone] Generate cryptographic key
    -- Hashing algorithm

    + Profiling Experiment
    -- [clone] Generate cryptographic key

And in the body of the "Profiling experiment", I used this code::

    code_under_here = """
    @others
    """

    from timeit import Timer
    t = Timer("print my_key_generator()", code_under_here)
    print t.timeit(number = 10)

And then I hit Control-B to execute the Profiling Experiment body. This
let me make adjustments to the code in the clone body and keep hitting
Control-B to execute the code with the timeit module to see immediately
if what I had done was making a difference.

The great thing about this was that I just used the LEO @others construct
to create a wrapper around the code and did not need to litter my code
with debug or profiling statements.  -- Kayvan
.. @+node:ekr.20070622185234: *5* How can I do a simple find and replace?
The 'official' way to start a replace command is::

    <Ctrl-shift-r>find-pattern<return>replace-text<return>

But suppose you with start with::

    <ctrl-f>find-pattern

and then realize you want to do a replace instead of a find.
No problem.  The following also works::

    <Ctrl-f>find-pattern<Ctrl-shift-r>replace-text<return>

In other words, you can think of `<ctrl-f>` as meaning 'show the find dialog'.
There is another trick you should know.
After typing `<ctrl-f>` or `<shift-ctrl-r>` you can use `<alt-ctrl>` keys to set or clear find options.
For example::

    <ctrl-f><alt-ctrl-w><find-pattern><return>

That is, `<ctrl-f>`shows the find dialog,
`<alt-ctrl-w>` toggles the Whole Word checkbox and
`<return>` starts the search.
You can type the `<alt-ctrl>` keys anytime after `<ctrl-f>` (or `<shift-ctrl-r>`) and before `<return>`. 
You can also type multiple `<alt-ctrl-keys>` to toggle multiple checkboxes.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830120857: *5* How can I use Leo to develop Leo itself?
The trick is to create a workflow that separates editing from testing. Putting
test code in LeoPy.leo would waste a lot of time. To run tests you would
have to exit Leo and reload LeoPy.leo. A much quicker way is to put all test
code in a test.leo file. So to change and test code, do the following:

1. Save LeoPy.leo but do **not** exit Leo. 

2. Quit the copy of Leo running test.leo, then reload test.leo.

3. Run test scripts from test.leo.

That's all. Python will recompile any changed .py files in the new copy of Leo.
**Note**: I create a batch file called t.bat that runs test.leo, so to the
"edit-reload-test" cycle is just:

1. Control-S (in LeoPy.leo: saves the .leo file)
2. t         (in a console window: runs test.leo, compiling all changed .py files as a side effect)
3. Control-E (in test.leo: runs the test script)

The benefits of the new workflow:

- test.leo loads  _much_ more quickly than LeoPy.leo does.
  This new approach can increase the speed of the edit-reload-test cycle by more than a factor of 10.
  Hitting Control-S, t, Control-E takes about 5 seconds.

- LeoPy.leo runs with the *old* code,
  so it is much easier to fix syntax errors or exceptions in the *new* code:
  just fix the problem and save LeoPy.leo *without* closing LeoPy.leo,
  then restart test.leo.
  You run your tests on the new code, but you edit the new code with the old, stable code.

- test.leo is the perfect place to develop test.
  I can create and organize those tests and when I am done, ''test.leo'' is a log of my work.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.74: *5* How can I import many files at once?
The Import Files dialog allows you to select multiple files provided you are running Python 2.3 or above.
There is also an importFiles script in LeoPy.leo.  You can use that script as follows::

    import leo.core.leoImport as leoImport
    leoImport.importFiles(aDirectory, ".py")

This will import all .py files from aDirectory, which should be a full path to a particular directory.
You could use ".c" to import all .c files, etc.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.119: *5* How can I use two copies of Leo to advantage?
By Rich Ries.
I often rework C code that's already been "Leo-ized"--the first pass was quick
and dirty to get it going. When I do subsequent passes, I wind up with subnodes
that are out of order with the sequence found in the main node_. It's not a big
deal, but I like 'em ordered. With just one editor pane, clicking on the node_ to
move would switch focus to that node_. I'd then need to re-focus on the main
node_. A minor nuisance, but it does slow you down.

My solution is to open a second editor with its focus on the main node_. Switch
to the other editor, and, referring to the first editor pane, move the nodes as
you like. The second editor's pane will change focus to the node_ you're moving,
but the first editor will stay focused on the main node_. It's a lot easier to
do than to describe!
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.120: *5* How can I display graphics in Leo?
One way is to link directly to the media file from a Leo node_ (with @url)
and write a scriptbutton to wrap all URL-nodes under the current node_ in a
single HTML page (using the HTML browser trick at
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1201579&forum_id=10226).

Then, you can view your media in two ways:

-   Individually. You can directly click on the @url link to display the media
    in the browser (assuming you have your MIME/filetype associations set up
    correctly for your browser).

-   In a group. You can click on a script button (you have to code this yourself,
    very simple) which should collect all @url nodes_ under the current node_
    and dynamically generate a HTML page displaying either links to or embedded
    versions of the media (using the HTML trick described above to invoke the
    browser). This way, you can create collections of @url nodes under a
    single node_ (like a bookmark folder), and press a single button to view the
    @url collection as a single entity in the browser (with all browser
    capabilities like displaying the media).

You could probably generalize this idea of "collect all @url nodes under current
node_ and display as HTML in browser" into a general-purpose plugin. However,
the plugin would have to be somewhat smart in mapping a link to its corresponding
HTML code (e.g. an image link gets mapped to an <img> HTML tag, a link to a
Flash file gets mapped to an <embed> tag, etc).
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.113: *5* How can I create a template .leo file?
**Question**:
It would be nice if Leo could open empty files. I tend to be "document oriented"
rather than "application oriented" in my thinking and prefer "create empty file
at location -> open it with program" to "start program -> create new file ->
save it at location".

**Answer** by Paul Paterson:
If you are on Windows 98/2000/XP then the procedure is as follows...

1. Start Leo
2. Click New
3. Click Save as...
4. Save the file as "c:\\windows\\shellnew\\leofile.leo" (or c:\\winnt for 2000/XP)
5. Open regedit "start...run...regedit"
6. Open HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and find the ".leo" extension type
7. Go New ... Key from the context menu 
8. Call the new key ShellNew 
9. Select the new key, right-click, choose New...String Value from the context menu
10. Call it FileName 
11. Double-click on the string, and modify it to be the filename of the leofile.leo file you created,
    including the extension
12. Exit the registry editor and restart Windows Explorer (you may need to reboot on Windows 98)

Now you should have a New:Leo File option in Explorer. This creates a duplicate
of the file you saved. This can be useful because you could make a template Leo
file containing some standard nodes_ that you always have and then save this.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.116: *5* How can I show Leo files with Excel?
From: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3240374
Using Leo's File-Export-Flatten Outline commands creates a MORE style outline which places
all Leo body sections on the left margin.
The headlines_ are indented with tabs which Excel will read as a tab delimited format.
Once inside Excel there are benefits.

1.  The most obvious benefit inside Excel is that the body sections (Excel first
    column) can be selected easily and highlighted with a different font color.
    This makes the MORE format very readable. Save a copy of your sheet as HTML
    and now you have a web page with the body sections highlighted.

2.  It is possible to hide columns in Excel.
    Hiding the first column leaves just the headlines showing.

3.  Formulas based on searching for a string can do calculations in Excel.
    For example if a heading "Current Assets" appears on level 4 then the body formula::

        =INDEX(A:A,MATCH("Current Assets",D:D,0)+1)

    will retrieve it. The +1 after match looks down one row below the matched
    headline. The trick is to place all your headlines in quotes because Excel
    will see + "Current Assets" from the MORE outline. When Excel tries
    without the quotes it thinks it is a range name and displays a #N/A
    error instead of the headline. Also you must place a child node_ below to
    get the + sign instead of a - sign which would give a MORE headline of
    -"Current assets" , also is an error.

I think there is some interesting possibility here because of the enforcement of
Leo body text being always in the first column. The Leo outline provides
additional reference to organizing the problem not typical of spreadsheet
models. Beyond scripting in Python, Excel is good at doing interrelated
calculations and detecting problems like circular references. In Excel
Tools-Options-General is a setting for r1c1 format which then shows numbers
instead of letters for column references. Using this would allow entries like
this in the leo body::

    1000
    3500
    =R[-1]C+R[-2]C

In Excel you would see 4500 below those two numbers. This is completely
independent of where the block of three cells exists on the sheet.

By Rich Ries

There is no direct way to make script buttons available in multiple Leo files.
Sure, you could copy and paste the @button nodes, but there is a slightly
easier way using the "New Buttons" plugin.

1) Create and test and debug your desired Script Button.

2) With the Script Button node selected, run Plugins --> New buttons --> Make Template From

Open a new Leo file.

3) Assuming you have only the one New Button Template defined, left-click the
   New button, and a new node will be added to your outline. (Otherwise, you'll
   need to select the Template you want.)

4) Press [Script Button] to create the new script button.

.. @+node:ekr.20080813064908.2: *5* My old .leo files won't load using Leo 4.5 or later. What should I do?
In version 4.5, Leo changed to using a sax parser for .leo files. This can cause
problems if your .leo file contains invalid characters.
Bugs in previous versions of Leo permitted these bad characters to appear.

The sax parser complains that these characters are not valid in .xml files.
Remove these invalid characters as follows:

1. `run Leo in a console window`_, and load the .leo file.
   Near the bottom of the error message you will see a line like::

    SAXParseException: <unknown>:123:25: not well-formed (invalid token)

   This line reports a bad character at character 25 of line 123.

2. Open the .leo file in an external editor.
   The Scite editor, http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html,
   is a good choice because it clearly shows non-printing characters.
   Remove the invalid character, save the .leo file.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all invalid characters are gone.

.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.114: *5* Control-Shift backspace doesn't work.  What should I do?
By Dave Hein: The cause of the keymapping problem is a issue with the X11
keyboard mapping, not with Tk. If you have this problem on your system, issue
the command::

    xmodmap -pke 

and look in the results for the line for keycode 22. I'll bet it shows something like::

    keycode 22 = BackSpace Terminate_Server

That second token ("Terminate_Server") is what is supposed to be mapped to
Shift-Backspace. You want this second token to be either not present or to be
BackSpace. To fix this, create a file (e.g. .Xmodmap) and give it the content::

    keycode 22 = BackSpace

then run the command::

    xmodmap .Xmodmap

This fixes the problem. On my system this also disables the ability to terminate
the X server using Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace. This is because of some conflict with xdb
(xdb is the newer keyboard mapping facility in XFree86; xmodmap is the old
original X11 keyboard mapping facility). I'm still working on that. I'm also not
able to get xmodmap to make this change during X11 startup (again because of
conflicts with xdb). But I'm working on that as well.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.115: *5* Error messages from the rst3 plugin aren't helpful. What can I do?
For the most part, docutils_ does a good job of reporting errors. docutils_ prints
a message to the console and inserts an unmistakable error message in the
generated .html file.
**Important**: On Windows it is helpful to `run Leo in a console window`_.

However, in some cases, docutils_ crashes instead of properly reporting the
problem. There are several workarounds:

1.  The crashes I have seen arise from the following bug in docutils.
    **Hyperlinks in image:: markup must be lower case**.  This will work::

        .. .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: faq_

    This will **crash**::

        .. .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: FAQ_

    So avoid this crash by making sure to use lower case targets in ':target:' markup.

2.  You can change the docutils_ source slightly so that it prints a traceback when it
    crashes. (The rst3 plugin should be able to do this, but I haven't figured
    out how yet.) It's easy enough to do this:

    - Find the file core.py in top-level docutils folder.
      Typically this folder will be in Python's site-packages folder.

    - Open core.py in some editor other than Leo.

    - Find the method called report_Exceptions.

    - Insert the following lines at the very start of this method::

        print 'EKR: added traceback'
        import traceback ; traceback.print_exc()

    This will cause a traceback whenever docutils_ crashes. I have found that
    such tracebacks are generally enough to locate the general area of the
    problem. **Note**: These tracebacks go to the console window, so you should
    `run Leo in a console window`_.

3.  As a last resort, you can isolate syntax errors by reducing your input files
    until they work again, then adding sections until you get a crash. This is
    easy enough to do (when using the rst3 plugin) by change a headline 'x' to
    @rst-ignore-tree x.
.. @+node:ekr.20050906090012: *5* How can I run Leo from a console window?
Leo (and other programs) often send more detailed error messages to stderr,
the output stream that goes to the console window. In Linux and MacOS
environments, python programs normally execute with the console window visible.
On Windows, can run Leo with the console window visible by associating .leo
files with python.exe *not* pythonw.exe.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.77: *5* How can I use Python's pdb debugger with Leo?
Just `run Leo in a console window`_. At the point you want to drop into the
debugger, execute this line::

    g.pdb()

All output from pdb goes to stdout, which is the console window. It would be
good to create a subclass of pdb.Pdb that uses Leo's log pane rather than a
console window, but I haven't done that. It could be done easily enough in a
plugin...

**Important**: I recommend using g.trace instead of pdb.  For example::

    g.trace(x)

prints the name of the function or method containing the trace, and the value of
x. g.callers is often useful in combination with g.trace. g.callers(5)
returns the last 5 entries of the call stack. For example::

    g.trace(x,g.callers(5))

Used this way, g.trace shows you patterns that will be invisible using pdb.
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.17: *5* I can't write Imported files.  What's going on?

Question and answer from plumloco.

Add the equivalent of::

    import sys 
    leocore = "path/to/leo/core" 
    if leocore not in sys.path: sys.path.append(leocore) 
    import leo.core.leoBridge as leoBridge

at the head of each file that uses leoBridge.

The problem is not importing leoBridge itself but (if I use 'from leo.core') the
importing of plugins, who get a different leoGlobals from leoBridge, without
g.app etc, and so do not work if they rely on dynamic values in g.etc.

> Why can't you simply add leo/core to sys.path in sitecustomize.py?  

Putting leo/core on the python path as you suggest would put forty python modules
in the global module namespace for all python programs when I want just one.
Also, I have a safe working copy of leo and a cvs/testing version. I would wish
to test any programs against the testing version while using the working
version, but both /core directories can't be exposed at the same time.

> Do you need plugins while running from the leoBridge? 

Afraid so, at least the rst3 plugin. The solution I am using now is to place::

    sys.modules['leoGlobals'] = leoGlobals  

in leoBridge after import leo.core.leoGlobals as leoGlobals

This allows my scripts
to be portable over the several computers/platforms I need to use them on, and
makes testing scripts against multiple leo versions easy. It does mean that my
scripts are not portable to other leo users but that is not likely to be a
problem.

.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.9: *5* Some characters in external files look funny. What can I do?
Internally, Leo represents all strings as unicode. Leo translates from a
particular encoding to Unicode_ when reading .leo files or external files. Leo
translates from Unicode_ to a particular encoding when writing external files.
You may see strange looking characters if your text editor is expecting a
different encoding. The encoding used in any external file is shown in the
#@+leo sentinel line like this::

    #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

**Exception**: the encoding is UTF-8 if no -encoding= field exists.
You can also use the @encoding directive_ to set the encoding for individual external files.
If no @encoding directive_ is in effect,
Leo uses the following settings_ to translate to and from unicode:

default_derived_file_encoding
    The encoding used for external files if no @encoding directive_ is in effect.
    This setting also controls the encoding of files created by the Tangle commands.
    The default is UTF-8 (case not important).

new_leo_file_encoding
    The encoding specified in the following line of new .leo files::

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">

    The default is UTF-8 (upper case for compatibility for old versions of Leo).

tk_encoding
    The encoding that Leo uses to communicate with Tk text widgets.
    You would typically use this setting only in an emergency.
    The section called::

        << set app.tkEncoding >>

    in app.finishCreate sets this encoding as follows:

    a) using the tk_encoding setting if it exists,
    b) using locale.getpreferredencoding if it exists,
       or the equivalent code in pre-python 2.3 versions,
    c) using sys.getdefaultencoding
    d) defaulting to "utf-8"

    Neither b nor c are guaranteed to give a valid encoding in all systems,
    and Leo will ignore invalid encodings returned from b or c.
    Therefore, setting the tk_encoding setting may be needed.
.. @+node:ekr.20060917130130: *5* I get weird results when defining unicode strings in scripts.  What is going on?
Add the following to the start of your scripts::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Without this line, constructs such as::

    u = u'a-(2 unicode characters here)-z'
    u = 'a-(2 unicode characters here)-z'

will not work when executed with Leo's execute script command.
Indeed, the Execute Script command creates the script by writing the tree
containing the script to a string. This is done using Leo's write logic, and
this logic converts the unicode input to a utf-8 encoded string. So *all
non-ascii characters* get converted to their equivalent in the utf-8 encoding. 
Call these encoding <e1> and <e2>. In effect the script becomes::

    u = u'a-<e1>-<e2>-z'
    u = 'a-<e2>-<e>-z'

which is certainly *not* what the script writer intended!
Rather than defining strings using actual characters, Instead, one should use
the equivalent escape sequences. For example::

    u = u'a-\\u0233-\\u8ce2-z'
    u = 'a-\\u0233-\\u8ce2-z'
.. @+node:ekr.20050830115714.10: *5* Some characters are garbled when importing files. What can I do?
The encoding used in the file being imported doesn't match the encoding in effect for Leo.
You have two options:

- Use the @encoding directive_ in an ancestor of the node_ selected when
  doing the Import command_ to specify the encoding of file to be imported.

- Set the tk_encoding setting_ (see the previous answer) to the encoding you normally use.
.. @+node:ekr.20071026055929.1: *5* Python's print statement shows 'byte hash' for unicode characters.  What can I do?
First, you must change Python's default encoding to something other than 'ascii'.  To do this, put the following in your sitecustomize.py file in Python's Lib folder::

    import sys 
    sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8') # 'iso-8859-1' is another choice.

You must restart Python after doing this: sys.setdefaultencoding can not be called after Python starts up. 

Leo's g.es_print and g.pr functions attempts to convert incoming arguments to unicode using the default encoding.
For example, the following Leo script shows various ways of printing La Peña properly::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    import sys
    e = sys.getdefaultencoding()
    print 'encoding',e
    table = (
        'La Peña',
        unicode('La Peña','utf-8'),
        u'La Peña',
        u'La Pe\\xf1a',
    )

    for s in table:
        print type(s)
        g.es_print('g.es_print',s)
        if type(s) != type(u'a'):
            s = unicode(s,e)
        print 'print     ',s
        print 'repr(s)   ',repr(s)
