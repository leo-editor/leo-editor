https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/X9rePlT6Meg

In Python 3 there is no 'unicode' function.

- A big collapse in complexity in g.reportBadChars.
- Added an important guard in g.ue for Python 3.

@language rest

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/108

The plugin tries to create a new file inside the install path, and doesn't
have the permission.

Is there a way to configure the path of this spellpyx.txt to, say, $HOME/.leo?

@language rest

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/78

The problem was in the PythonQSyntaxHighlighter class: it does not work
*exactly* like QSyntaxHighlighter. The fix was to call w.seeInsertPoint()
in pqsh.reformat_blocks_helper.

Here is how to demonstrate the bug:

- Open leoPy.leo
- select @file ../external/PythonTidy.py
- search for print (whole word)
- The first match shows properly (it doesn't scroll).
- The second match does *not* scroll properly.
