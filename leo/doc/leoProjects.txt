All changes made to leo/modes/md.py
.. @+node:ekr.20170315103331.1: *4* #438: Tree abbreviation placeholders in headlines...
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/438
.. @+node:ekr.20170326054533.1: *4* Fixed bug in k.computeInverseBindingDict
The bug gave way too many bindings for the move-lines commands.
.. @+node:ekr.20170326113032.1: *4* Fixed bug in tab completion
ga.show_tab_list wasn't showing commands without any shortcuts!
.. @+node:ekr.20170329145930.1: *4* The pylint command now warns if pylint has not been installed
The change was to pylint.run_pylint.

This removes a major source of confusion.
.. @+node:ekr.20170330024242.1: *4* #451: refresh-from-disk selects wrong node
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/451
refresh-from-disk doesn't always restore focus to the correct node

- at.readOneAtAutoNode returns the *new* position.
- c.refreshFromDisk selects that position.
.. @+node:ekr.20170401132710.1: *4* Fixed several problems with goto-global-line
.. @+node:ekr.20170401202930.1: *4* #453: Focus jumps to body when expanding abbrev in a headline
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/453
Focus jumps to de body pane when expanding an abbreviation in a headline.

The fix was in find_place_holder. It should not set focus if no placeholder found.
.. @+node:ekr.20170402034115.1: *4* #456: replace-all is very slow
Made several changes to find.batchChange.
.. @+node:ekr.20170402035751.1: *4* #458: Chapters drop-down list is not automatically resized
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/458
Set a Qt flag in tt.createControl.
.. @+node:ekr.20170403181726.1: *4* #385: Leo doesn't remember new headlines after saves 
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/385
Leo doesn't honor new headlines when switching branches

This appears to be a caching problem. No changes needed to Leo's code.
.. @+node:ekr.20170325085907.1: *3* code
.. @+node:ekr.20170325085939.1: *4* Added better checks in v.setBodyString & v.setHeadString
.. @+node:ekr.20170331043509.1: *4* Improved @auto write code
- Removed the allow_at_auto_section switch in leoAtFile.py.

- When writing @auto files << handle line at s[i] >> in at.putBody now expands section references in @auto files *if* they are defined. Otherwise, lines containing undefined section references are written as plain code lines.
.. @+node:ekr.20170331043931.1: *4* Added gen_refs keyword arg to Importer ctor
This makes explicit which importers actually generate section reference. At present, only the javascript importer sets this arg.
.. @+node:ekr.20170325090029.1: *3* features
.. @+node:ekr.20170325090032.1: *4* Added show-color-names command
.. @+node:ekr.20170326052408.1: *4* Improved move-lines-up/down commands
These commands (bound to ctrl-up/down by default) now work at the top or bottom of the body pane. The move-lines-up command inserts a new line below the moved line/lines when the lines are at the top of the body text.  Similarly, the move-lines-down command inserts a line before the moved lines when at the bottom of the body text. Imo, this is a natural and useful.
.. @+node:ekr.20170325045838.1: *4* #448: Add abbreviations for commands
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/448

If the expansion of an abbrevitiation is a command name, that command will be executed. Alas, this isn't very useful: typing destroys selection ranges.

This took only a few lines of code in abbrev.expandAbbrev.
.. @+node:ekr.20170326091637.1: *4* Improved indent-region and unindent-region commands
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/SUnqs1_YbeI/DIv0EbtFCgAJ

The indent-region and unindent-region just move the insert point if there is no text selected.
.. @+node:ekr.20170327052423.1: *4* Improved "Write Existing File?" dialog
at.promptForDangerousWrite puts up a dialog with a clearer cancel button.
All tests pass.

- It says "Cancel (No To All)".
- Added cancelMessage keyword arg to x.promptForDangerousWrite.
- Use keyword args in LeoFrame.promptForSave and ns_do_context.
.. @+node:ekr.20170328143013.1: *4* Added --trace-focus command-line argument
.. @+node:ekr.20170331043621.1: *3* settings
.. @+node:ekr.20170330083957.1: *4* Retired @bool allow_section_references_in_at_auto
The disabled setting now contains this comment:

    **Note**: This setting has been retired for the following reasons:
    
    1. The new javascript importer *always* generate section references
    for non-trivial programs. As a result, the legacy value for this
    setting would cause the javascript importer to fail.
    
    2. The new @auto write code writes expands section references if
    they exist. Otherwise, the write code writes the line as is,
    without any complaint. As a result, there should be no problem if
    an imported code contains something that looks like a section
    reference but isn't.
