.. @+node:ekr.20160502073033.1: *4* Investigated #273: Qt Bug involving large text nodes
Only minor improvements were made.

The ultimate source of the delay when selecting large text is *not* syntax coloring,
but instead the call to self.old_w.setPlainText(self.p.b) in btw.create_widgets.

Experiments show loading "dummy" text in btw.create_widgets can lead to data loss.
There are too many paths through the selection logic to attemp to "recover"
from the failure to load the body widget initially.

Obviously, data loss is a much bigger problem than slow load times.
I am going to declare this issue not to be solvable.

The colorizer now colorizers the following properly:

@staticmethod

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/292

The new code temporarily sets c.sparse_find to False.

.. @+node:ekr.20160429063430.1: *4* Added #272: optionally delay syntax coloring
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/272

Syntax coloring happens *initially* at idle-time. pqsh.setDocument queues pqsh.delayedRehighlight to run at idle time.
.. @+node:ekr.20160429063322.1: *4* Added #275: clone-marked/copy-marked/move-marked
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/275

- Improved clone-marked-nodes and move-marked-nodes.
- Added copy-marked nodes.

Note: The move-marked-nodes command is no longer undoable.
The docstring suggests using clone-marked-nodes, followed by copy/paste.

These commands work as follows:

- They create an organizer node after c.p.
  (That's not always possible for move-marked-nodes,
  in which case the organizer node becomes the last top-level node).

- They find all marked nodes, regardless of chapter, and leave
  the presently selected chapter selected, if possible.

This allows the pylint command to work without any sitecustomize.py file.
.. @+node:ekr.20160427071821.1: *4* Wont do: #236: abbrev-write generates different continuations than used in @data
abbrev-write generates different continuations than used in @data
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/236

When defining abbreviations in a @data abbreviations node,
continuation looks like:
continue;;=line 1
: line 2
: line 3

when abbreviations are dumped via abbrev-write they look like:
continue;;=line 1\n line 2\n line 3

I would consider the abbrev-write file more useful if it used the
same continuation convention as in @data nodes
.. @+node:ekr.20160429062804.1: *4* Added #32: Add freemind and mindjet imports
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/32

The code:
https://github.com/leo-editor/snippets/tree/master/issue_attach/32

There are two ways to access these commands:

1. Using the general import-files command, via the minibuffer or the File:Import File menu.  This opens a dialog that picks the proper importer **based on the file's extension**.  mm.html files get the FreeMind importer. .csv files get the MindJet importer.

2. If these conventions don't suit you, you can use specific import-free-mind-files or import-mind-jet-files commands. These open a dialog in which the specific extension is pre-selected, but you can pick any file as usual.  In particular, it's possible to use the MindJet importer to open .ipynb files, which have .csv format.

In general, if you pick an invalid file, the importers will fail gracefully.

.. @+node:ekr.20160510132357.1: *4* Added Installer that only installs file associations
You can find it here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/5.3-final/.

It works for me on Windows 10. This completes #285.

This is useful for people who install Leo using git, or any other way except using the full Windows installer.  It creates file associations and (optionally) a desktop icon.

The installer prompts for both the already-installed Leo installation folder (leo-editor for those using git) and a top-level Python directory. Necessary for auto-launching Leo. It also asks whether you want to open Leo in a console.  On my system, pythonw.exe doesn't work for Anaconda3, so a "yes" is required.  I'll probably back-port some of these features to the full installer.
