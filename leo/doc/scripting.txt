Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python
####################################

This chapter describes how to write Python scripts that control Leo and access
the data in Leo outlines. To write such scripts, you must understand the basics
of Leo's internal data structures. As we shall see, these basics are quite simple.

Although this chapter discussses everything you will need to write most scripts,
please keep in mind that your scripts have complete access to all of Leo's
source code, that is, all the code in LeoPy.leo.

**Note**: If you are reading this documentation in leoDocs.leo you can execute
all code examples in this chapter by running the Execute Script command
(Ctrl-B). You may have to select the actual code to execute if a node contains
comments interspersed with the code.

.. @+node:ekr.20091104200540.6566: *3* @rst-ignore
.. @+node:ekr.20091107181442.26607: *4* old, too complicated intro
Leo's **vnode** classe represents all the data in a particular node.
In the simplied data model, a single vnode represents all clones on the screen.
When Leo clones a vnode v, alters data structures in v and v's parent vnode,
but Leo does *not* create another vnode to represent the clone.
Thus, the *exact same* vnode may appear in several places on Leo's outline pane.

Leo's **position** class represents a position (spot) in Leo's outline pane.
More exactly, a position represents the state of a tree traversal of Leo's data.
Vnode's may appear several times in a traversal, which is another way of saying
that vnodes may appear several times in Leo's outline pane.

Leo's **generators** generate lists of positions.
For example, c.all_positions() generates a list of all positions in the outline.
As another example, given a position p,
p.self_and_subtree() generates a list of all descendants of the vnode at position p.

Leo' **position methods** provide other ways ways of finding positions.
Given a position p, p.parent() is the p's parent position,
p.firstChild() is the position of p's first child (if it exists),
and p.next() is the position of p's next sibling (again, if it exists).
Many other position methods exist, as discussed below.

Leo's execute-script command predefines several symbols.  This makes it easy to
access the data in Leo outlines and the Leo's own source code. g is predefined
to the leoGlobals module. Scripts commonly use utility functions such as g.es,
g.trace, etc. The g.app object represents Leo itself. The instance vars (ivars)
of g.app are Leo's global variables and constants. The execute-script command
predefines c to be the commander (see below) of the Leo outline in which the
script is contained. Whenever possible, scripts should use the high-level
methods of the commander to insert, delete or clone nodes. Finally, the
execute-script commands predefines p to be the presently selected position.
.. @+node:ekr.20091104200540.6567: *4* details for later

    **Note**:
    For compatibility with old (pre-4.2) scripts, c.currentVnode and
    c.rootVnode methods return *positions* not vnodes.

**Important**: With the exception of the p.v ivar, scripts should be careful to
use only the methods of the position and vnode classes rather than the internal
ivars of these classes. Doing so will ensure that the script is as simple as
possible and that the script will continue to work regardless of future changes
to the internals of these classes.

 **Important**:
    Positions can become *invalid* when the structure of the outline changes.
    As discussed below, plugins and scripts that store positions for use at a later time should make sure the
    position p is still valid by calling c.positionExists(p)

**baseTextWidget** and its subclasses
    Leo's body pane, c.frame.body.bodyCtrl, is a subclass of baseTextWidget.
    Gui plugins implement Leo's body pane by subclassing baseTextWidget.

**frame**
    Frames contain the internal data needed to manage a Leo window. Given a
    commander c, c.frame is commander's frame. Given a frame f,
    f.c is the frame's commander.

**g.app.gui**
    This object represents gui-specific subclasses of Leo's base gui code.

.. @+node:ekr.20040403183229: *3* Leo's most import objects
Leo scripts typically use the following objects:

**g**
    The predefined constant g is the leo.core.leoGlobals module. This
    module contains several dozen utilty functions and classes.

**g.app**
    g.app is the **application object** representing the entire Leo application.
    The instance variables (ivars) of g.app represent Leo's global variables.

**commander**
    The predefined constant c is the commander of the window containing the
    script. Commanders represent all aspects of a single Leo window. For any
    commander c, c.p is the presently selected position (see below), and
    c.rootPosition() is the root (first) position in the outline. Given
    c, Leo scripts can gain access to all data present while Leo is running,
    including all of Leo's classes, functions and data.

**position**
    The predefined constant p is the position of the presently selected
    node. Positions represent locations in Leo outlines. For any position p,
    p.v is the vnode at that position.

**vnode**
    A vnode represents a single outline node. Because of clones, a vnode may
    appear in several places on the screen. Vnodes hold most of the data in Leo
    outlines. For any vnode v, v.h is the node's headline, and v.b
    is the node's body text. As a convenience, for any position p, p.h
    and p.b are synonyms for p.v.h and p.v.b.

Later sections will discuss other classes, objects and utility functions, but
most scripts will need only the objects and classes described above.
.. @+node:ekr.20070120075236: *3* Predefined objects
Leo's execute script command predefines the c, g and p constants
when it runs any script inside Leo:

- c is the commander of the outline containing the script.
- g is Leo's leo.core.leoGlobals module.
- p is the presently selected position, the same as c.p.

Leo scripts can use c and g to gain access to all of Leo's source code.
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.3: *3* g.es writes to the log pane
The g.es method prints its arguments to the Log tab of the log pane::

    g.es("Hello world")

g.es converts non-string arguments using repr::

    g.es(c)

g.es prints multiple arguments separated by commas::

    g.es("Hello","world")

To create a tab named 'Test' or make it visible if it already exists::

    c.frame.log.selectTab('Test')

When first created, a tab contains a Tk.Text widget.
To write to this widget, add the tabName argument to g.es::

    g.es('Test',color='blue',tabName='Test')
.. @+node:ekr.20040403175157.1: *3* app.windowList: the list of all open frames
The windowlist attribute of the application instance contains the list of the
frames of all open windows. The commands ivar of the frame gives the commander
for that frame::

    windows = g.app.windowList # get the list of all open frames.
    g.es("windows...")
    for f in windows:
        c = f.c # c is f's commander
        g.es(f)
        g.es(f.shortFileName())
        g.es(c)
        g.es(c.rootPosition())

There is also g.app.commandrs() method, that gives the list of all active
commanders directly.
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.6: *3* Getting and setting headline and body text
Here is how to access the data of a Leo window::

    g.es(p) # p is already defined.
    p = c.p # get the current position.
    g.es(p)
    g.es("head:",p.h)
    g.es("body:",p.b)

Here is how to access data at position p.
**Note**: these methods work whether or not p is the current position::

    body = p.b # get the body text.
    head = p.h # get the headline text.
    p.b = body # set body text of p to body.
    p.h = head # set headline text of p to head.

**Note**: Sometimes you want to use text that *looks* like a section reference, but isn't.
In such cases, you can use g.angleBrackets.  For example::

    g.es(g.angleBrackets('abc'))
.. @+node:ekr.20090223065025.3: *3* Getting and setting body text directly
Let::

    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl # Leo's body pane.

Scripts can get or change the context of the body as follows::

    w.appendText(s)                     # Append s to end of body text.
    w.delete(i,j=None)                  # Delete characters from i to j.
    w.deleteTextSelection()             # Delete the selected text, if any.
    s = w.get(i,j=None)                 # Return the text from i to j.
    s = w.getAllText                    # Return the entire body text.
    i = w.getInsertPoint()              # Return the location of the cursor.
    s = w.getSelectedText()             # Return the selected text, if any.
    i,j = w.getSelectionRange (sort=True) # Return the range of selected text.
    w.replace(i,j,s)                    # Replace the text from i to j by s.
    w.setAllText(s)                     # Set the entire body text to s.
    w.setBackgroundColor(color)         # Set the background color.
    w.setSelectionRange(i,j,insert=None) # Select the text.
    w.setForegroundColor(color)         # Set the foreground color.

**Notes**:

- These are only the most commonly-used methods.
  For more information, consult Leo's source code.

- i and j are zero-based indices into the the text.
  When j is not specified, it defaults to i.
  When the sort parameter is in effect, getSelectionRange
  ensures i <= j.

- color is a tk color name, even when using the qt gui plugin.
.. @+node:ekr.20070122093626: *3* Ensuring that positions are valid
Positions become invalid whenever the outline changes. Plugins and scripts that
can make sure the position p is still valid by calling c.positionExists(p).

The following code will find a position p2 having the same vnode as p::

    if not c.positionExists(p):
        for p2 in c.all_positions():
            if p2.v == p.v: # found
                c.selectPosition(p2)
        else:
            print('position no longer exists')
.. @+node:ekr.20050902073404: *3* About copying positions
Scripts must wary of saving positions because positions become invalid
whenever the user moves, inserts or deletes nodes.  It is valid to store
positions **only** when a script knows that the stored position will be used
before the outline's stucture changes.

To store a postion, the script must use the p.copy() method::

    p2 = p.copy()   # Correct: p2 will not change when p changes later.

The following **will not work**::

    p2 = p  # Wrong.  p2 will change if p changes later.

For example, the following creates a dictionary of saved positions::

    d = {}
    for p in c.all_positions():
        d[p.v] = p.copy()

.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.9: *3* Traversing outlines
Leo scripts can easily access any node of an outline with generators. Leo's
generators return positions or nodes, one after another. Generators do not
return lists, but you can make lists from generators easily. For example, the
c.all_positions() generator returns every position in c's tree, one after
another. You can use the generator directly, like this::

    for p  in c.all_positions():
        print(p.h)

You can create actual lists from generators in several ways::

    aList = list(c.all_positions()] # Use the list built-in function.
    print(aList)

or::

    aList = [p.copy() for p in c.all_positions()] # Use list comprehension.
    print(aList)


Using the list is simpler, but list comprehensions can be more flexible.  For example::

    aList = [p.copy().h for p in c.all_positions() if p.h.startswith('@thin')]
    print(aList)
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.10: *4* c.all_positions & c.all_unique_positions
The c.all_positions generator returns a list of all positions in the outline.
This script makes a list of all the nodes in an outline::

    nodes = list(c.all_positions())
    print("This outline contains %d nodes" % len(nodes))

The c.all_unique_positions generator returns a list of all unique positions in the outline.
For each vnode v in the outline, exactly one position p is returned such that p.v == v.

This script prints the *distinct* vnodes of an outline::

    for p in c.all_unique_positions():
        sep = g.choose(p.hasChildren(),'+','-')
        print('%s%s %s' % (' '*p.level(),sep,p.h))
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.13: *4* p.children
The p.children generator returns a list of all children of position p::

    parent = p.parent()
    print("children of %s" % parent.h)
    for p in parent.children():
        print(p.h)
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.14: *4* p.parents & p.self_and_parents
The p.parents generator returns a list of all parents of position p,
excluding p::

    current = p.copy()
    print("exclusive of %s" % (current.h),color="purple")
    for p in current.parents():
        print(p.h)

The p.self_and_parents generator returns a list of all parents of position
p, including p::

    current = p.copy()
    print("inclusive parents of %s" % (current.h),color="purple")
    for p in current.self_and_parents():
        print(p.h)    
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.15: *4* p.siblings & p.following_siblings
The p.siblings generator returns a list of all siblings of position p::

    current = c.p
    print("all siblings of %s" % (current.h),color="purple")
    for p in current.self_and_siblings():
        print(p.h)

The p.following_siblings generator returns a list of all siblings that
follow position p::

    current = c.p
    print("following siblings of %s" % (current.h),color="purple")
    for p in current.following_siblings():
        print(p.h)
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.16: *4* p.subtree & p.self_and_subtree
The p.subtree generator returns a list of all positions in p's subtree, excluding p::

    parent = p.parent()
    print("exclusive subtree of %s" % (parent.h),color="purple")
    for p in parent.subtree():
        print(p.h)

The p.self_and_subtree generator returns a list of all positions in p's subtree, including p::

    parent = p.parent()
    print("inclusive subtree of %s" % (parent.h),color="purple")
    for p in parent.self_and_subtree():
        print(p.h)
.. @+node:ekr.20040903100514: *4* Testing whether a position is valid
The tests::

    if p:       # Right
    if not p:   # Right

are the **only** correct ways to test whether a position p is valid.
In particular, the following **will not work**::

    if p is None:       # Wrong
    if p is not None:   # Wrong
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.17: *3* Updating the screen
You can use c.redraw_now to redraw the entire screen immediately::

    c.redraw_now()

However, it is usually better to *request* a redraw to be done later as follows::

    c.redraw()

Leo actually redraws the screen in c.outerUpdate, provided that a redraw has been requested.
Leo will call c.outerUpdate at the end of each script, event handler and Leo command.
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.18: *3* Invoking commands from scripts
Leo dispatches commands using c.doCommand,
which calls the "command1" and "command2" hook routines for the given label.
c.doCommand catches all exceptions thrown by the command::

    c.doCommand(c.markHeadline,label="markheadline")

You can also call command handlers directly so that hooks will not be called::

    c.markHeadline()

You can invoke minibuffer commands by name.  For example::

    c.executeMinibufferCommand('open-outline')

c.keyHandler.funcReturn contains the value returned from the command.
In many cases, as above, this value is simply 'break'.
.. @+node:ekr.20050907094633: *3* Getting settings from @settings trees
Any .leo file may contain an @settings tree, so settings may be different for each commander.
Plugins and other scripts can get the value of settings as follows::

    format_headlines = c.config.getBool('rst3_format_headlines')
    print('format_headlines',format_headlines)

The c.config class has the following getters.
See the configSettings in leoCommands.py for details::

    c.config.getBool(settingName,default=None)
    c.config.getColor(settingName)
    c.config.getDirectory(settingName)
    c.config.getFloat(settingName)
    c.config.getInt(settingName)
    c.config.getLanguage(settingName)
    c.config.getRatio(settingName)
    c.config.getShortcut(settingName)
    c.config.getString(settingName)

These methods return None if no setting exists.
The getBool 'default' argument to getBool gives the value to be returned if the setting does not exist.

You can set any *existing* item in an @settings tree with c.config.set(p,setting,val).
For example::

    for val in (False,True):
        c.config.set(p,'rst3_format_headlines',val)
        format_headlines = c.config.getBool('rst3_format_headlines')
        print('format_headlines',format_headlines)

c.config.set does not change the @settings tree; it simply changes the values returned by the getters.
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.19: *3* Getting and setting preferences
Each commander maintains its own preferences.
Your scripts can get the following ivars::

    ivars = (
        'output_doc_flag',
        'page_width',
        'page_width',
        'tab_width',
        'tangle_batch_flag',
        'tangle_directory',
        'target_language',
        'untangle_batch_flag',
        'use_header_flag',
    )

    print("Prefs ivars...\n",color="purple")
    for ivar in ivars:
        print(getattr(c,ivar))

If your script sets c.tab_width your script may call f.setTabWidth to redraw the screen::

    c.tab_width = -4    # Change this and see what happens.
    c.frame.setTabWidth(c.tab_width)
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.21: *3* Functions for finding and changing text from scripts
The file leoFindScript.py contains functions for finding and changing text
from within scripts.  See leoFindScript.py in LeoPy.leo for full details.

The findall function returns a list of tuples (v,pos) describing matches in
c's entire tree::

    import leo.scripts.leoFindScript as leoFindScript

    pattern="import leo.core.leoGlobals as g"
    result = leoFindScript.findAll(c,pattern,bodyFlag=1)

    print("%-3d instances of: '%s'...\n" % (len(result),pattern),color="purple")

    for v,pos in result:
        body = v.b
        print('\n%-4d %s' % (pos,v.h))
        print(g.get_line_after(body,pos))

The reFindall function returns a list of tuples (v,mo,pos), where mo
is a MatchObject. The reFlags argument are flags to re.search::

    import leo.scripts.leoFindScript as leoFindScript

    pattern="from .* import"
    result = leoFindScript.reFindAll(c,pattern,bodyFlag=1,reFlags=None)

    print("%-3d instances of: '%s'...\n" % (len(result),pattern),color="purple")
    for v,mo,pos in result:
        body = v.b
        print('\n%-4d %s' % (pos,v.h))
        print(g.get_line_after(body,pos))
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.25: *3* Functions defined in leoGlobals.py
leoGlobals.py contains many utility functions and constants.
The following script prints all the names defined in leoGlobals.py::

    print("Names defined in leoGlobals.py",color="purple")
    names = g.__dict__.keys()
    names.sort()
    for name in names:
        print(name)
.. @+node:ekr.20050903074833: *3* Event handlers
Plugins and other scripts can register event handlers (also known as hooks) with code such as::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("after-create-leo-frame",onCreate)
    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle) 
    leoPlugins.registerHandler(("start2","open2","command2"), create_open_with_menu) 

As shown above, a plugin may register one or more event handlers with a single call to
leoPlugins.registerHandler. Once a hook is registered, Leo will call the
registered function' at the named **hook time**. For example::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle)

causes Leo to call on_idle at "idle" time.

Event handlers must have the following signature::

    def myHook (tag, keywords):
        whatever

-   tag is the name of the hook (a string).
-   keywords is a Python dictionary containing additional information.
    The following section describes the contents of the keywords dictionary in detail.

**Important**: hooks should get the proper commander this way::

    c = keywords.get('c')
.. @+node:ekr.20050903074833.1: *4* @rst-no-head Summary of event handlers
The following table tells about each event handler: its name, when it is called,
and the additional arguments passed to the hook in the keywords dictionary.
For some kind of hooks, Leo will skip its own normal processing if the hook
returns anything *other* than None. The table indicates such hooks with 'yes' in
the 'Stop?' column.

**Important**: Ever since Leo 4.2, the v, old_v and new_v keys in
the keyword dictionary contain *positions*, not vnodes. These keys are
deprecated. The new_c key is also deprecated. Plugins should use the c key instead.

============================= ======== =================================== =============================

**Notes**:

1.  'activate' and 'deactivate' hooks have been removed because they do not work as expected.

2.  'commands' hooks: The label entry in the keywords dict contains the
    'canonicalized' form of the command, that is, the lowercase name of the command
    with all non-alphabetic characters removed.
    Commands hooks now set the label for undo and redo commands 'undo' and 'redo'
    rather than 'cantundo' and 'cantredo'.

3.  'menu1' hook: Setting g.app.realMenuNameDict in this hook is an easy way of
    translating menu names to other languages. **Note**: the 'new' names created this
    way affect only the actual spelling of the menu items, they do *not* affect how
    you specify shortcuts settings, nor do they affect the 'official'
    command names passed in g.app.commandName. For example::

        app().realMenuNameDict['Open...'] = 'Ouvre'.

4.  'open1' and 'open2' hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing the following entries:

    - c:          The commander of the newly opened window.
    - old_c:      The commander of the previously open window.
    - new_c:      (deprecated: use 'c' instead) The commander of the newly opened window.
    - fileName:   The name of the file being opened.

    You can use old_c.p and c.p to get the current position in the old and new windows.
    Leo calls the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks only if the file is not already open. Leo
    will also call the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks if: a) a file is opened using the
    Recent Files menu and b) the file is not already open.

5.  '\@url1' and '\@url2' hooks are only executed if the 'icondclick1' hook returns None.

6.  These hooks are useful for testing.

7.  These hooks allow plugins to parse and handle markup within doc parts,
    comments and Python ''' strings. Note that these hooks are *not* called in
    Python ''' strings. See the color_markup plugin for a complete example of how to
    use these hooks.

8.  Leo calls the 'create-optional-menus' hook when creating menus. This hook need
    only create new menus in the correct order, without worrying about the placement
    of the menus in the menu bar. See the plugins_menu and scripts_menu plugins for
    examples of how to use this hook.

9.  The New command calls 'new'.
    The 'new_c' key is deprecated.  Use the 'c' key instead.

10. g.scanDirectives calls 'scan-directives' hook.
    g.scanDirectives returns a dictionary, say d.
    d.get('pluginsList') is an a list of tuples (d,v,s,k) where:

    - d is the spelling of the @directive, without the leading @.
    - v is the vnode containing the directive, _not_ the original vnode.
    - s[k:] is a string containing whatever follows the @directive.
      k has already been moved past any whitespace that follows the @directive.

    See the add_directives plugins directive for a complete example of how to use
    the 'scan-directives' hook.

11. g.app.closeLeoWindow calls the 'close-frame' hook just before
    removing the window from g.app.windowList. The hook code may remove the window
    from app.windowList to prevent g.app.closeLeoWindow from destroying the window.

12. g.app.destroyAllGlobalWindows calls the 'destroy-all-global-windows' hook.
    This hook gives plugins the chance to clean up after themselves when Leo shuts down.

13. Leo calls the 'headkey1' and 'headkey2' when the headline *might* have changed.

14. p is the new node (position) containing '@auto filename.ext'
.. @+node:ekr.20071021102946: *4* Enabling idle time event handlers
Two methods in leoGlobals.py allow scripts and plugins to enable and disable 'idle' events.
**g.enableIdleTimeHook(idleTimeDelay=100)** enables the "idle" hook.
Afterwards, Leo will call the "idle" hook approximately every idleTimeDelay milliseconds.
Leo will continue to call the "idle" hook periodically until disableIdleTimeHook is called.
**g.disableIdleTimeHook()** disables the "idle" hook.
.. @+node:ekr.20050417072710.1: *3* How to make operations undoable
Plugins and scripts should call u.beforeX and u.afterX methods ato
describe the operation that is being performed. **Note**: u is shorthand for
c.undoer. Most u.beforeX methods return undoData that the client
code merely passes to the corresponding u.afterX method. This data contains
the 'before' snapshot. The u.afterX methods then create a bead containing
both the 'before' and 'after' snapshots.

u.beforeChangeGroup and u.afterChangeGroup allow multiple calls to
u.beforeX and u.afterX methods to be treated as a single undoable entry.
See the code for the Change All, Sort, Promote and Demote
commands for examples. The u.beforeChangeGroup and u.afterChangeGroup
methods substantially reduce the number of u.beforeX and afterX methods
needed.

Plugins and scripts may define their own u.beforeX and afterX methods. Indeed,
u.afterX merely needs to set the bunch.undoHelper and
bunch.redoHelper ivars to the methods used to undo and redo the operation.
See the code for the various u.beforeX and afterX methods for guidance.

p.setDirty and p.setAllAncestorAtFileNodesDirty now return a
dirtyVnodeList that all vnodes that became dirty as the result of an
operation. More than one list may be generated: client code is responsible for
merging lists using the pattern dirtyVnodeList.extend(dirtyVnodeList2)

See the section << How Leo implements unlimited undo >> in leoUndo.py
for more details. In general, the best way to see how to implement undo is to
see how Leo's core calls the u.beforeX and afterX methods.
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.5: *3* Redirecting output from scripts
leoGlobals.py defines 6 convenience methods for redirecting stdout and stderr::

    g.redirectStderr() # Redirect stderr to the current log pane.
    g.redirectStdout() # Redirect stdout to the current log pane.
    g.restoreStderr()  # Restores stderr so it prints to the console window.
    g.restoreStdout()  # Restores stdout so it prints to the console window.
    g.stdErrIsRedirected() # Returns True if the stderr stream is redirected to the log pane.
    g.stdOutIsRedirected() # Returns True if the stdout stream is redirected to the log pane.

Calls need *not* be paired. Redundant calls are ignored and the last call made
controls where output for each stream goes.
**Note**: you must execute Leo in a console window to see non-redirected output from the print statement::

    print("stdout isRedirected: %s" % g.stdOutIsRedirected())
    print("stderr isRedirected: %s" % g.stdErrIsRedirected())

    g.redirectStderr()
    print("stdout isRedirected: %s" % g.stdOutIsRedirected())
    print("stderr isRedirected: %s" % g.stdErrIsRedirected())

    g.redirectStdout()
    print("stdout isRedirected: %s" % g.stdOutIsRedirected())
    print("stderr isRedirected: %s" % g.stdErrIsRedirected())

    g.restoreStderr()
    print("stdout isRedirected: %s" % g.stdOutIsRedirected())
    print("stderr isRedirected: %s" % g.stdErrIsRedirected())

    g.restoreStdout()
    print("stdout isRedirected: %s" % g.stdOutIsRedirected())
    print("stderr isRedirected: %s" % g.stdErrIsRedirected())
.. @+node:ekr.20061003204952: *3* Writing to different log tabs
Plugins and scripts can create new tabs in the log panel.
The following creates a tab named test or make it visible if it already exists::

    c.frame.log.selectTab('Test')

g.es, g.enl, g.ecnl, g.ecnls write to the log tab specified by the optional
tabName argument. The default for tabName is 'Log'. The put and putnl methods of
the tkinterLog class also take an optional tabName argument which defaults to
'Log'.

Plugins and scripts may call the
c.frame.canvas.createCanvas method to create a log tab containing a Tk.Canvas
widget. Here is an example script::

    log = c.frame.log ; tag = 'my-canvas'
    w = log.canvasDict.get(tag)
    if not w:
        w = log.createCanvas(tag)
        w.configure(bg='yellow')
    log.selectTab(tag)
.. @+node:ekr.20071026183116: *3* Invoking dialogs using the g.app.gui class
Scripts can invoke various dialogs using the following methods of the g.app.gui object.
Here is a partial list. You can use typing completion(default bindings: Alt-1 and Alt-2) to get the full list!
::

    g.app.gui.runAskOkCancelNumberDialog(c,title,message)
    g.app.gui.runAskOkCancelStringDialog(c,title,message)
    g.app.gui.runAskOkDialog(c,title,message=None,text='Ok')
    g.app.gui.runAskYesNoCancelDialog(c,title,message=None,
        yesMessage='Yes',noMessage='No',defaultButton='Yes')
    g.app.gui.runAskYesNoDialog(c,title,message=None)

The values returned are in ('ok','yes','no','cancel'), as indicated by the
method names. Some dialogs also return strings or numbers, again as indicated by
their names.

Scripts can run File Open and Save dialogs with these methods::

    g.app.gui.runOpenFileDialog(title,filetypes,defaultextension,multiple=False)
    g.app.gui.runSaveFileDialog(initialfile,title,filetypes,defaultextension)

For details about how to use these file dialogs, look for examples in Leo's own
source code. The runOpenFileDialog returns a list of file names.
.. @+node:ekr.20080109074102: *3* Inserting and deleting icons
You can add an icon to the presently selected node with
c.editCommands.insertIconFromFile(path). path is an absolute path or a path
relative to the leo/Icons folder. A relative path is recommended if you plan to
use the icons on machines with different directory structures.

For example::

    path = 'rt_arrow_disabled.gif' 
    c.editCommands.insertIconFromFile(path) 

Scripts can delete icons from the presently selected node using the following methods::

    c.editCommands.deleteFirstIcon() 
    c.editCommands.deleteLastIcon() 
    c.editCommands.deleteNodeIcons() 
.. @+node:ekr.20051101171734: *3* Customizing panes with different widgets
Tk/Tkinter make it easy to customize the contents of any of Leo's panes. The
following sections will discuss the 'official' ivars that make it possible for
scripts to access and alter the contents of panes. The next three sections will
give examples of modifying each pane.
.. @+node:ekr.20061003204952.1: *4* Official ivars
The c.frame.log class contains the following 'official' ivars::

    g.es('tabName',c.frame.log.tabName)     # The name of the active tab.
    g.es('tabFrame',c.frame.log.tabFrame)   # The Tk.Frame containing all the other widgets of the tab.
    g.es('logCtrl',c.frame.log.logCtrl)     # Tk.Text widget containing the log text.

The following ivars provide access to the body pane::

    g.es('bodyFrame',c.frame.body.frame)    # The Tk.Frame widget containing the c.frame.body.bodyCtrl

The following ivars provide access to the outline pane::

    g.es('canvas',c.frame.tree.canvas) # The Tk.Canvas on which Leo's outline is drawn.

Tkinter provides a way of determining the enclosing widget of any widget.
The body text is enclosed in a Pmw.PanedWidget to support multiple editors.

    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    parent = w.pack_info().get('in') 
    g.es('bodyCtrl.parent',parent) # The Tk.Frame containing the body text.
.. @+node:ekr.20061003212136: *4* Common operations on Tk.Text widgets
The following is no substitute for a full discussion of programming the Tk.Text
widget: it can do lots.

To clear the log::

    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    w.delete('1.0','end')

To write a line to the end of the log::

    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    w.insert('end','This is a test\n')

To get the entire contents of the log::

    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    g.es(w.get('1.0','end')+'\n')
.. @+node:ekr.20061003204952.2: *4* Customizing the log pane
The following line removes the initial text widget::

    c.frame.log.logCtrl.pack_forget()

To make the text widget visible again::

    c.frame.log.logCtrl.pack(side='top',expand=1,fill='both')

Plugins and scripts can pack any other widgets into c.frame.log.tabFrame.
For example, the following replaces the default text widget with a red box::

    import Tkinter as Tk

    # Remove the old contents.
    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    parent =  w.pack_info().get('in')
    w.pack_forget()

    # Replace with a red frame.
    f = c.frame.newLog = Tk.Frame(parent,background='red')
    f.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')

And the following will restore the original pane::

    c.frame.newLog.pack_forget()
    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    w.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')
.. @+node:ekr.20061003204952.3: *4* Customizing the body pane
Warning: you will find it hard to execute scripts after removing the body pane,
so you had best make the following two scripts into script buttons before
executing them :-)

Plugins and scripts can pack any other widgets into c.frame.log.tabFrame.
For example, the following replaces the default text widget with a red box::

    import Tkinter as Tk

    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    parent =  w.pack_info().get('in')
    w.pack_forget()

    f = c.frame.newBody = Tk.Frame(parent,background='red')
    f.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')

To restore::

    c.frame.newBody.pack_forget()
    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    w.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')
.. @+node:ekr.20061003204952.4: *4* Customizing the outine pane
The following replaces the outline pane with a red frame::

    import Tkinter as Tk

    w = c.frame.tree.canvas
    parent =  w.pack_info().get('in')
    w.pack_forget()

    f = c.frame.newTree = Tk.Frame(parent,background='red')
    f.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')

And this script restores the outline::

    c.frame.newTree.pack_forget()
    c.frame.tree.canvas.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')
.. @+node:ekr.20081205084002.2: *3* Working with directives and paths
Scripts can easily determine what directives are in effect at a particular
position in an outline. c.scanAllDirectives(p) returns a Python dictionary whose
keys are directive names and whose values are the value in effect at position p.
For example::

    d = c.scanAllDirectives(p)
    g.es(g.dictToString(d))

In particular, d.get('path') returns the full, absolute path created by all
\@path directives that are in ancestors of node p. If p is any kind of @file node
(including @thin, @auto, @nosent, @shadow, etc.), the following script will
print the full path to the created file::

    path = d.get('path')
    name = p.anyAtFileNodeName()
    if name:
       name = g.os_path_finalize_join(path,name)
       g.es(name)
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.26: *3* Summary of the vnode and position classes
Most scripts will use methods of the position class to access information in an
outline. The following sections summarizes the most useful methods that your
scripts can use. For a complete list, see the leoNodes.py in of LeoPy.leo.
.. @+node:ekr.20040411151245: *4* generators
Here is the list of Leo's generators::

    c.all_nodes             # all vnodes in c.
    c.all_unique_nodes      # all unique vnodes in c.
    c.all_positions         # all positions in c.
    c.all_unique_positions  # all unique positions in c.

    p.children              # all children of p.
    p.following_siblings    # all siblings of p that follow p.
    p.nodes                 # all vnodes in p's subtree.
    p.parents               # all parents of p.
    p.self_and_parents      # p and all parents of p.
    p.siblings              # all siblings of p, including p.
    p.subtree               # all positions in p's subtree, excluding p.
    p.self_and_subtree      # all positions in p's subtree, including p.
    p.unique_nodes          # all unique vnodes in p's subtree.
    p.unique_subtree        # all unique positions in p's subtree.

**Note**: A generator that returns **unique positions** is a generator that returns
a list of positions such that p.v == v at most once for any vnode v.
Similarly, a generator that returns **unique nodes** is a generator that returns
a list that contains any vnode at most once.

**Note**: The names given above are the recommended names for Leo's generators.
Leo continues to support the names of iterators used before Leo 4.7.
These names typically end with the _iter suffix.
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.27: *4* Getters
Here are the most useful getters of the vnode and position classes.

Returning strings::

    p.b # the body string of p.
    p.h # the headline string of p. A property.

Returning ints::

    p.childIndex()
    p.numberOfChildren()
    p.level()

Returning bools representing property bits::

    p.hasChildren()
    p.isAncestorOf(v2) # True if v2 is a child, grandchild, etc. of p.
    p.isCloned()
    p.isDirty()
    p.isExpanded()
    p.isMarked()
    p.isVisible()
    p.isVisited()
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.28: *4* Setters
Here are the most useful setters of the Commands and position classes.
The following setters of the position class regardless of whether
p is the presently selected position::

    c.setBodyString(p,s)  # Sets the body text of p.
    c.setHeadString(p,s)  # Sets the headline text of p.

Moving nodes::

    p.moveAfter(v2)           # move p after v2
    p.moveToNthChildOf(v2,n)  # move p to the n'th child of v2
    p.moveToRoot(oldRoot)     # make p the root position.
                              # oldRoot must be the old root position if it exists.

The "visited" bit may be used by commands or scripts for any purpose.
Many commands use this bits for tree traversal, so these bits do not persist::

    c.clearAllVisited() # Clears all visited bits in c's tree.
    p.clearVisited()
    p.setVisited()
.. @+node:ekr.20050903161843: *3* Creating script buttons
Creating a script button should be your first thought whenever you want to
automate any task. The scripting plugin, mod_scripting.py, puts two buttons
in the icon menu, a pink Run Script button and a yellow Script Button
button. The Run Script button does the same thing as the Execute Script
command. The Script Button button is the interesting one. It creates a
button, confusingly called a **script button** in the icon area. A script button
executes a script when you push it.

Suppose node N is selected. When you press the Script Button button a new
(pink) script button is created. The name of the new button is N's headline
text. The script associated with the new button is N's body text. Now whenever
you press the new button, N's script is executed on the **presently** selected
node. Script buttons are extraordinarily useful. In effect, each script button
defines an instant command! For example, sometimes my fingers get tired of
saving a file. I simply put Save in a node's headline and c.save() in
the body text. I hit the Script Button button and I get a new button called
Save that will save the outline when I press it.

Here's a more interesting example. The following script searches the present
node and its ancestors looking for an @rst node. When such a node is found the
script uses Leo's core c.rstCommands.processTree method to format it. I don't have
to select the actual \@rst node; I can select any of its children::

    for p in p.self_and_parents():
        if p.h.startswith('@rst '):
            c.rstCommands.processTree(p)
            break

**Notes**:

- The scripting plugin pre-defines the c, g and p symbols just as the Execute
  Script command does.

- By default a script button executes the **present** body text of the node that
  original created the script button. This is very handy: you can modify a
  script button's script at any time without having to recreate the script
  button.

- You can delete any script button by right-clicking on it.

- On startup, the scripting plugin scans the entire .leo file and creates a
  script button for every node whose headline starts with @button scriptName.
  **Warning**: this is indeed a security risk of the kind discussed later. This
  feature can be disabled by setting atButtonNodes = True at the start of
  mod_scripting.py.
.. @+node:ekr.20040403173920.24: *3* Running Leo in batch mode
On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form::

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.
Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of
that file using Leo's Execute Script command. By default, Leo sends all
output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable
this output by calling app.log.disable or app.log.enable

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body
and Edit Headline commands. Those commands require interaction with the user.
For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the
headlines in that file::

    path = r"c:\prog\leoCVS\leo\test\test.leo"

    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

    for p in newFrame.c.all_positions():
        g.es(g.toEncodedString(p.h,"utf-8"))
.. @+node:ekr.20080922124033.1: *3* Getting interactive input from scripts
The following code can be run from a script to get input from the user using the minibuffer::

    def getInput (event=None):

       stateName = 'get-input'
       k = c.k
       state = k.getState(stateName)

       if state == 0:
           k.setLabelBlue('Input: ',protect=True)
           k.getArg(event,stateName,1,getInput)
       else:
           k.clearState()
           g.es_print('input: %s' % k.arg)

    getInput()

Let's look at this in detail.  The lines::

    stateName = 'get-input'
    k = c.k
    state = k.getState(stateName)

define a state *name*, 'get-input', unique to this code.
k.getState returns the present state (an int) associated with this state.

When getInput() is first called, the state returned by k.getState will be 0,
so the following lines are executed::

    if state == 0:
        k.setLabelBlue('Input: ',protect=True)
        k.getArg(event,stateName,1,getInput)

These lines put a protected label in the minibuffer:
the user can't delete the label by backspacing.
getArg, and the rest of Leo's key handling code, take care of the extremely
complex details of handling key strokes in states.
The call to getArg never returns.
Instead, when the user has finished entering the input by typing <Return>
getArg calls getInput so that k.getState will return state 1, the value
passed as the third argument to k.getArg.
The following lines handle state 1::

    else:
        k.clearState()
        g.es_print('input: %s' % k.arg)

k.arg is the value returned by k.getArg.
This example code just prints the value of k.arg and clears the input state.
.. @+node:ville.20090603183524.5672: *3* Creating Leo commands with the @g.command decorator
You can use the @g.command decorator to create new commands. This is an easy-to-use
wrapper for c.k.registerCommand(), with the following advantages over it:

* The new command is automatically created for all Leo controllers (open Leo documents).

* The new command is also automatically available on all new Leo controllers 
  (documents that will be opened in the future).

* Prettier syntax.

Therefore, @g.command can be naturally 
prototyped with execute-script (Ctrl+b) in Leo node.

As an example, you can execute this script to make command hello available::

    @g.command('hello')
    def hello_f(event):
        # use even['c'] to access controller
        c = event['c']
        pos = c.currentPosition()
        g.es('hello from', pos.h)

If you want to create a plugin that only exposes new commands, this is basically all you need in the plugins .py file.
There is no need to hook up for 'after-create-leo-frame' just to make your commands available.

If you want to create a command in object oriented style (so that the commands deal with your own objects), 
create them using closures like this (note how self is available inside command functions)::

    class MyCommands:
        def create(self):        
            @g.command('foo1')
            def foo1_f(event):
               self.foo = 1

            @g.command('foo2')
            def foo2_f(event):
               self.foo = 2

            @g.command('foo-print')
            def foo_print_f(event):
               g.es('foo is', self.foo)

    o = MyCommands()
    o.create()

Note that running create() in this example in `after-create-leo-frame` is pointless - the
newly created commands will override the commands in all previous controllers. You should consider 
this in your plugin design, and create your commands only once per Leo session.
.. @+node:ekr.20100506062734.11593: *3* Modifying plugins with @script scripts
The mod_scripting plugin runs @scripts before plugin initiation is complete.
Thus, such scripts can not directly modify plugins. Instead, a script can create
an event handler for the after-create-leo-frame that will modify the plugin.

For example, the following modifies the cleo.py plugin after Leo has completed loading it::

    def prikey(self, v):
        try:
            pa = int(self.getat(v, 'priority'))
        except ValueError:
            pa = -1

        if pa == 24:
            pa = -1
        if pa == 10:
            pa = -2

        return pa

    import types
    from leo.core import leoPlugins

    def on_create(tag, keywords):
        c.cleo.prikey = types.MethodType(prikey, c.cleo, c.cleo.__class__)

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("after-create-leo-frame",on_create)

Attempting to modify c.cleo.prikey immediately in the @script gives an
AttributeError as c has no .cleo when the @script is executed. Deferring it by
using registerHandler() avoids the problem.
