<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.140">Leo stores options in **@settings trees**, outlines whose headline is @settings. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files. This scheme allows for the following kinds of settings:

- Per-installation or per-machine settings.
- Per-user settings.
- Per-folder settings.
- Per-file settings.

There are four kinds of settings files:

1. **Default settings files**, named **leoSettings.leo**. Although they can be used in other ways, they typically contain default settings.

2. **Personal settings files**, named **myLeoSettings.leo**. They provide a way of ensuring that your customized settings are not altered when updating Leo from git or while installing a new version of Leo. The myLeoSettings.leo acts much like Python's site-customize.py file. myLeoSettings.leo will never be part of any Leo distribution, and it will never exist in Leo's cvs repository. This solution is *much* better than trying to update leoSettings.leo with scripts.

3. **Machine settings files**, named **LeoSettings.leo** (note the capital 'L'), and appearing in a unique directory.

4. **Command-line settings files**, specified using Leo's -c command-line option. Any .leo file may be used, provided it has an @settings tree. These files typically provide a common set of settings for files scattered in various places on the file system.

The following sections describe the kinds of nodes in @settings trees.

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.224" str_atime="1376412038.0">Naively using plugins can expose you and your .leo files to malicious attacks. The fundamental principles are::

    Scripts and plugins must never blindly execute code from untrusted sources.

and::

    .leo files obtained from other people may potentially contain hostile code.

Stephen Schaefer summarizes the danger this way::

    I foresee a future in which the majority of leo projects come from
    marginally trusted sources...a world of leo documents sent hither
    and yon - resumes, project proposals, textbooks, magazines,
    contracts - and as a race of Pandora's, we cannot resist wanting
    to see "What's in the box?" And are we going to fire up a text
    editor to make a detailed examination of the ASCII XML? Never!
    We're going to double click on the cute leo file icon, and leo
    will fire up in all its raging glory. Just like Word (and its
    macros) or Excel (and its macros).

In other words::

    When we share "our" .leo files we can NOT assume that we know what
    is in our "own" documents!

Not all environments are untrustworthy. Code in a commercial cvs repository is probably trustworthy: employees might be terminated for posting malicious code. Still, the potential for abuse exists anywhere.

In Python it is very easy to write a script that will blindly execute other scripts::

    # Warning: extremely dangerous code

    # Execute the body text of all nodes that start with `@script`.
    def onLoadFile():
        for p in c.all_positions():
            h = p.h.lower()
            if g.match_word(h,0,"@script"):
                s = p.b
                if s and len(s) &gt; 0:
                    try: # SECURITY BREACH: s may be malicious!
                        exec(s + '\n')
                    except:
                        es_exception()

Executing this kind of code is typically an intolerable security risk. **Important**: rexec provides *no protection whatever*. Leo is a repository of source code, so any text operation is potentially malicious. For example, consider the following script, which is valid in rexec mode::

    badNode = c.p
    for p in c.all_positions():
        &lt;&lt; change `rexec` to `exec` in p's body &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; delete badNode &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; clear the undo stack &gt;&gt;

This script will introduce a security hole the .leo file without doing anything prohibited by rexec, and without leaving any traces of the perpetrating script behind. The damage will become permanent *outside* this script when the user saves the .leo file.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.240" str_atime="1376411987.0">If a plugin has a function at the outer (module) level called unitTest, Leo's unit tests will call that function.

So it would be good if writers of plugins would create such a unitTest function. To indicate a failure the unitTest can just throw an exception. Leo's plugins test suite takes care of the rest.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.248">The following sections describe the complexities that were involved in designing Leo's simple-looking mechanisms. They give a pseudo-chronological list of the major Aha's involved in creating Leo2. These Aha's form the real design and theory of operation of Leo. 

I am writing these notes for several reasons. First, the initial design and coding of Leo2, spanning a period of about 8 weeks, was some of the most creative and rewarding work I have ever done. The result is elegant and simple. I'm proud of it. Second, much of the design work is not reflected in the code, because improved design often eliminated code entirely. The final code is so elegant that it obscures the hard work that created it. Third, you must understand this design in order to understand the implementation of @file trees and their external files. Someday someone else may take charge of Leo. That person should know what really makes Leo work.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.249">In the summer of 2001 I began work on a project that for a long time I had considered impossible. I had long considered that "private" file formats such as .leo files were the only way to represent an outline properly and safely. I'm not sure what changed my mind, but I finally was willing to consider that information embedded in external files might be useful. This meant accepting the possibility that sentinel lines might be corrupted. This was a crucial first step. If we can trust the user not to corrupt sentinel lines than we can embed almost any kind of information into a external file.

There were several motivations for this work. I wanted to eliminate the need for explicit Tangle and Untangle commands. I thought of this as "Untangle on Read/Tangle on Write." If tangling and untangling could be made automatic it would save the user a lot of work. I also wanted to make external files the primary sources files. .leo files might be made much smaller external files contained the primary source information. This hope turned out to be false.

The result of this design work was something I originally called Leo2. Now, I prefer to talk about @file trees. Initially most design issues were unresolved or unknown. I resolved to attempt a robust error-recovery scheme, not knowing in advance what that might involve. I also wanted to solve what I thought of as the "cross-file clone" problem: clones that point from a .leo outline into a external file. With Leo1 cross-file clones do not exist; everything is in the same .leo file. It was clear that Leo2 would have to change some aspects of clones, but all details were fuzzy.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.250">The next step was also crucial. I started to use Leo1 as a prototype to design what the new body pane would look like to the user. In retrospect, using Leo1 as a prototype for Leo2 was just as inspired as using MORE as a prototype for Leo1. Both prototypes marked the true beginning of their respective projects. The Leo2 prototype was a mockup in Python of the code for reading and writing derived files.

Writing the prototype got me thinking about improving noweb. With my experience with Leo1, I was able to create a new markup language that took advantage of outline structure. I called the new language "simplified noweb", though that terminology is obsolete. I created @file nodes to distinguish between the old and new ways of creating external files. In Leo1, the @code directive is simply an abbreviation for a section definition line. Simplified noweb used @c as an abbreviation for @code. More importantly, simplified noweb used @c to separate doc parts from code parts without necessarily specifying a section name. It quickly became apparent that most nodes could be unnamed. All I needed was the @others directive to specify the location for all such unnamed nodes.

From the start, simplified noweb was a joy to use. The @others directive could replace all section definition lines. Furthermore, I could make @doc directive optional if the body pane started in "code mode". But this meant that plain body text could become a program! This was an amazing discovery. These Aha's got me excited about Leo2. This was important, as it motivated me to do a lot of difficult design work.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.251">In spite of this excitement, I was uneasy. After much "daydreaming" I realized that I was afraid that reading and writing external files would be interrupted by a long series of alerts. I saw that designing the "user interaction" during reading and writing would be very important. The next Aha was that I could replace a long series of alerts with messages to the log window, followed by a single "summary" alert. Much later I saw how to eliminate alerts entirely.

At this time I thought there would be two kinds of "errors" while reading external files. Warnings would alert the user that something non-serious had happened. True errors would alert the user that data might have been lost. Indeed, if Leo2 saves orphan and ignored nodes in a .leo file under an @file node, then read errors could endanger such nodes. Much later I saw that a robust error recovery scheme demands that @file nodes not contain orphan and @ignored nodes. (More on this subject later.) But if orphan and @ignored nodes are moved out of @file trees, there are no read errors that can cause data loss! So the distinction between warnings and errors finally went away.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.252">I next turned my attention to writing @file nodes. A huge Aha: I realized that sentinel lines must contain both a leading and a trailing newline. The general principle is this: the write code must contain absolutely no "conditional" logic, because otherwise the read code could not figure out whether the condition should be true or false. So external files contain blank lines between sentinel lines. These "extra" newlines are very useful, because the read (untangle) code can now easily determine exactly where every blank, tab and newline of the external file came from. It would be hard to overstate how important this simplifying principle was in practice.

Much later, with urging from a customer, I realized that the write code could safely remove "extra" newlines between sentinels with a caching scheme in the low level atFile::os() routine. This scheme does not alter the body of the write code in any way: in effect, sentinels still contain leading and trailing "logical" newlines. The read code had to be modified to handle "missing" leading newlines, but this can always be done assuming that sentinels still contain logical leading and trailing newlines!

At about this time I designed a clever way of having the write code tell the read code which newlines were inserted in doc parts. (The whole point of doc parts is to have the write code format long comments by splitting long lines.) To quote from my diary:

"We can use the following convention to determine where putDocPart has inserted line breaks: A line in a doc part is followed by an inserted newline if and only if the newline is preceded by whitespace. This is an elegant convention, and is essentially invisible to the user. Tangle outputs words until the line would become too long, and then it inserts a newline. To preserve all whitespace, tangle always includes the whitespace that terminates a word on the same line as the word itself. Therefore, split lines always end in whitespace. To make this convention work, tangle only has to delete the trailing whitespace of all lines that are followed by a 'real' newline."
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.253">After the write code was working I turned my attention to the read (untangle) code. Leo's Untangle command is the most complex and difficult code I have ever written. Imagine my surprise when I realized that the Leo2 read code is essentially trivial! Indeed, the Leo2 untangle code is like an assembler. The read code scans lines of a external files looking for "opcodes", that is, sentinel lines, and executes some simple code for each separate opcode. The heart of this code is the scanText routine in atFile.cpp.

The read code was written and debugged in less than two days! It is the most elegant code I have ever written. While perfecting the read code I realized that sentinel lines should show the complete nesting structure found in the outline, even if this information seems redundant. For example, I was tempted to use a single sentinel to represent an @other directive, but finally abandoned this plan in favor of the @+other and @-other sentinels.

This redundancy greatly simplified the read code and made the structure of external files absolutely clear. Moreover, it turned out that we need, in general, all the information created by the present sentinel lines. In short, sentinels are as simple as they can be, and no simpler.

The atFile::createNthChild method is a very important: it ensures that nodes will be correctly inserted into the outline. createNthChild must be bullet-proof if the Read code is to be robust. Note that the write code outputs @node sentinels, that is, section definitions, in the order in which sections are referenced in the outline, not the order in which sections appear in the outline. So createNthChild must insert the n'th node of parent p properly even if p contains fewer than n-1 children! The write code ensures that section references are properly nested: @node sentinels are enclosed in @node sentinels for all their ancestors in the @file tree. createNthChild creates dummy siblings as needed, then replaces the dummy siblings later when their actual definitions, that is, @node sentinels, are encountered.

At this point the fundamental read/write code was complete. I found three minor bugs in the code over the next week or so, but it was clear that the read/write code formed a rock-solid base from which to continue design and implementation. This was an entirely unexpected surprise.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.254">At this point I could read and write external files "by hand", using temporary Read and Write commands. The next step was to integrate the reading and writing of external files with the loading and saving of .leo files. From time to time I made minor changes to the drivers for the read/write code to accommodate the Load and Save code, but at no time did I significantly alter the read or write code itself.

The user interaction of the Load and Save commands drove the design and implementation of the load/store code. The most important questions were: "what do we tell the user?", and "what does the user do with the information?" It turns out that the user can't make any complex decision during error recovery because the user doesn't have nearly enough information to make an informed choice. In turn, this means that certain kinds of error recovery schemes are out of the question...
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.255">I now turned my attention to "attributes" of nodes. Most attributes, like user marks, are non-essential. However, clone information is essential; we must never lose clone links. At this time I had a preliminary design for cross-file clones that involved a two part "pointer" consisting of a full path name and an immutable clone index within the external file. Eventually such pointers completely disappeared, but the immutable clone indices remain.

My first thought was that it would be good to store all attributes in @node sentinels in the external file, but experience showed that would be irritating. Indeed, one wants Leo2 to rewrite external files only if something essential has changed. For example, one doesn't want to rewrite the external file just because a different node as been selected.

At this point I had another Aha: we can use the .leo file to store all non-essential attributes. For example, this means that the .leo file, not the external files, will change if we select a new node. In effect, the .leo file mirrors the external file. The only reason to store nodes in the .leo file under an @file node is to carry these attributes, so Leo2 wrote dummy nodes that do not reference body text. Much later I saw that dummy nodes were dangerous and that .leo files should contain all information found in external files.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.256">The concept of mirroring created a huge breakthrough with cross-file clones: Here is an excerpt of an email i sent to my brother Speed:

"I realized this morning that since a .leo file contains dummy vnodes for all nodes in a external file, those dummy nodes can carry clone info! I changed one line to make sure that the write code always writes clone info in dummy vnodes and voila! Cross-file clones worked!"

All of Leo1's clone code could be used completely unchanged. Everything "just works".
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.257">At first I thought we could make sure that the .leo file always correctly mirrors all external file, but disastrous experience showed that is a completely false hope. Indeed, backup .leo files will almost never mirror external file correctly. So it became urgent to find a completely fool-proof error recovery scheme.

I had known for quite a while that error recovery should work "as if" the mirroring nodes were deleted, then recreated afresh. Several failed attempts at an error recovery scheme convinced me that error recovery would actually have to delete all dummy nodes and then do a complete reread. This is what Leo2 does.

But erasing dummy nodes would destroy any orphan and ignored nodes--by definition such nodes appear nowhere in the external file. Therefore, I had to enforce the rule that @file nodes should contain no such nodes. Here is an email I wrote to my brother, Speed Ream discussing what turned out to be the penultimate error recovery scheme:

"The error recovery saga continues. After much pondering and some trial coding I have changed my mind about orphans and @ignored nodes. They simply should never appear as descendants of @file nodes. Fortunately, this simplifies all aspects of Leo2. Leo2 will issue a warning (not an error) if an orphan or @ignored node appears as the descendant of an @file node when a .leo file is being saved. If any warnings occur while writing the external file, Leo2 will write the "offending" @file tree to the .leo file instead of the external file. This has several advantages:

1. The user gets warned about orphan nodes. These are useful warnings! Orphan nodes arise from missing @others directives or missing section references.

2. The user doesn't have to change anything immediately in order to save an outline. This is very important. Besides warnings about orphans, Leo2 will also warn about undefined or unreferenced sections. User's shouldn't have to fix these warnings to do a Save!

3. No errors or alerts will occur during Reading or Writing, so the user's anxiety level goes way down. At worst, some informational message will be sent to the log. The user will never have to make important decisions during Loads or Saves. [At last the dubious distinction between errors and warnings disappears.]

4. Error recovery can be bullet-proof. Simple code will guarantee that after any read operation the structure of an @file node will match the structure of the external file. Also, sentinels in external files will now account for all children of an @file node. There are no more "missing nodes" that must be filled in using the .leo file. Finally, error recovery will never change the @file tree in any way: no more "recovered nodes" nodes.

5. The present read code can be used almost unchanged. The only addition is the posting of a warning if the structure of the .leo file does not match the structure of the external file. We need a warning because non-essential attribute of nodes (like user marks) may be altered."

This ends the original history of Leo2. In fact, it took quite a while before Leo recovered properly from all errors. I finally saw that .leo files should duplicate all information in external files. This allows a .leo file to be used a single backup file and allows maximal error recovery in all situations. It took several months to stamp out several subtle bugs involving clones that caused spurious read errors. Such errors undermine confidence in Leo and can cause disastrous reversions. See my diary entries for January 2002 in leo.py for details.

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.268">Leo's grand strategy for handling text is as follows:

1. Internally, Leo uses unicode objects for all text.

2. When reading files or user input, Leo converts all plain (encoded)
   strings to unicode.

3. When reading or writing files, Leo converts unicode strings to encoded
   strings.
   
To make this strategy work, Leo must know the encoding used for external files. This is why Leo supports the @encoding directive and various encoding-related settings.

The g.toUnicode and g.toEncodedString functions convert to and from unicode. These methods catch all unicode-related exceptions.

The g.u function should be used *only* to convert from the Qt string type (a wrapper for a unicode string) to unicode. Do not use g.u instead of g.toUnicode.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.354">Leo uses unicode internally for all strings.

1. Leo converts headline and body text to unicode when reading .leo files and external files. Both .leo files and external files may specify their encoding.  The default is utf-8. If the encoding used in a external file is not "utf-8" it is represented in the @+leo sentinel line. For example::

        #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

    The utf-8 encoding is a "lossless" encoding (it can represent all
    unicode code points), so converting to and from utf-8 plain
    strings will never cause a problem. When reading or writing a
    character not in a "lossy" encoding, Leo converts such characters
    to '?' and issues a warning.

2. When writing .leo files and external files Leo uses the same encoding used to read the file, again with utf-8 used as a default.

3. leoSettings.leo contains the following Unicode settings, with the defaults as shown::

        default_derived_file_encoding = UTF-8 
        new_leo_file_encoding = UTF-8 

    These control the default encodings used when writing external
    files and .leo files. Changing the new_leo_file_encoding setting
    is not recommended. See the comments in leoSettings.leo. You may
    set default_derived_file_encoding to anything that makes sense for
    you.

4. The @encoding directive specifies the encoding used in a external file. You can't mix encodings in a single external file.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.357">Here are the XML elements that may appear in Leo files:

&lt;?xml&gt;
    Leo files start with the following line::

        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;?xml-stylesheet&gt;
    An xml-stylesheet line is option.  For example::

        &lt;?xml-stylesheet ekr_stylesheet?&gt;

&lt;leo_file&gt;
    The &lt;leo_file&gt; element opens an element that contains the entire file.
    &lt;/leo_file&gt; ends the file.

&lt;leo_header&gt; 
    The &lt;leo_header&gt; element specifies version information and other information
    that affects how Leo parses the file.  For example::

        &lt;leo_header file_format="2" tnodes="0" max_tnode_index="5725" clone_windows="0"/&gt;

    The file_format attribute gives the 'major' format number.
    It is '2' for all 4.x versions of Leo.
    The tnodes and clone_windows attributes are no longer used.
    The max_tnode_index	attribute is the largest tnode index.

&lt;globals&gt;
    The globals element specifies information relating to the entire file.
    For example::

        &lt;globals body_outline_ratio="0.50"&gt;
            &lt;global_window_position top="27" left="27" height="472" width="571"/&gt;
            &lt;global_log_window_position top="183" left="446" height="397" width="534"/&gt;
        &lt;/globals&gt;

    -   The body_outline_ratio attribute specifies the ratio of the height of the body pane to
        the total height of the Leo window.
        It initializes the position of the splitter separating the outline pane from the body pane.

    -   The global_window_position and global_log_window_position elements
        specify the position of the Leo window and Log window in global coordinates:

&lt;preferences&gt;
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the &lt;preferences&gt; element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty &lt;preferences&gt; element.

&lt;find_panel_settings&gt;
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the &lt;find_panel_settings&gt; element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty &lt;find_panel_settings&gt; element.

&lt;clone_windows&gt;
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the &lt;clone_windows&gt; element when reading.
    Leo no longer writes &lt;clone_windows&gt; elements.

&lt;vnodes&gt;
    A single &lt;vnodes&gt; element contains nested &lt;v&gt; elements.
    &lt;v&gt; elements correspond to vnodes.
    The nesting of &lt;v&gt; elements indicates outline structure in the obvious way.

&lt;v&gt;
    The &lt;v&gt; element represents a single vnode and has the following form::

        &lt;v...&gt;&lt;vh&gt;sss&lt;/vh&gt; (zero or more nested v elements) &lt;/v&gt;

    The &lt;vh&gt; element specifies the headline text.
    sss is the headline text encoded with the usual XML escapes.
    As shown above, a &lt;v&gt; element may contain nested &lt;v&gt; elements.
    This nesting indicates outline structure in the obvious way.
    Zero or more of the following attributes may appear in &lt;v&gt; elements::

        t=name.timestamp.n
        a="xxx"

    The t="Tnnn" attribute specifies the &lt;t&gt; element associated with a &lt;v&gt; element.
    The a="xxx" attribute specifies vnode attributes.
    The xxx denotes one or more upper-case letters whose meanings are as follows::

        C	The vnode is a clone. (Not used in 4.x)
        E	The vnode is expanded so its children are visible.
        M	The vnode is marked.
        T	The vnode is the top visible node.
        V	The vnode is the current vnode.

    For example, a="EM"  specifies that the vnode is expanded and is marked.

    **New in 4.0**:

    -   &lt;v&gt; elements corresponding to @file nodes now contain tnodeList attributes.
        The tnodeList attribute allows Leo to recreate the order in which nodes should 
        appear in the outline.
        The tnodeList attribute is a list of gnx's: global node indices.
        See Format of external files (4.x) for the format of gnx's.

    -   Plugins and scripts may add attributes to &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements.
        See `Writing plugins`_ for details.

&lt;tnodes&gt;
    A single &lt;tnodes&gt; element contains a non-nested list of &lt;t&gt; elements.

&lt;t&gt;
    The &lt;t&gt; element represents the body text of the corresponding &lt;v&gt; element.
    It has this form::

        &lt;t tx="&lt;gnx&gt;"&gt;sss&lt;/t&gt;

    The tx attribute is required.
    The t attribute of &lt;v&gt; elements refer to this tx attribute.
    sss is the body text encoded with the usual XML escapes.

    **New in 4.0**: Plugins and scripts may add attributes to &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt;
    elements. See `Writing plugins`_ for details.

<t tx="TL.20080804095315.9">If you use the open-with command to open a node text in Vim and your Vim's "tag" file refers to external files then there is a risk that a external file that is initially displayed via the "tag" command" in Vim is accidentally edited and saved from the external Vim editor while your Leo session still contains the external file's original text that may later recreate the original external file during a Leo save operation (overwriting the changes saved from the Vim editor).

To prevent this problem, modifications to external files can be avoided by using Vim's "modeline" feature to disable editing of external files.

Vim's "modeline" feature scans each loaded buffer for text at the top or bottom of the file containing " vim:" followed by a series of Vim options. The text is usually embedded within a comment. The following example prevents modifications to a buffer in a Python file::

    # vim:noma (A space is required between the '#' and "vim:noma")

If this line is placed in a separate Leo node at the top or bottom of the list of nodes under a external file node (ex: @file) then any external file saved and then later loaded into Vim will, by default, not be modifiable. If a derived file does need to be edited then modifications can be re-enabled on a file-by-file basis by issuing Vim's ":ma" command while viewing the derived file.

The number of lines that Vim checks at the top and bottom of the buffer is configurable. The following Vim command must be placed in the vimrc file to allow for Leo's trailing sentinel lines::

    set modelines=8

Issue the ":help modeline" command within Vim for the more information about modelines.

Scripting Leo with Python
#########################

    "Leo a way to make a "living" document. A document built out of
    discrete parts that can be re-organized on the fly to meet the needs of
    a varying audience... just the possibility of keeping system
    maintenance scripts in the IT manual is mind boggling."---David Nichols

This chapter tells how to write **Leo scripts**, Python scripts run from
any Leo node. This chapter also discusses several topics related to
scripting: autocompletion, @button and @test.

This chapter is intended for those fairly comfortable with Python
scripting. If you are not, please study the excellent `Python Tutorial &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/&gt;`_.

As an alternative to this chapter, Jacob Peck has written a more `informal scripting tutorial &lt;http://blog.suspended-chord.info/2014/01/28/intro-to-leo-scripting/&gt;`_.

    c.doCommand(c.markHeadline,label="markheadline")

You can also call command handlers directly so that hooks will not be called::

    c.markHeadline()

You can invoke minibuffer commands by name.  For example::

    c.executeMinibufferCommand('open-outline')

c.keyHandler.funcReturn contains the value returned from the command. In many cases, as above, this value is simply 'break'.

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows. Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of that file using Leo's Execute Script command. By default, Leo sends all output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable this output by calling app.log.disable or app.log.enable

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body and Edit Headline commands. Those commands require interaction with the user. For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the headlines in that file::

    path = g.os_path_finalize_join(g.app.loadDir,'..','test','test.leo')
    assert g.os_path_exists(path),path

    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    c2 = g.openWithFileName(path)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

    for p in c2.all_positions():
        g.es(g.toEncodedString(p.h,"utf-8"))

From one of my all-time favorite movie scenes, in My Cousin Vinny::

    Mona Lisa Vito: So what's your problem?
    Vinny Gambini: My problem is, I wanted to win my first case
    without any help from anybody.
    Mona Lisa: Well, I guess that plan's moot.
    Vinny : Yeah.
    Mona Lisa: You know, this could be a sign of things to come.
    You win all your cases, but with somebody else's help, right?
    You win case after case, and then afterwards you have to go up
    to somebody and you have to say, "thank you."
    [pause]
    Oh my God, what a fucking nightmare! 

Leo owes much of its visual design to MORE, possibly the most elegant computer program ever written. Leo's clone nodes are inspired by MORE.

<t tx="ekr.20040416080538">The following deserve special mention:

David Brock wrote TSyntaxMemo, used in early versions of Leo. Terry Brown contributed many important features including Leo's user-modifiable panes, and several important plugins, including bookmarks.py and todo.py. e inspired @button nodes, a truly brilliant idea. The late Bob Fitzwater kept me focused on design. Oh, how I wish he could see today's Leo. Jonathan M. Gilligan showed how to put the Leo icon in Leo's windows. Donald Knuth invented the CWEB language and literate programming. LeoUser (B.H.) contributed numerous plugins, including a prototype for Leo's minibuffer, and wrote jyLeo: Leo in Jython. The late Bernhard Mulder invented the fundamental @shadow algorithm, a stroke of genius. Bernhard also inspired Leo's generators and position class. The one-node world could not have happened without Bernhard. Joe Orr created tutorials and XSLT stylesheets for Leo: http://www.jserv.com/jk_orr/xml/leo.htm. John K. Ousterhout created tcl/Tk, used in early versions of Leo. Neal Norwitz wrote PyChecker. Marc-Antoine Parent urged me to use XML for Leo's file format and helped improve it. Paul Paterson created the plugin architecture, helped with spell checking and contributed many plugins. François Pinard wrote pymacs. Norman Ramsey created noweb and gave permission to quote from the noweb web documentation. Rich Ries has contributed a huge number of suggestions. Steven P. Schaefer pointed out security problems lurking in event handlers and @script. Gil Shwartz helped with unicode support. Phil Straus has been a great friend and constant support. Kent Tenney has constantly lobbied to make Leo easier to use and understand. His comment opened the door to the one-node world. Guido van Rossum created Python, Tkinter and the Python License. Dave Winer created MORE. Ville M. Vainio made invaluable contributions, including the one-node world and the IPython related code.  Ville also wrote the contextmenu.py and valuespace.py plugins. Dan Winkler helped support Leo on the Mac.

Special thanks to my family. My brother, David Speed Ream, tested Leo and made many useful suggestions. Rebecca, James and Linda make it all worthwhile. During a conversation with Rebecca I realized that MORE could be used as a prototype for Leo. That was a crucial first step.

<t tx="ekr.20050306090601">.. index:: uA

Leo's .leo file format is extensible. The basis for extending .leo files are the v.unknownAttributes ivars of vnodes, also know as **user attributes**, uA's for short. Leo translates between uA's and xml attributes in the corresponding &lt;v&gt; elements in .leo files. Plugins may also use v.tempAttributes ivars to hold temporary information that will *not* be written to the .leo file. These two ivars are called **attribute ivars**.

Attribute ivars must be Python dictionaries, whose keys are names of plugins and whose values are *other* dictionaries, called **inner dictionaries**, for exclusive use of each plugin.

The v.u Python property allows plugins to get and set v.unknownAttributes easily::

    d = v.u # gets uA (the outer dict) for v
    v.u = d # sets uA (the outer dict) for v

For example::

    plugin_name = 'xyzzy'
    d = v.u # Get the outer dict.
    inner_d = d.get(plugin_name,{}) # Get the inner dict.
    inner_d ['duration']= 5
    inner_d ['notes'] "This is a note."
    d [plugin_name] = inner_d
    v.u = d

No corresponding Python properties exist for v.tempAttributes, so the corresponding example would be::

    plugin_name = 'xyzzy'
    # Get the outer dict.
    if hasattr(p.v,'tempAttributes'): d = p.v.tempAttributes
    else: d = {}
    inner_d = d.get(plugin_name,{}) # Get the inner dict.
    inner_d ['duration'] = 5
    inner_d ['notes'] = "This is a note."
    d [plugin_name] = inner_d
    p.v.tempAttributes = d

**Important**: All members of inner dictionaries should be picklable: Leo uses Python's Pickle module to encode all values in these dictionaries. Leo will discard any attributes that can not be pickled. This should not be a major problem to plugins. For example, instead of putting a tnode into these dictionaries, a plugin could put the tnode's gnx (a string) in the dictionary.

**Note**: Leo does *not* pickle members of inner dictionaries whose name (key) starts with str\_. The values of such members should be a Python string. This convention allows strings to appear in .leo files in a more readable format.

Here is how Leo associates uA's with &lt;v&gt; elements in .leo files:

- **Native xml attributes** are the attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements that are known (treated specially) by Leo's read/write code. The native attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements are a, t, vtag, tnodeList, marks, expanded and descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes. All other attributes of &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements are **foreign xml attributes**.

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create v.unknownAttributes ivars for any vnode whose corresponding &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt; element contains a foreign xml attribute.

- When writing a file, Leo will write foreign xml attributes in &lt;v&gt; elements if the corresponding vnode contains an unknownAttributes ivar.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing the unknownAttributes ivars.

<t tx="ekr.20050417072710.1">Plugins and scripts should call u.beforeX and u.afterX methods to describe the operation that is being performed. **Note**: u is shorthand for c.undoer. Most u.beforeX methods return undoData that the client code merely passes to the corresponding u.afterX method. This data contains the 'before' snapshot. The u.afterX methods then create a bead containing both the 'before' and 'after' snapshots.

u.beforeChangeGroup and u.afterChangeGroup allow multiple calls to u.beforeX and u.afterX methods to be treated as a single undoable entry. See the code for the Replace All, Sort, Promote and Demote commands for examples. The u.beforeChangeGroup and u.afterChangeGroup methods substantially reduce the number of u.beforeX and afterX methods needed.

Plugins and scripts may define their own u.beforeX and afterX methods. Indeed, u.afterX merely needs to set the bunch.undoHelper and bunch.redoHelper ivars to the methods used to undo and redo the operation. See the code for the various u.beforeX and afterX methods for guidance.

p.setDirty and p.setAllAncestorAtFileNodesDirty now return a dirtyVnodeList that all vnodes that became dirty as the result of an operation. More than one list may be generated: client code is responsible for merging lists using the pattern dirtyVnodeList.extend(dirtyVnodeList2)

See the section &lt;&lt; How Leo implements unlimited undo &gt;&gt; in leoUndo.py for more details. In general, the best way to see how to implement undo is to see how Leo's core calls the u.beforeX and afterX methods.

.. _`rst3 tutorial`: tutorial-rst3.html

Please read the `rst3 tutorial`_ before reading this chapter.

This chapter covers advanced settings and features of the rst3 command. It is for power users only.

*Are you sure you want to read this chapter?* The tutorial covers everything most people need to know about the rst3 command. Leo's own documentation uses none of the features discussed here.

.. contents::
    :depth: 4
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.10">The rst3 command defines a code-block rST directive. The primary purpose of this directive is to show formatted source code.

In rst mode you can insert the code-block directive like any other rST markup. The rst3 command generates code-block directives automatically in code mode. This directive takes one argument, a language name.  Like this::

    .. code-block:: Python

        import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
        import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

The output looks like this::

    import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

.. _`Scripting Tutorial`:   tutorial-scripting.html

See the `Scripting Tutorial`_ for many examples of how to use code-blocks.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.11">HTML files generated by the rst3 command assume that three .css (cascading style sheet) files exist in the same directory. For the HTML output to look good the following .css files should exist:

- default.css is the default style sheet that docutils expects to exist.

- leo_rst.css contains some style improvements based on Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory.

.. - silver_city.css is the style sheet that controls the syntax highlighting generated by SilverCity.

The latter two style sheets are imported at the end of the default.css.

**Important:** You can use cascading style sheets to do things that otherwise wouldn't be possible with "plain" rST. For instance, the background color of this page was specified in a body style.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.13">.. _ListManagerDocs.html: http://leoeditor.com/ListManagerDocs.html
.. _wxListManager.leo:    http://leoeditor.com/wxListManager.leo

The file `ListManagerDocs.html`_ is an impressive example of the kind of output that can be generated relatively easily using the rst3 command.

The source for ListManagerDocs.html is `wxListManager.leo`_. **Important**: wxListManager.leo was written for the old rst2 plugin; it could be greatly simplified if adapted for the rst3 command.

This documentation was created using the rst3 command. The source code for this documentation is in LeoDocs.leo. The source code for the rst3 command is in leoRst.py in leoPy.leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.14">Leo 5.1 substantially simplifies the code in leoRst.py. The only rules:

- All top-level commands must call rst.initSettings, which calls rst.preprocessTree.
- Code that writes body text must call rst.init_write.

``rst.d0``
    This dictionary contains the defaults for each option. Keys are the option name, *not* including the ``rst3_`` prefix. Settings in @settings trees update its entries.
    
``rst.dd``
    A dictionary of dictionaries. Keys are vnodes. Values are a dictionary of settings set in that *particular* vnode.

``rst.getOption(p,name)``
    Searches the ``rst.dd`` and ``rst.d0`` dicts, starting at ``p``, looking for an entry for ``name``. This greatly simplifies the code that creates ``rst.dd``. Surprisingly, this search makes the code about 50% faster.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.16">Josef Dalcolmo wrote the initial rst plugin. Timo Honkasalo, Bernhard Mulder, Paul Paterson, Kent Tenney and Steve Zatz made contributions to the rst and rst2 plugins.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.4">The section covers complex options arising from two equivalent problems:

- How to generate documentation from computer source code in a Leo outline.
- How to embed documentation in computer source code in a Leo outline.

*Please stop reading now if these problems don't interest you!*
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.5">The following options are for the use of Bernhard Mulder's http plugin. The http plugin creates an http server running on a local port, typically 8080. When the http plugin is running you will see a purple message in the log window that looks something like this::

    http serving enabled on port 8080, version 0.91

To use the http plugin, start a web browser and enter this url::

    http://localhost:8080/

You will see a a top level page containing one link for every open .leo file. Clicking on a link will cause the http server to pass a new page to the browser. You can use the browser's refresh button to update the top-level view in the browser after you have opened or closed files.

**Important**: See the docstring for the http plugin for information on configuring the plugin. Some of the following rst3 settings must match values of settings for the http plugin.

Here are the rst3 options that support the http plugin:

.. glossary::

``http_server_support (default: False)``
    A master switch: none of the following options have any effect unless this option is True. If True, the rst3 command does the following:

- Writes **node markers** in the rst output for use by the http plugin. Node markers are rst named hyperlink targets. By default they look like: ``.. _http-node-marker-N``, where N is a unique node number.

- Adds additional information to all nodes of the tree being formatted using Leo's unknownAttributes mechanism.

``http_attributename (default: rst_http_attribute)``
    The name of the attribute name written to the ``unknownAttributes`` attribute of each outline node in the rst root tree. The default is ``rst_http_attribute``. It should match this setting: ``@string rst_http_attributename = rst_http_attribute``.

``clear_http_attributes (default: False)``
    **True**: the rst3 command initially clears the fields specified by `http_attributename`.  

``node_begin_marker (default: http-node-marker-)``
    The string used for node markers.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.7">Any headline that starts with @rst- controls the rst3 command.

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

..  @rst-code &lt;section&gt; 
..      Enter code mode. (Code mode is covered in the advanced topics sections)
..      Create a section if the show_headlines option is True.

``@rst-ignore &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Ignore the node and its descendants.

``@rst-ignore-node &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Ignore the node, but *not* its descendants.

``@rst-ignore-tree &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Same as @rst-ignore. Ignore the node and its descendants.

``@rst-no-head &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Ignore the headline but not the body text of this node. *This option has no effect on descendant nodes*.

``@rst-no-headlines &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Ignore the headline of this node and descendant nodes.

``@rst-option &lt;option&gt; = &lt;value&gt;``
    Set a single option to the given value. The default value is True.

``@rst-options &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Set options from body text. The body text should contain nothing but
    lines of the form ``&lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;``

``@rst-preformat &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Format the body text of the node as computer source code. In effect, this option adds a line containing '::' at the start of the body text. The option then indents all following lines. *This option has no effect on descendant nodes*.

..  @rst-rst
..      Enter rst mode. (Rst mode is the mode of operation discussed in the tutorial.)
..      Create a section if the show_headlines option is True.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.8">**Option doc parts** set rst3 options. Option doc parts start with ``@ @rst-options`` followed by lines of the form ``name=value``. Comment lines starting with ``..`` are allowed. For example::

    @ @rst-options
    .. This comment line is ignored.
    show_headlines=False
    show_leo_directives=False
    verbose=True
    @c

This is a real Leo doc part. Like all other doc parts an option doc part starts with ``@`` and continues until the end of body text or until the next ``@c``.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.9">Settings in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo specify the defaults to be used for all rst3 options.  The form of these settings is::

    @bool rst3_&lt;option name&gt; = True/False
    @string rst3_&lt;option name&gt; = aString

That is, to create a default value for an rst3 setting, you must prefix the option name with ``rst3_``.  For example::

    @bool rst3_write_intermediate_file = True

"I am a huge fan of Leo. I think it's quite possibly the most revolutionary programming tool I have ever used and it (along with the Python language) has utterly changed my view of programming (indeed of writing) forever."---Shakeeb Alireza

"Thank you very much for Leo. I think my way of working with data will change forever... I am certain [Leo] will be a revolution. The revolution is as important as the change from sequential linear organization of a book into a web-like hyperlinked pages. The main concept that impress me is that the source listing isn't the main focus any more. You focus on the non-linear, hierarchical, collapsible outline of the source code."---Korakot Chaovavanich

I feel strongly that Ed Ream, our ever-patient, ever-productive Leo architect deserves a nomination [for the ActiveState OpenSource Award.] Among other reasons, for:

- Delivering the first usable visual literate programming tool.
- Adding a vast abundance of new features.

- Eliminating vast amounts of menial programming labour.
- Tirelessly and patiently supporting users, and catering to a wide range of feature requests.---David McNab

August 28, 2002, on `slashdot`_.

Hello, my full name is David Speed Ream. I am known as Speed to friends and enemies alike, but I gladly answer to David or most any other handle. I am an unabashed and biased fan of Leo, the fact that it was written by my brother Edward only slightly coloring my already colored glasses. I have been testing and using Leo in software production for over 4 years. My company currently has over 50,000 lines of code in over 100 source files that are written using Leo.

My comments are from two points of view, the first being software project manager for a complicated, multi-module software product, and the second being as a production line coder. For me, Leo’s greatest and only real drawback is the learning curve. This learning curve can be shallow is if all that is required is that someone code using Leo. However, in our company we allocate 40 to 80 hours *on top* of the normal coding load for someone to come up to speed on Leo. The ROI (return on investment) is calculated by me to be on the order of 3 months. So if I hire a consultant for less than 3 months, I don’t teach him Leo, even though all source code in our company must reside in Leo files for the reasons I won’t go into now.

I consider that my coders are 15 to 30 percent more efficient in their daily operations than my competition’s people. This indefensible claim of mine is based on the changes in my productivity as Leo grew from a test document production tool to the primary production method for all our assembly, c and cpp source code.

Personally, I hate to deal with documentation when I write code, except:

1) When I am first sitting down to solve a new problem. Then the documentation becomes quite long-winded and pontificatory, as if I were the only one on earth smart enough to solve the problem - or

2) When I come back to code I or someone else has written and find the documentation insufficient to understand the code without study (seems to be most of the time).

So I do not require my engineers or myself to do a great job of documentation, nor do I use Leo for that purpose. Rather, it is Leo’s outlining and organizing ability, and Leo’s ability to create source files from within the outline that give me what I think is a tremendous competitive advantage. Each of my company’s products run on all versions of windows from Win 3.1 to XP. In our flagship software piece, there are ten main modules, and each module is maintained by one single Leo file. In the CODEC module, one Leo file named compress.leo organizes and creates seven .asm files, forty-four .c files, twenty .h files, two .def files, four .mak files, etc. etc. etc. This one file can be checked out from source code control and given to an engineer for the addition of a new feature.

In it are contained all the known issues for the CODEC, each issue arranged in its own clone section. One clone section groups together every routine, variable or type definition that must change between different versions of Windows. These sections could be from six different c source files, two assembly files, and eight .h files. Another clone section groups together those sections relating to memory problems, which change according to the memory configuration and TSR configuration (or lack thereof) on the target machine. Another clone section groups sections that fail (or don’t fail) if the routine in question was accidentally run during the dreaded ‘interrupt time’. Another clone section is a section containing clones, each of which is named after the major bug that was fixed when the engineer who fixed the bug grouped a bunch of routines, definitions, etc. together to fix the bug.

None of the above clone sections was ‘designed’ into the document. Just the opposite happens. When the codec was first written, there was just a single Leo file with a bunch of sections for each c routine or assembly module. As the product grew and was tested on various platforms, each failure of the module was organized into clones each time a failure was fixed. This is what I call “SELF DOCUMENTING CODE”. This has nothing to do with me sitting and documenting anything. Its just that the STRUCTURE of a bug fix (or product enhancement) lives on long after the coding is done, as long as no one is foolish enough to delete the cloned sections that ‘DOCUMENT’ what happened.

In actual practice, this organizational ‘history’ is so powerful that I can’t begin to describe it. A ‘REVERSE LEARNING CURVE’ happens when an engineer gets a Leo file that already has the ‘interrupt time sensitive’ routines grouped together by the last unfortunate soul who had to work on them. There may not be any more written documentation, but the knowledge contained in the structure can be breathtaking. It is certainly time saving. I find this particularly true in my own case. Often I’ll look at some code that seems totally unfamiliar and think ‘what idiot wrote this crap’. Then I’ll look at the version control comments and realize that I wrote the crap. Then for sure I know the documentation is non-existent, but the clones I used to develop it are still there, and they always serve to refresh my memory in an indescribable way.

Enough of this commentary, I just looked at the clock. Best wishes to anyone willing to try Leo for a week. I hope you will be glad you did.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.13">The Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy.

#1 Reason would probably be clone nodes. One node can point to another. Another way of putting this is is that a leaf can be on more than one tree. For example, suppose you have a list of recipes. You simultaneously put a single recipe under multiple categories or even multiple hierarchies. You could put "3 bean enchilada" simultaneously under Recipes-Mexican and Food-Gas. Another example would be, if you are a biologist trying to decide under which genus to put a new species, you could put the species under two simultaneously. In effect, you can build a 3-D tree.


#2 Reason would probably be that Leo outlines can be embedded in external text files. So, a Leo outline is more than an outline, it is a meta-structure that can be added to another text without changing that text, but rather providing an external road map to the text. Microsoft Word has a text (xml) version with a commenting convention, so Leo can even be used to add outlines into Word docs, although it isn't set up to do that now. For example, see http://www.3dtree.com/ev/e/sbooks/leo/sbframetoc_ie.htm In this case, the upper window of Leo is the meta-structure, and the bottom window is the file to which the meta-structure is being applied, viewed one node at a time.

I may not have made #2 very clear, but it is actually a very useful feature. It takes some getting used to before one sees all of the possibilities tho. One way to think of it is that Leo allows you to throw external documents into your outline, and yet the external document remains independent and can still be edited separately.

Some other cool things about Leo which Word doesn't feature:
1. Pure xml output that is easy to transform into other formats (next version of Word will have true XML format, but not as easy to work with). One consequence of this is that Leo files can be transformed pretty easily to web pages with their outlining capability intact.
2. Easy to add features since is programmed in Python and open source. Maybe your average user can't start hacking on it, but a surprising amount can be tacked on...
3. Free, opensource, multi-platform
4. Leo is scriptable with Python. It should be possible to build a Tickler into Leo using Python scripting, for example.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.14">First of all, kudos to you for the excellent progress you've been making with Leo. I upgraded today after about three months of using and older version and I was thrilled to see all the great improvements that have happened so fast. I especially love the ability to go to next clone. I think you're really showing what open source can do and your current trajectory puts you on track to kick Emacs into the dustbin of computing history.

So today I copied all my data (personal information manager and project management stuff) out of my old outliner (ThoughtManager, which syncs with and runs on the Palm) and put it into Leo. It took me hours to do it and then to rearrange it the way I really wanted it. But having the ability to make clones and have different ways to view my data is, as you know, fabulous. In my case, for personal information and project management things, I used the flexibility of clones to allow me to see my data in several different views: 1) by project, the logical hierarchical breakdown by topic, 2) by person, so whenever I'm talking to someone I can easily see all the pending items related to them which may be spread over multiple projects, 3) by priority, so I can see what needs to get done sooner and what can wait for later and, 4) a special case of priority called "Today" for the things I'm going to focus on in the coming hours.

Now here's why I don't miss the ability of my old outliner to sync the entire outline with the Palm. It turns out the main thing I really want in the Palm is the top category "Today" so all I have to do is have Leo flatten that one heading into a text file (and it kindly remembers the name and directory of the file I used last time) and then I'm done because I've told the Palm Hotsync manager that that file should be sent to Palm memo pad every time I sync. The Palm Hotsync manager does a nice job of sending a text file to the Palm memo pad and even breaks the file up into multiple memo records if it's too big to fit in just one. So that gives me enough to be able to browse (or full text search) the small amount of data that I really want right inside my Palm (which is also my cell phone). Quick and dirty but it works.

For times when I want my whole outline with me, Leo wins again because thanks to its cross platform nature I can take my whole outline with me on my Mac iBook, even though I usually edit it on a Windows PC (which is the only kind of machine my old outliner would run on). Quite frankly, although my old outliner was able to shoehorn the whole thing into my palm/cellphone, it was a pain to access it on the small screen and slow processor. Now when I anticipate I'll need the whole thing, for example when I'm going to a meeting, I can put it on my Mac iBook (under X and Fink for now until Python can do it native under Aqua) and have real, full access to it all.

I think now in addition to being great for programming Leo is also a great PIM. Being able to flatten a strategically chosen portion of the outline into a known file name that the Palm sync manager has been told to send to the Palm on every sync does the trick for me. I wonder if you would consider something like an @flatten directive so I can have that done automatically for me every time I save my outline? For now it's up to me to flatten the node I want manually, although once I've done that the transfer to the Palm is automatic.

You're my hero! Thank you so much.

<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.15">Another day, another breakthrough using Leo--now I realize Leo is the best URL bookmark manager there is.  No more bookmarks menus or favorites lists inside the browser for me.  With the @url directive I can just double click on the URL to open it in my browser.  Leo lets me arrange the URLs in a hierarchy (or multiple hierarchies), attach notes to them, save clippings of things I read on the sites.  It's sooo much better than anything the browsers have built in and it lets me easily use different browsers on different platforms and different machines (try that with the browsers' built-in bookmark managers).

When using Leo as a project manager and personal information manager as I do I can heavily annotate every task and project with helpful and relevant URLs.  And since URLs can be of the file:// form, they're not just for web pages or HTML documents;  I can link to any file on my disk of any type to be opened by any program.

Leo is a quantum leap for me in terms of how many projects I can manage and how much information I can find and organize and store in a useful way.  I'm a data-mining army of one now and the web is my playground. Every time I find a web page that has interesting links to others, those links get stored in my Leo outline too, right where I can find them and make practical use of them.  I can easily accept dozens of valuable links every day and integrate them into what I'm doing in a way that I'm confidant they won't get lost or forgotten.  Before I always used to get bogged down by the difficulty of managing bookmarks inside the browser.  But now I'm no longer the victim of information overload buried in the knowledge landslide of the Internet;  instead I'm the professional strip miner with the world's biggest bulldozer.  I eagerly plunge into mountains of data and emerge with all the valuable information nuggets neatly stored and organized.  And my storehouse of knowledge is a flexible thing where I can reorganize and prioritize and massage the data to my heart's content as I learn more about it and decide to use it in different ways for different purposes.  It's the difference between the pick axe and the steam shovel for me.

<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.16">This year my accountant is getting a beautiful printout generated by LaTeX and Leo. I have a complicated tax situation this year, but I got it all laid out and organized in Leo. Then I had each of the nodes that had something my accountant needs to see write the data out to a file in the form a LaTeX table.

Sometimes a row of a table would have a result that was calculated by adding up a list of numbers. For that I used the modern day equivalent of an adding machine paper tape--I stored a lisp s-expression in a Leo comment. I like s-expressions for this because once I put the opening "(+" on one line and the closing ")" on another line, I can fill in additional numbers just by typing them and can even annotate them with comments. So in the middle of generating a LaTeX file I might have something like this::

    @
    (+
    1165.26 1823.70 ; May 2002
    123.38 ; June 2002
    13.50 ; July 2002
    13.21 ; October 2002
    55.25 ; November 2002
    )
    @c

That's an annotated record of how I arrived at the number the accountant will actually see. I can just paste it into any lisp or scheme interpreter and get the total. Adding additional numbers is easy.

For next year, I think I might take this a step further. What I did this year is good for adding up numbers to get a total for one row of a LaTeX table. But it turns out I'd also like some more processing done on those tables (which I had to do by hand this time--I'd like the rows sorted in reverse order by magnitude (so that the big numbers jump out at you from the start of the tables) and I'd like a total of all the rows in the table. So I think next year, instead of having an s-expression that computes the total of one row for me, I think I'll use s-expressions that generate whole tables, formatted for LaTex, from the underlying data. So I'm thinking next year my s-expressions might look more like this::

    @

The job of that "table" function would be to return the LaTeX code needed to display a table with the category names and values, sorted descending by magnitude, with the total displayed. It's sort of a poor man's way of doing a spreadsheet inside Leo and then making it look great using LaTeX. The idea would be as I wanted to add more data, I'd add it to the s-expression and then reevaluate the whole thing by pasting it into a lisp interpreter and then copying the result back into the same Leo node for LaTeX to process.---Dan

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.113">**Question**: It would be nice if Leo could open empty files. I tend to be "document oriented" rather than "application oriented" in my thinking and prefer "create empty file at location -&gt; open it with program" to "start program -&gt; create new file -&gt; save it at location".

**Answer** by Paul Paterson: If you are on Windows 98/2000/XP then the procedure is as follows...

1. Start Leo
2. Click New
3. Click Save as...
4. Save the file as "c:\\windows\\shellnew\\leofile.leo" (or c:\\winnt for 2000/XP)
5. Open regedit "start...run...regedit"
6. Open HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and find the ".leo" extension type
7. Go New ... Key from the context menu 
8. Call the new key ShellNew 
9. Select the new key, right-click, choose New...String Value from the context menu
10. Call it FileName 
11. Double-click on the string, and modify it to be the filename of the leofile.leo file you created, including the extension
12. Exit the registry editor and restart Windows Explorer (you may need to reboot on Windows 98)

Now you should have a New:Leo File option in Explorer. This creates a duplicate of the file you saved. This can be useful because you could make a template Leo file containing some standard nodes_ that you always have and then save this.

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.115" str_atime="1376412852.0">For the most part, docutils_ does a good job of reporting errors. docutils_ prints a message to the console and inserts an unmistakable error message in the generated .html file. **Important**: On Windows it is helpful to `run Leo in a console window`_.

However, in some cases, docutils_ crashes instead of properly reporting the problem. There are several workarounds:

1.  The crashes I have seen arise from the following bug in docutils. **Hyperlinks in image:: markup must be lower case**.  This will work::

        .. .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: faq_

    This will **crash**::

        .. .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: FAQ_

    So avoid this crash by making sure to use lower case targets in ':target:' markup.

2.  You can change the docutils_ source slightly so that it prints a traceback when it crashes. (The rst3 plugin should be able to do this, but I haven't figured out how yet.) It's easy enough to do this:

- Find the file core.py in top-level docutils folder. Typically this folder will be in Python's site-packages folder.

- Open core.py in some editor other than Leo.

- Find the method called report_Exceptions.

- Insert the following lines at the very start of this method::

        print 'EKR: added traceback'
        import traceback ; traceback.print_exc()

This will cause a traceback whenever docutils_ crashes. I have found that such tracebacks are generally enough to locate the general area of the problem. **Note**: These tracebacks go to the console window, so you should `run Leo in a console window`_.

3.  As a last resort, you can isolate syntax errors by reducing your input files until they work again, then adding sections until you get a crash. This is easy enough to do (when using the rst3 plugin) by change a headline 'x' to @rst-ignore-tree x.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.116">.. From: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3240374

Using Leo's File-Export-Flatten Outline commands creates a MORE style outline which places all Leo body sections on the left margin. The headlines_ are indented with tabs which Excel will read as a tab delimited format. Once inside Excel there are benefits.

1. The most obvious benefit inside Excel is that the body sections (Excel first column) can be selected easily and highlighted with a different font color. This makes the MORE format very readable. Save a copy of your sheet as HTML and now you have a web page with the body sections highlighted.

2. It is possible to hide columns in Excel. Hiding the first column leaves just the headlines showing.

3. Formulas based on searching for a string can do calculations in Excel. For example if a heading "Current Assets" appears on level 4 then the body formula::

        =INDEX(A:A,MATCH("Current Assets",D:D,0)+1)

will retrieve it. The +1 after match looks down one row below the matched headline. The trick is to place all your headlines in quotes because Excel will see + "Current Assets" from the MORE outline. When Excel tries without the quotes it thinks it is a range name and displays a #N/A error instead of the headline. Also you must place a child node_ below to get the + sign instead of a - sign which would give a MORE headline of -"Current assets" , also is an error.

I think there is some interesting possibility here because of the enforcement of Leo body text being always in the first column. The Leo outline provides additional reference to organizing the problem not typical of spreadsheet models. Beyond scripting in Python, Excel is good at doing interrelated calculations and detecting problems like circular references. In Excel Tools-Options-General is a setting for r1c1 format which then shows numbers instead of letters for column references. Using this would allow entries like this in the leo body::

    1000
    3500
    =R[-1]C+R[-2]C

In Excel you would see 4500 below those two numbers. This is completely independent of where the block of three cells exists on the sheet.

When I do subsequent passes, I wind up with subnodes that are out of order with the sequence found in the main node_. It's not a big deal, but I like 'em ordered. With just one editor pane, clicking on the node_ to move would switch focus to that node_. I'd then need to re-focus on the main node_. A minor nuisance, but it does slow you down.

My solution is to open a second editor with its focus on the main node_. Switch to the other editor, and, referring to the first editor pane, move the nodes as you like. The second editor's pane will change focus to the node_ you're moving, but the first editor will stay focused on the main node_. It's a lot easier to do than to describe!

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.12">Use @clean or @auto unless everyone in your work group uses Leo.  In that case, using @file is best.

Leo's repository contains **reference** .leo files. These reference files should contain nothing but @file nodes. Reference files should change only when new external files get added to the project.

Leo's `git repository`_ and Leo distributions contain the following reference files: LeoPyRef.leo, LeoPluginsRef.leo and leoGuiPluginsRef.leo. Developers should use local copies of reference files for their own work. For example, instead of using LeoPyRef.leo directly, I use a copy called LeoPy.leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.120">One way is to link directly to the media file from a Leo node_ (with @url) and write a script button to wrap all URL-nodes under the current node_ in a single HTML page. Then, you can view your media in two ways:

- Individually. You can directly click on the @url link to display the media in the browser (assuming you have your MIME/filetype associations set up correctly for your browser).

- In a group. You can click on a script button (you have to code this yourself, very simple) which should collect all @url nodes_ under the current node_ and dynamically generate a HTML page displaying either links to or embedded versions of the media (using the HTML trick described above to invoke the browser). This way, you can create collections of @url nodes under a single node_ (like a bookmark folder), and press a single button to view the @url collection as a single entity in the browser (with all browser capabilities like displaying the media).

You could probably generalize this idea of "collect all @url nodes under current node_ and display as HTML in browser" into a general-purpose plugin. However, the plugin would have to be somewhat smart in mapping a link to its corresponding HTML code (e.g. an image link gets mapped to an &lt;img&gt; HTML tag, a link to a Flash file gets mapped to an &lt;embed&gt; tag, etc).

If you intend to use Leo for programming, read the `tutorial about programming`_, then look at Leo's source code in the file LeoPy.leo. Spend 5 or 10 minutes browsing through the outline. Don't worry about details; just look for the following common usage patterns:

- The (Projects) tree shows how to use clones to represent tasks.

- Study @file leoNodes.py. It shows how to define more than one class in single file.

- Most other files show how to use a single @others directive to define one class.

- Most methods are defined using @others, *not* section definition nodes.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.20">Here is a posting which might be helpful: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2300457 The @first directive_ is the key to output usable code in unsupported languages. For example, to use Leo with the Basic language, use the following::

    @first $IFDEF LEOHEADER
    @delims '
    @c
    $ENDIF

So this would enable a basic compiler to "jump" over the "true" Leo-header-lines. Like this::

    $IFDEF LEOHEADER &lt;-conditional compilation directive 
    #@+leo-ver=4 &lt;-these lines not compiled
    #@+node:@file QParser005.INC
    #@@first
    #@delims ' 
    '@@c
    $ENDIF &lt;-... Until here!
    &lt;rest of derived code file ... &gt;

This changes the comment symbol the apostrophe, making comments parseable by a BASIC (or other language.)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.21">Use the @first directive_ in @file or @clean trees. The @first directive puts lines at the very start of files derived from @file. For example, the body text of @file spam.py might be::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python

The body text of @file foo.pl might be::

    @first #/usr/bin/perl

Leo recognizes the @first directive_ only at the start of the body text of @file nodes. No text may precede @first directives_. More than one @first directive may exist, like this::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python
    @first # more comments.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.24">No. Everything in an @file trees must be part of the external file: orphan and @ignore nodes are invalid in @file trees. This restriction should not be troublesome. For example, you can organize your outline like this::

    + myClass
    ..+ ignored stuff
    ..+ @file myClass

(As usual, + denotes a headline.) So you simply create a new node_, called myClass, that holds your @file trees and stuff you don't want in the @file trees.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.25">By Rich Ries. Some older C compilers don't understand the "//" comment symbol, so using @language C won't work. Moreover, the following does not always work either::

    @comment /* */

This generates the following sentinel line::

    /*@@comment /* */*/

in the output file, and not all C compilers allow nested comments, so the last \*\/ generates an error. The solution is to use::

    #if 0
    @comment /* */
    #endif

Leo is happy: it recognizes the @comment directive_. The C compiler is happy: the C preprocessor strips out the offending line before the C compiler gets it.

    Notes:How To:How to add support for a new language section.

This section contains clones of all relevant parts of Leo that you will change. Coming in Leo 4.4: Leo will use JEdit's language description files to drive the syntax colorer. To add support for a new language, just add another such description file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.30" str_atime="1376412828.0">You have two options: 

- Get git write access, and add the @file file to the plugins directory.

- Just send the @file file to me at edreamleo@gmail.com.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.4">You will lose much of Leo's power if you don't use clones. See `Clones`_ and `Views`_ for full details.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.7">Use methods for any code that is used (called or referenced) more than once.

Sections_ are convenient in the following circumstances:

- When you want to refer to snippets of code the can not be turned into methods. For example, many plugins start with the code like this::

    &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; version history &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; globals &gt;&gt;

    None of these sections could be replaced by methods.

- When you want to refer to a snippet of code that shares local variables with the enclosing code. This is surprisingly easy and safe to do, *provided* the section is used only in one place. `Section names`_ in such contexts can be clearer than method names.  For example::

    &lt;&lt; init ivars for writing &gt;&gt;

In short, I create sections when convenient, and convert them to functions or methods if they need to be used in several places.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.74">The Import Files dialog allows you to select multiple files provided you are running Python 2.3 or above. There is also an importFiles script in LeoPy.leo.  You can use that script as follows::

    import leo.core.leoImport as leoImport
    leoImport.importFiles(aDirectory, ".py")

This will import all .py files from aDirectory, which should be a full path to a particular directory. You could use ".c" to import all .c files, etc.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.76" str_atime="1376412985.0"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.77">Just `run Leo in a console window`_. At the point you want to drop into the debugger, execute this line::

    g.pdb()

All output from pdb goes to stdout, which is the console window. It would be good to create a subclass of pdb.Pdb that uses Leo's log pane rather than a console window, but I haven't done that. It could be done easily enough in a plugin...

**Important**: I recommend using g.trace instead of pdb.  For example::

    g.trace(x)

prints the name of the function or method containing the trace, and the value of
x. g.callers is often useful in combination with g.trace. g.callers(5)
returns the last 5 entries of the call stack. For example::

    g.trace(x,g.callers(5))

Used this way, g.trace shows you patterns that will be invisible using pdb.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.9">Internally, Leo represents all strings as unicode. Leo translates from a particular encoding to Unicode_ when reading .leo files or external files. Leo translates from Unicode_ to a particular encoding when writing external files. You may see strange looking characters if your text editor is expecting a different encoding. The encoding used in any external file is shown in the #@+leo sentinel line like this::

    #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

**Exception**: the encoding is UTF-8 if no -encoding= field exists. You can also use the @encoding directive_ to set the encoding for individual external files. If no @encoding directive_ is in effect, Leo uses the following settings_ to translate to and from unicode:

default_derived_file_encoding
    The encoding used for external files if no @encoding directive_ is in effect.
    This setting also controls the encoding of files that Leo writes.
    The default is UTF-8 (case not important).

new_leo_file_encoding
    The encoding specified in the following line of new .leo files::

        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"&gt;

    The default is UTF-8 (upper case for compatibility for old versions of Leo).

<t tx="ekr.20050830120844" str_atime="1376412842.0">c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable will append items to the end of an existing menu. For example, the following script will add a new item at the end of the 'File' menu::

    def callback(*args,**keys):
        g.trace()

    table = (("Test1",None,callback),)

    c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable('File',table)

Plugins can do anything with menus using c.frame.menu.getMenu. For example, here is a script that adds a Test menu item after the 'Open With' menu item in the File menu::

    def callback(*args,**keys):
        g.trace()

    fileMenu = c.frame.menu.getMenu('File')

# 3 is the position in the menu.  Other kinds of indices are possible::

    fileMenu.insert(3,'command',label='Test2',command=callback)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830120857">The trick is to create a workflow that separates editing from testing. Putting test code in LeoPy.leo would waste a lot of time. To run tests you would have to exit Leo and reload LeoPy.leo. A much quicker way is to put all test code in a test.leo file. So to change and test code, do the following:

1. Save LeoPy.leo but do **not** exit Leo.

2. Quit the copy of Leo running test.leo, then reload test.leo.

3. Run test scripts from test.leo.

That's all. Python will recompile any changed .py files in the new copy of Leo. **Note**: I create a batch file called t.bat that runs test.leo, so to the "edit-reload-test" cycle is just:

1. Control-S (in LeoPy.leo: saves the .leo file)
2. t (in a console window: runs test.leo, compiling all changed .py files as a side effect)
3. Control-E (in test.leo: runs the test script)

The benefits of the new workflow:

- test.leo loads  _much_ more quickly than LeoPy.leo does. This new approach can increase the speed of the edit-reload-test cycle by more than a factor of 10. Hitting Control-S, t, Control-E takes about 5 seconds.

- LeoPy.leo runs with the *old* code, so it is much easier to fix syntax errors or exceptions in the *new* code: just fix the problem and save LeoPy.leo *without* closing LeoPy.leo, then restart test.leo. You run your tests on the new code, but you edit the new code with the old, stable code.

- test.leo is the perfect place to develop test. I can create and organize those tests and when I am done, ''test.leo'' is a log of my work.

<t tx="ekr.20050901084134">I wrote this soon after discovering Python in 2001. The conclusions are still valid today.
    
I've known for a while that Python was interesting; I attended a Python conference last year and added Python support to Leo. But last week I got that Python is something truly remarkable. I wanted to convert Leo from wxWindows to wxPython, so I began work on c2py, a Python script that would help convert from C++ syntax to Python. While doing so, I had an Aha experience. Python is more than an incremental improvement over Smalltalk or C++ or objective-C; it is "something completely different". The rest of this post tries to explain this difference.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.2">What struck me first as I converted C++ code to Python is how much less blah, blah, blah there is in Python. No braces, no stupid semicolons and most importantly, *no declarations*. No more pointless distinctions between const, char \*, char const \*, char \* and wxString. No more wondering whether a variable should be signed, unsigned, short or long.

Declarations add clutter, declarations are never obviously right and declarations don't prevent memory allocation tragedies. Declarations also hinder prototyping. In C++, if I change the type of something I must change all related declarations; this can be a huge and dangerous task. With Python, I can change the type of an object without changing the code at all! It's no accident that Leo's new log pane was created first in Python.

Functions returning tuples are a "minor" feature with a huge impact on code clarity. No more passing pointers to data, no more defining (and allocating and deallocating) temporary structs to hold multiple values.

.. _`pylint`: http://www.logilab.org/857

Python can't check declarations because there aren't any. However, there is a really nifty tool called `pylint`_ that does many of the checks typically done by compilers.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.3">Python is much more powerful than C++, not because Python has more features, but because Python needs *less* features. Some examples:

- Python does everything that the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) does, without any of the blah, blah, blah needed by STL. No fuss, no muss, no code bloat.

- Python's slicing mechanism is very powerful and applies to any sequence (string, list or tuple). Python's string library does more with far less functions because slices replace many functions typically found in other string libraries.

- Writing dict = {} creates a dictionary (hash table). Hash tables can contain anything, including lists and other hash tables.

- Python's special functions,  __init__, __del__, __repr__, __cmp__, etc. are an elegant way to handle any special need that might arise.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.4">Before using Python I never fully realized how difficult and dangerous memory allocation is in C++. Try doing::

        aList[i:j] = list(aString)

in C.  You will write about 20 lines of C code. Any error in this code will create a memory allocation crash or leak.

Python is fundamentally safe. C++ is fundamentally unsafe. When I am using Python I am free from worry and anxiety. When I am using C++ I must be constantly "on guard." A momentary lapse can create a hard-to-find pointer bug. With Python, almost nothing serious can ever go wrong, so I can work late at night, or after a beer. The Python debugger is always available. If an exception occurs, the debugger/interpreter tells me just what went wrong. I don't have to plan a debugging strategy! Finally, Python recovers from exceptions, so Leo can keep right on going even after a crash!
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.5">Python has almost all the speed of C. Other interpretive environments such as icon and Smalltalk have clarity, power and safety similar to Python. What makes Python unique is its seamless way of making C code look like Python code. Python executes at essentially the speed of C code because most Python modules are written in C. The overhead in calling such modules is negligible. Moreover, if code is too slow, one can always create a C module to do the job.

In fact, Python encourages optimization by moving to higher levels of expression. For example, Leo's Open command reads an XML file. If this command is too slow I can use Python's XML parser module. This will speed up Leo while at the same time raising the level of the code.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.6">Little of Python is completely new. What stands out is the superb engineering judgment evident in Python's design. Python is extremely powerful, yet small, simple and elegant. Python allows me to express my intentions clearly and at the highest possible level.

The only hope of making Leo all it can be is to use the best possible tools. I believe Python will allow me to add, at long last, the new features that Leo should have.

Edward K. Ream, October 25, 2001.  P.S., September, 2005:

Four years of experience have only added to my admiration for Python. Leo could
not possibly be what it is today without Python.

<t tx="ekr.20050902105852">Leo grew out of my efforts to use Donald Knuth's "CWEB system of Structured documentation." I had known of literate programming since the mid 1980's, but I never understood how to make it work for me. In November 1995 I started thinking about programming in earnest. Over the holidays I mused about making programs more understandable. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.1">In January 1996 the fog of confusion suddenly cleared. I summarized my thinking with the phrase, **web are outlines in disguise**. I suspected that outline views were the key to programming, but many details remained obscure.

March 5, 1996, is the most important date in Leo's history. While returning from a day of skiing, I discussed my thoughts with Rebecca. During that conversation I realized that I could use the MORE outliner as a prototype for a "programming outliner." I immediately started work on my first outlined program. It quickly became apparent that outlines work: all my old problems with programming vanished. The @others directive dates from this day. I realized that MORE's outlines could form the basis for Leo's screen design. Rather than opening body text within the outline, as MORE does, I decided to use a separate body pane.

I hacked a translator called M2C which allowed me to use MORE to write real code. I would write code in MORE, copy the text to the clipboard in MORE format, then run M2C, which would convert the outline into C code. This process was useful, if clumsy. I called the language used in the outline SWEB, for simplified CWEB. Much later Leo started supporting the noweb language.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.10">Leo 4.1 Final went out the door February 20, 2004. This release reorganized the code base to support gui's other than tkinter.

Leo first used gnx's (global node indices) as a foolproof way of associating nodes in .leo files with nodes in external files. At the time, there was still intense discussions about protecting the logical consistency of outlines. @thin was later to solve all those problems, but nobody knew that then.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.11">Leo 4.2 Final was released September 20, 2004.  This is one of the most significant dates in Leo's history. There were so many significant changes that it is hard to remember what Leo was like before it.

Leo 4.2 eliminated worries about consistency of outlines and external files: Leo recreates all essential information from @thin files, so *there is nothing left in the .leo file to get out of sync*. Thin external files use gnx's extensively. This simplifies the file format and makes thin external files more cvs friendly.
  
Leo 4.2 forms the **great divide** in Leo's internal data structures. Before 4.2, Leo every node in the outline had its own vnode. This was a big performance problem: clone operations had to traverse the entire outline! 4.2 represents clones by sharing subtrees. Kent Tenney and Bernhard Mulder made absolutely crucial contributions. Kent pointed out that it is a tnode, not a vnode that must form the root of the shared data. Bernhard showed that iterators avoid creating huge numbers of positions.

::

    The debut of @all, @test and @suite
    The mod_scripting plugin creates script buttons
    A much faster and more robust spell checker plugin
    Leo saves t.unknownAttributes in the root nodes of @thin trees
    New iterators</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.12">Leo 4.3 final was released May 23, 2005.  This release introduced settings files. These files replaced config.txt and made settings completely extensible and flexible. This release also introduced the ill-fated settings pane. It was soon retired because it inhibited development.

::

    Leo stores recent files in .leoRecentFiles.txt files
    Added PluginsManager plugin
    Support for extensions in the leo/extensions directory
    Leo predefines c, g and p in scripts and @test nodes
    
Leo 4.3.3 final went out the door September 17, 2005.  It added the rst3 plugin.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.2">Throughout 1996 I created a version of Leo on the Macintosh in plain C and the native Mac Toolbox. This was a poor choice; I wasted a huge amount of time programming with these primitive tools. However, this effort convinced me that Leo was a great way to program.

Late in 1997 I wrote a Print command to typeset an outline. Printing (Weaving) is supposedly a key feature of literate programming. Imagine my surprise when I realized that such a "beautiful" program listing was almost unintelligible; all the structure inherent in the outline was lost! I saw clearly that typesetting, no matter how well done, is no substitute for explicit structure.

In 1998 I created a version of Leo using Apple's YellowBox environment. Alas, Apple broke its promises to Apple developers. I had to start again.

<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.3">In May of 1999 I began work on the Borland version of Leo for Windows. Borland C++ was much better than CodeWarrior C, but it was still C++. Still, the Borland Delphi classes were a pleasure to use and free of bugs. I redesigned Leo's file format for the Windows version of Leo; the Yellow Box file format was a binary format that requires the Yellow Box runtime.

There are two significant problems with the Borland version of Leo. First, it works only on Windows. Second, it can never be Open software, because it uses Borland's Delphi classes and a commercial syntax coloring component.

This version of Leo was the first version to use xml as the format of .leo files. Marc-Antoine Parent urged me to use XML and patiently explained how to use XML properly. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.4">I attended the Python conference in early 2001. In May of 2000 I began work on an wxWindows version of Leo. This did not work out, but something good did come from this effort. I spent a lot of time adding Python scripting to the wxWindows code and I became familiar with Python and its internals.

I really started to 'get' Python in September 2001. I wrote the white papers at about this time. Python solved *all* my programming problems. I rewrote Leo in Python in about two months! For the first time in my career I was no longer anxious while programming; it simply isn't possible to create bad bugs in Python. The Python version of Leo was the first officially OpenSoftware version of Leo. The first functional version of Leo in Python was 0.05 alpha, December 17, 2001.

In October of 2001 I began work on the leo.py, an Open Software version of leo.py, a version of Leo written in Python and Tk.  At last I have found the proper platform for Leo.  leo.py naturally supports scripting in Python.  The combination of Python and Tk is incredibly powerful, very easy to use, and truly cross platform.  I rewrote Leo in Python in about two months!  For the first time in my career I no longer am anxious while programming; it simply isn't possible to create bad bugs in Python.

Tk was officially retired in June 2011.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.5">I registered the Leo project on SourceForge on March 10, 2003. Leo started a new life shortly thereafter. Prior to SourceForge my interest in Leo had been waning.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.6">In the summer of 2001 I began to consider using sentinel lines in external files. Previously I had thought that outline structure must be 'protected' by remaining inside .leo files. Accepting the possibility that sentinels might be corrupted opened vast new design possibilities. In retrospect, problems with sentinels almost never happen, but that wasn't obvious at the time! The result of this design was known then as Leo2. That terminology is extinct. I think of this version as the first version to support @file and automatic tangling and untangling.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.7">The biggest surprise in Leo's history was the realization it is **much** easier to untangle files derived from @file. Indeed, the old tangle code created all sorts of problems that just disappear when using @file. The new Python version of Leo became fully operational in early 2002. It was probably about this time that I chose noweb as Leo's preferred markup language. My decision not to support noweb's escape sequences made Leo's read code much more robust.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.8">I spent 2002 taking advantages of Python's tremendous power and safety. Many improvements were at last easy enough to do:

- Nested @others directives appeared in 3.2.
- Unicode support started in 3.3.
- @first and @last appeared in 3.7
- @asis and @nosent appeared in 3.8.
- Incremental syntax coloring and incremental undo appeared in 3.9.
- Paul Paterson created Leo's plugin architecture sometime during this period.
- 3.12 fixed a huge memory leak.
- 3.12 Final, the last 3.x version, appeared July 17, 2003.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.9">In late 2002 and throughout 2003 I worked on an entirely new file format. 4.0 final went out the door October 17, 2003.

Version 4.0 is a major advance in Leo's error handling. Using 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions. The new read code makes no changes to the outline until it is known that no read errors have occurred.

This was a time of intense design work trying to improve error recovery scheme used while reading external files. In the summer of 2003 I realized that orphan and @ignore'd nodes must be prohibited in @file trees. With this restriction, Leo could finally recreate @file trees in outlines using **only** the information in external files. This made the read code much more robust, and eliminated all the previous unworkable error recovery schemes. At last Leo was on a completely firm foundation.

Leo's read code now writes a message to the log pane whenever it sees that the body text in the external file does not match the body text in the outline. These messages do not indicate errors, only that the body text has been changed outside of Leo.

Leo's read code now warns if any non-empty node is unvisited. This check, and the check that headlines match pretty much guarantees that out-of-sync outlines will generate errors. Thus, there is no need a gnx timestamp in @+leo sentinels!

::

    - Added support for uA's
    - Eliminated child indices, extraneous blank lines and @body sentinels
    - Eliminated @node sentinels
    - New @nl and @nonl sentinels
    - Read errors leave the outline completely unchanged
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903074833">Plugins and other scripts can register event handlers (also known as hooks)::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("after-create-leo-frame",onCreate)
    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle) 
    leoPlugins.registerHandler(("start2","open2","command2"), create_open_with_menu) 

As shown above, a plugin may register one or more event handlers with a single call to leoPlugins.registerHandler. Once a hook is registered, Leo will call the registered function' at the named **hook time**. For example::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle)

causes Leo to call on_idle at "idle" time.

Event handlers must have the following signature::

    def myHook (tag, keywords):
        whatever

- tag is the name of the hook (a string).
- keywords is a Python dictionary containing additional information. The following section describes the contents of the keywords dictionary in detail.

**Important**: hooks should get the proper commander this way::

    c = keywords.get('c')
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903074833.1">The following table tells about each event handler: its name, when it is called,
and the additional arguments passed to the hook in the keywords dictionary.
For some kind of hooks, Leo will skip its own normal processing if the hook
returns anything *other* than None. The table indicates such hooks with 'yes' in
the 'Stop?' column.

**Important**: Ever since Leo 4.2, the v, old_v and new_v keys in
the keyword dictionary contain *positions*, not vnodes. These keys are
deprecated. The new_c key is also deprecated. Plugins should use the c key instead.

============================= ======== =================================== =============================

**Notes**:

1.  'activate' and 'deactivate' hooks have been removed because they do not work as expected.

2.  'commands' hooks: The label entry in the keywords dict contains the
    'canonicalized' form of the command, that is, the lowercase name of the command
    with all non-alphabetic characters removed.
    Commands hooks now set the label for undo and redo commands 'undo' and 'redo'
    rather than 'cantundo' and 'cantredo'.

3.  'menu1' hook: Setting g.app.realMenuNameDict in this hook is an easy way of
    translating menu names to other languages. **Note**: the 'new' names created this
    way affect only the actual spelling of the menu items, they do *not* affect how
    you specify shortcuts settings, nor do they affect the 'official'
    command names passed in g.app.commandName. For example::

        app().realMenuNameDict['Open...'] = 'Ouvre'.

4.  'open1' and 'open2' hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing the following entries:

    - c:          The commander of the newly opened window.
    - old_c:      The commander of the previously open window.
    - new_c:      (deprecated: use 'c' instead) The commander of the newly opened window.
    - fileName:   The name of the file being opened.

    You can use old_c.p and c.p to get the current position in the old and new windows.
    Leo calls the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks only if the file is not already open. Leo
    will also call the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks if: a) a file is opened using the
    Recent Files menu and b) the file is not already open.

5.  '@url1' and '@url2' hooks are only executed if the 'icondclick1' hook returns None.

6.  These hooks are useful for testing.

7.  These hooks allow plugins to parse and handle markup within doc parts,
    comments and Python ''' strings. Note that these hooks are *not* called in
    Python ''' strings. See the color_markup plugin for a complete example of how to
    use these hooks.

8.  Leo calls the 'create-optional-menus' hook when creating menus. This hook need
    only create new menus in the correct order, without worrying about the placement
    of the menus in the menu bar. See the plugins_menu and scripts_menu plugins for
    examples of how to use this hook.

9.  The New command calls 'new'.
    The 'new_c' key is deprecated.  Use the 'c' key instead.

10. g.scanDirectives calls 'scan-directives' hook.
    g.scanDirectives returns a dictionary, say d.
    d.get('pluginsList') is an a list of tuples (d,v,s,k) where:

    - d is the spelling of the @directive, without the leading @.
    - v is the vnode containing the directive, _not_ the original vnode.
    - s[k:] is a string containing whatever follows the @directive.
      k has already been moved past any whitespace that follows the @directive.

    See the add_directives plugins directive for a complete example of how to use
    the 'scan-directives' hook.

11. g.app.closeLeoWindow calls the 'close-frame' hook just before
    removing the window from g.app.windowList. The hook code may remove the window
    from app.windowList to prevent g.app.closeLeoWindow from destroying the window.

12. Leo calls the 'headkey1' and 'headkey2' when the headline *might* have changed.

13. p is the new node (position) containing '@auto filename.ext'

14. New in Leo 4.10: the d argument to the open-with event handlers is a python
    dictionary whose keys are all the tags specified by the user in the body of the
    @openwith node.

    pair: Script Button; Tutorial
    pair: @button Node; Tutorial

@button nodes create **script buttons** in Leo's icon area.

Each @button node also creates a corresponding minibuffer command.

Pressing the script button (or executing the command from the minibuffer) applies the script in the @button node to the presently selected outline node.

Script buttons **bring scripts to outlines** a powerful pattern. Creating an @button script should be your first thought whenever you want to automate any task.

- The mod_scripting.py plugins must be enabled to create @button nodes.

- Script buttons execute the **present** body text of the @button node. You can modify a script button's script at any time.

- You can bind keys to the commands created by script buttons::

    @button my-button @key=Alt-8

- Right-clicking a script button deletes it.

This chapter discusses the plugins contained in leoPlugins.leo. These plugins are part of Leo's official distribution. The next chapter, `Writing Plugins`_, tells how to write plugins.

The scripting plugin (mod_scripting.py) deserves special mention. This plugin lets you create **script buttons** in a matter of seconds. See `Using @button nodes`_. Script buttons are extraordinarily useful.

<t tx="ekr.20060105214753">Leo now allows you to specify input modes. You enter mode x with the enter-x-mode command. The purpose of a mode is to create different bindings for keys within a mode. Often plain keys are useful in input modes.

You can specify modes with @mode nodes in leoSettings.leo. @mode nodes work just like @shortcuts nodes, but in addition they have the side effect of creating the enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode command.

Notes:

- You can exit any mode using the keyboard-quit (Control-g) command. This is the **only** binding that is automatically created in each mode. All other bindings must be specified in the @mode node. In particular, the bindings specified in @shortcuts nodes are **not** in effect in mode (again, except for the keyboard-quit binding).

- Leo supports something akin to tab completion within modes: if you type a key that isn't bound in a mode a 'Mode' tab will appear in the log pane. This tab shows all the keys that you can type and the commands to which they are bound. The mode-help command does the same thing.

- @shortcuts nodes specify the bindings for what might be called the 'top-level' mode. These are the bindings in effect when no internal state is present, for example, just after executing the keyboard-quit command.

- The top_level_unbound_key_action setting determines what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode. Leo ignores unbound keys in all other modes. The possibilities are 'insert', 'replace' and 'ignore'.

- The set-insert-mode, set-overwrite-mode and set-ignore-mode commands alter what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode.
  
- If the @mode headline contains ::, everything following the :: is the mode prompt. For example::
    
    @mode abc :: xyz
    
Creates the enter-abc-mode command, but the prompt for the command is xyz.

With all these options it should be possible to emulate the keyboard behavior of any other editor.

<t tx="ekr.20060111192108">A **dangerous** delete is a deletion of a node so that all the data in the node is deleted *everywhere* in an outline. The data is gone, to be retrieved only via undo or via backups. It may not be obvious which deletes are dangerous in an outline containing clones. Happily, there is a very simple rule of thumb::

    Deleting a non-cloned node is *always* dangerous.
    Deleting a cloned node is *never* dangerous.

We could also consider a delete to be dangerous **if it results in a node being omitted from an external file.** This can happen as follows. Suppose we have the following outline (As usual, A' indicates that A is marked with a clone mark)::

    - @file spam.py
        - A'
            - B
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B

Now suppose we clone B, and move the clone so the tree looks like this::

    - @file spam.py
        - A'
            - B'
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B'
        - B'

If (maybe much later), we eliminate B' as a child of A will get::

    - @file spam.py
        - A'
    - Projects
        - A'
        - B

B has not been destroyed, but B is gone from @file spam.py! So in this sense deleting a clone node can also be called dangerous.

<t tx="ekr.20060329101442">Missing modules can cause installation problems. If the installer doesn't work (or puts up a dialog containing no text), you may install Leo from the .zip file as described at `How to install Leo on Windows`_. However you are installing Leo, be sure to `run Leo in a console window`_. because as a last resort Leo prints error messages to the console.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060430220749">The jEdit_ editor drives its syntax colorer using xml **language description files.** Rather than using the xml language description files directly, Leo uses Python **colorer control files**, created automatically from the xml files by a script called jEdit2Py.  All these files reside in the leo/modes directory.

These Python files contain all the information in the jEdit's xml files, so we can (loosely) speak of modes, rulesets, rules, properties and attributes in the Python colorer control files. Later sections of this documentation will make this loose correspondence exact.

`jEdit's documentation`_ contain a complete description of these xml files. Each xml file describes one **colorizing mode**. A mode consists of one or more **rulesets**, and each ruleset consists of a list of **colorizing rules**. In addition, modes, rulesets and rules may have associated **properties** and **attributes**. Various rules may specify that the colorizer uses another ruleset (either in the same mode or another mode).

**Important**: jEdit's xml language description files contain no explicit &lt;RULE&gt; elements Rules are simply sub-elements of an enclosing &lt;RULES&gt; element. The element indicates the kind of rule that is specified, for example, &lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;SEQ&gt;, etc. By the term **rule element** we shall mean any sub-element of the &lt;RULES&gt; element.

**Important**: throughout this documentation, **x.py** will refer to the Python colorer for language x, and **x.xml** will refer to the corresponding xml language-description file.

Using Python colorer control files has the following advantages:

- Running jEdit2Py need only be done when x.xml changes, and the speed of the xml parser in jEdit2Py does not affect the speed of Leo's colorizer in any way. Moreover, the jEdit2Py script can contain debugging traces and checks.

- Colorer control files are valid .py files, so all of Python's import optimizations work as usual. In particular, all the data in colorer control files is immediately accessible to Leo's colorer.

- Colorer control files are easier for humans to understand and modify than the equivalent xml file. Furthermore, it is easy to insert debugging information into Python colorer control files.

- It is easy to modify the Python colorer control files 'by hand' without changing the corresponding xml file. In particular, it would be easy to define entirely new kinds of pattern-matching rules in Python merely by creating functions in a colorer control file.

Controlling Syntax Coloring
###########################

This chapter discusses the settings to control Leo's syntax colorer. This chapter also discusses how to extend Leo's colorizer by creating xml language descriptions files and corresponding Python files. **Important**: this material is for those who want to support Leo's colorizing code. To use Leo's colorizers you only need to know about syntax-coloring settings.

<t tx="ekr.20060502084233">When Leo's syntax colorer sees the '@language x' directive, it will import x.py from Leo's modes folder. The colorer can then access any module-level object obj in x.py as x.obj.

Colorizer control files contain **rules functions** corresponding to rule elements in x.xml. The colorizer can call these functions as if they were members of the colorizer class by passing 'self' as the first argument of these functions. I call these rules *functions* to distinguish them from the corresponding **rules methods** which are actual methods of the colorizer class. Rules *functions* merely call corresponding rules *methods*. Indeed, rules functions are simply a way of binding values to keyword arguments of rules methods. These keywords arguments correspond to the xml attributes of rule elements in x.xml.

The colorizer calls rules functions until one matches, at which point a range of text gets colored and the process repeats. The inner loop of the colorizer is this code::

    for f in self.rulesDict.get(s[i],[]):
        n = f(self,s,i)
        if n &gt; 0:
            i += n ; break
        else: i += 1

- rulesDict is a dictionary whose keys are rulesets and whose values are ruleset dictionaries.
  Ruleset dictionaries have keys that are single characters and whose values are
  the list of rules that can start with that character. 

- s is the full text to be colorized.

- i is the position within s is to be colorized.

Rules methods (and functions) return n &gt; 0 if they match, and n == 0 if they fail.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502084233.1">The following sections describe the top-level data in x.py.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516">**x.properties** is a Python dictionary corresponding to the &lt;PROPS&gt; element in x.xml. Keys are property names; values are strings, namely the contents of &lt;PROPERTY&gt; elements in x.xml. x.properties contains properties for the entire mode. That is, only modes have &lt;PROPS&gt; elements. For example, here is x.properties in php.py::

    # properties for mode php.xml
    properties = {
        "commentEnd": "--&gt;",
        "commentStart": "&lt;!--",
        "indentCloseBrackets": "}",
        "indentOpenBrackets": "{",
        "lineUpClosingBracket": "true",
    }
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516.1">x.py contains a **keyword dictionary** for each ruleset in x.xml. x.py contains an empty keywords dictionary if a ruleset contains no &lt;KEYWORDS&gt; element.

Keys are strings representing keywords of the language describe by the mode. Values are strings representing syntactic categories, i.e. a TYPE attribute valid in x.xml, namely: COMMENT1, COMMENT2, COMMENT3, COMMENT4, FUNCTION, KEYWORD1, KEYWORD2, KEYWORD3, KEYWORD4, LABEL, LITERAL1, LITERAL2, LITERAL3, LITERAL4, MARKUP, NULL and OPERATOR.

For example, here (parts of) some keyword dictionaries in php.py::

    # Keywords dict for mode php::PHP
    php_PHP_keywords_dict = {
        "COM_invoke": "keyword2",
        "COM_load": "keyword2",
        "__CLASS__": "keyword3",
        ...
        "abs": "keyword2",
        "abstract": "keyword1",
        "accept_connect": "keyword2",
        ...
    }

    # Keywords dict for mode php::JAVASCRIPT_PHP
    php_JAVASCRIPT_PHP_keywords_dict = {}

    # Keywords dict for mode php::PHPDOC
    php_PHPDOC_keywords_dict = {
        "@abstract": "label",
        "@access": "label",
        "@author": "label",
        ...
        "@var": "label",
        "@version": "label",
    }

x.py also contains **x.keywordsDictDict**. Keys are ruleset names, values are keywords dictionaries. Here is keywordsDictDict for php.py::

    # Dictionary of keywords dictionaries for php mode.
    keywordsDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": php_javascript_keywords_dict,
        "php_javascript_php": php_javascript_php_keywords_dict,
        "php_main": php_main_keywords_dict,
        "php_php": php_php_keywords_dict,
        "php_php_literal": php_php_literal_keywords_dict,
        "php_phpdoc": php_phpdoc_keywords_dict,
        "php_tags": php_tags_keywords_dict,
        "php_tags_literal": php_tags_literal_keywords_dict,
    }

The colorizer can get the keywords dictionary for a ruleset as follows::

    keywordsDict = x.keywordsDictDict(rulesetName)

**Note**: The jEdit2Py script creates 'friendly' names for keyword dictionaries *solely* as an aid for people reading the code. Leo's colorer uses only the name x.keywordsDictDict; Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of keywords dictionaries such as php_PHPDOC_keywords_dict.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516.2">x.py contains one **rule function** for every rule in every ruleset (&lt;RULES&gt; element) in x.xml. These rules have names rule1 through  ruleN, where N is the total number of rules in all rulesets in x.xml.

Each rules *function* merely calls a rules *method* in Leo's colorizer. Which method gets called depends on the corresponding element in `x.xml`. For example, the first rule in php.xml is::

    &lt;SPAN TYPE="MARKUP" DELEGATE="PHP"&gt;
		&lt;BEGIN&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/BEGIN&gt;
		&lt;END&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/END&gt;
	&lt;/SPAN&gt;

and the corresponding rule function is::

    def php_rule0(colorer, s, i):
        return colorer.match_span(s, i, kind="markup", begin="&lt;?php", end="?&gt;",
            at_line_start=False, at_whitespace_end=False, at_word_start=False,
            delegate="PHP",exclude_match=False,
            no_escape=False, no_line_break=False, no_word_break=False)


php_rule0 calls colorer.match_span because the corresponding xml rule is a &lt;SPAN&gt; element.

For each ruleset, x.py also contains a **rules dictionary**, a Python dictionary whose keys are characters and whose values are all lists of rules functions that that can match the key. For example::

    # Rules dict for phpdoc ruleset.
    rulesDict8 = {
        "*": [rule64,],
        "0": [rule70,],
        "1": [rule70,],
        "2": [rule70,],
        "3": [rule70,],
        "4": [rule70,],
        "5": [rule70,],
        "6": [rule70,],
        "7": [rule70,],
        "8": [rule70,],
        "9": [rule70,],
        "&lt;": [rule65,rule66,rule67,rule68,rule69,],
        "@": [rule70,],
        "A": [rule70,],
        "B": [rule70,],
        ...
        "X": [rule70,],
        "Y": [rule70,],
        "Z": [rule70,],
        "_": [rule70,],
        "a": [rule70,],
        "b": [rule70,],
       ...
        "x": [rule70,],
        "y": [rule70,],
        "z": [rule70,],
        "{": [rule63,],
    }

**Note**: The order of rules in each rules list is important; it should be the same as rules element in x.xml.

Finally, x.py contains **x.rulesDictDict**. Keys are ruleset names, values are rules dictionaries. The colorer can get the rules list for character ch as follows::

    self.rulesDict = x.rulesDictDict.get(rulesetName) # When a mode is inited.
    ...
    rules = self.rulesDict.get(ch,[]) # In the main loop.

For example, here is the rules dictionary for php.py::

    # x.rulesDictDict for php mode.
    rulesDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": rulesDict6,
        "php_javascript_php": rulesDict7,
        "php_main": rulesDict1,
        "php_php": rulesDict4,
        "php_php_literal": rulesDict5,
        "php_phpdoc": rulesDict8,
        "php_tags": rulesDict2,
        "php_tags_literal": rulesDict3,
    }

**Note**: The jEdit2Py script creates 'friendly' names for rules lists *solely* as an aid for people reading the code. Leo's colorer uses only the name x.rulesDictDict; Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of rules lists such as rulesDict8, and Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of rules functions such as rule64.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502100550">A **ruleset name** is a Python string having the form 'x_setname', where setname is the value of the SET attribute of the &lt;RULES&gt; element in x.xml. For example, the ruleset name of the ruleset whose SET attribute is JAVASCRIPT in php.xml is 'php_JAVASCRIPT'. **Important**: by convention, the ruleset name of the default &lt;RULES&gt; element is 'x_main'; note that default &lt;RULES&gt; element have no SET attributes.

The colorizer uses ruleset names to gain access to all data structures in x.py. To anticipate a bit, ruleset names are keys into two standard dictionaries, x.rulesDict and x.keywordsDictDict, from which the colorizer can get all other information in x.py::

    # The rules list for the 'JAVASCRIPT' ruleset in php.xml.
    rules = x.rulesDict('php_JAVASCRIPT')

    # The keywords dict for the 'JAVASCRIPT' ruleset in php.xml.
    keywordsDict = x.keywordsDictDict('php_JAVASCRIPT')

In fact, ruleset names (and x.rulesDict and x.keywordsDictDict) are the **only** names that the colorizer needs to know in order to access all information in x.py.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502122950">This section describes each rules method in Leo's new colorizer. Rules methods are called by rules functions in colorizer control file; they correspond directly to rules elements in jEdit's language description files. In fact, this documentation is a 'refactoring' of `jEdit's documentation`_.

All rule methods attempt to match a pattern at a particular spot in a string. These methods all return True if the match succeeds.

match_mark_previous succeeds if s[i:].startswith(pattern),and the at_line_start, at_whitespace_end and at_word_start conditions are all satisfied.

If successful, match_mark_previous colors from the end of the previous token to i with the color specified by kind. If the exclude_match argument is True, only the text before the matched text will be colored.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060503064515">All rule methods take three required arguments and zero or more optional keyword arguments.

Here is a list of the required arguments and their meaning:

- **self**: An instance of Leo's colorizer.

- **s**: The string in which matches may be found.

- **i**: The location within the string at which the rule method looks for a match.

Here is a list of all optional keyword arguments and their meaning:

- **at_line_start**:
  If True, a match will succeed only if i is at the start of a line.

- **at_whitespace_end**:
  If True, the match will succeed only if i is at the first non-whitespace text in a line.

- **at_word_start**:
  If True, the match will succeed only if i is at the beginning of a word.

- **delegate**:
  If non-empty, the value of this argument is a `ruleset name`_.
  If the match succeeds, the matched text will be colored recursively with the indicate ruleset.

- **exclude_match**:
  If True, the actual text that matched will not be colored.
  The meaning of this argument varies slightly depending on whether one or two sequences are matched.
  See the individual rule methods for details.

- **kind**: A string representing a class of tokens, i.e., one of:
  'comment1', 'comment2', 'comment3', 'comment4', 'function',
  'keyword1', 'keyword2', 'keyword3', 'keyword4',
  'label', 'literal1', 'literal2', 'literal3', 'literal4',
  'markup', 'null' and 'operator'.

- **no_escape**:
  If True, the ruleset's escape character will have no effect before the end argument to match_span.
  Otherwise, the presence of the escape character will cause that occurrence of the end string to be ignored.

- **no_line_break**:
  If True, the match will not succeed across line breaks.

- **no_word_break**:
  If True, the match will not cross word breaks.

New in Leo 4.4.1 final: the regular expression rule matchers no longer get a hash_char argument
because such matchers are called only if the present search pattern starts with hash_char.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060503072213">x.importDict is a Python dictionary. Keys are ruleset names; values are a list of ruleset names. For example::

    # Import dict for php mode.
    importDict = {
        "php_javascript_php": ["javascript::main"],
    }

For any ruleset R whose ruleset name is N, x.importDict.get(N) is the list of rulesets names whose rulesets appear in a DELEGATE attribute of an &lt;IMPORT&gt; rule element in R's ruleset. Such **imported** ruleset are copied to the end of the R's rules list. Leo's colorizer does this copying only once, when loading ruleset R for the first time.

**Note 1**: Loading imported rulesets must be done at 'run time'. It should definitely not be done by jEdit2Py at 'compile time'; that would require running jEdit2Py on *all* .xml files whenever any such file changed.

**Note 2**:  Multiple &lt;IMPORT&gt; rule elements in a single ruleset are allowed: delegated rules are copied to the end of N's rules list in the order they appear in the ruleset.

**Note 3**: The DELEGATE attribute of &lt;IMPORT&gt; elements is, in fact, completely separate from the DELEGATE attributes of other rules as discussed in `Arguments to rule methods`_. Indeed, the DELEGATE attribute of &lt;IMPORT&gt; elements creates entries in x.importDict, which in turn causes the colorizer to append the rules of the imported ruleset to the end of the present rules list. In contrast, the DELEGATE attributes of other rules sets the delegate argument to rules methods, which in tern causes the colorizer to recursively color the matched text with the **delegated** ruleset. In short:

- The rules of **imported** rulesets are appended to the end of another rules list; the rules of **delegated** rulesets never are.

- **Imported** ruleset names appear as the values of items in x.importDict; **delegated** ruleset names appear as delegate arguments to rule methods.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060510085547">x.py contains a **attribute dictionary** for each ruleset in x.xml. Keys are attribute names, values strings representing the values of the attributes. This dictionary is empty if a ruleset contains no attributes. The valid keys are:

- 'default': the default token type.  'null' is the default.

- 'digit_re': a regular expression.
  Words matching this regular expression are colored with the digit token type.

- 'ignore_case': 'true' or 'false'.  Default is 'true'.

- 'highlight_digits': 'true' or 'false'.  Default is 'true'.

- 'no_word_sep': A list of characters treated as 'alphabetic' characters when matching keywords.

For example, here is one attribute dictionary in php.py::

    # Attributes dict for php_javascript ruleset.
    php_javascript_attributes_dict = {
        "default": "MARKUP",
        "digit_re": "",
        "highlight_digits": "true",
        "ignore_case": "true",
        "no_word_sep": "",
    }

x.py also contains **x.attributesDictDict**. Keys are ruleset names, values are attribute dictionaries. Here is attributesDictDict for php.py::

    # Dictionary of attributes dictionaries for php mode.
    attributesDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": php_javascript_attributes_dict,
        "php_javascript_php": php_javascript_php_attributes_dict,
        "php_main": php_main_attributes_dict,
        "php_php": php_php_attributes_dict,
        "php_php_literal": php_php_literal_attributes_dict,
        "php_phpdoc": php_phpdoc_attributes_dict,
        "php_tags": php_tags_attributes_dict,
        "php_tags_literal": php_tags_literal_attributes_dict,
    }

**Note**: The jEdit2Py script creates 'friendly' names for attribute dictionaries *solely* as an aid for people reading the code. Leo's colorer uses only the name x.attributeDictDict; Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of attribute dictionaries.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060527103630">A new method has been added to make it more easily to write rST code from scripts::

    c.rstCommands.writeNodeToString(p)

``writeNodeToString`` scans p's tree (p defaults to presently selected node) looking for @rst nodes. When the first @rst node is found, writeNodeToString processes the node as usual, with the following changes:

- @rst need not be followed by a filename; any filename and its extension are *ignored*.

- Only the ext argument to writeNodeToString determines the type of output produced. The valid values for the ext argument are None (for rst output), '.html', '.pdf', and '.tex'.

- Instead of writing the result to a file, writeNodeToString returns the tuple (p,s), where p is the node whose tree produced the output, and s is the output itself.

- writeNodeToString returns after processing at most one @rst node.

Scripts can easily use writeNodeToString to convert @rst trees into various kinds of output. For example::

    p,s = c.rstCommands.writeNodeToString(p,ext='html')

Notes:

- This script scans the presently selected tree for @rst nodes. In particular, if the presently selected tree does not contain an @rst node the search continues in parent trees. When an @rst node is found, it converts the node (and descendants) to html and returns p, the found @rst node and s, the html itself.

- Valid values for the ext argument are ".html", ".tex" or None (specifies rst output)

- There is some support for ext=".pdf", but this is experimental code.  Expect crashes.

<t tx="ekr.20060527112801">The following settings in leoSettings.leo control debugger operation. The settings shown here will be assumed to be in effect throughout this chapter::

    @string debugger_kind = winpdb

This setting controls what debugger the 'Debug Script' script button uses. Eventually this setting will control what debugger the debug command uses:: At present the only valid value is 'winpdb'

    @bool write_script_file = True

True: The execute script command writes the script to be executed to a file, then executes the script using Python's execFile function. The script_file_path setting specifies the path to this file. False (legacy): The execute script command uses Python's exec command to execute the script.

@string script_file_path = ../test/scriptFile.py

The path to the file to be written by the execute-script command. Notes:

- This setting has effect only if the write_script_file setting is True.
- Use / as the path delimiter, regardless of platform.
- The default path is ../test/scriptFile.py if no path is given.
- The path starts at g.app.loadDir, so for example ../test/scriptFile.py is equivalent to leo/test/scriptFile.py.
- The filename should end in .py.

@string debugger_path = None

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060529053407">@ignore can only be used in the root node of @file trees.  It tells Leo to ignore the tree.

The @ignore directive can not be used elsewhere in @file trees because of the way Leo recreates outlines from external files. This is an absolutely crucial restriction and will never go away. For a few more details, see `Leo 4.0: Eliminating error 'recovery'`_ in `History of Leo`_.

There are several workaround, as shown in LeoPy.leo:

- keep notes in the outline outside of any external file.

- Use @all to gather notes in a external file, as in done in @file leoProjects.txt.

Writing Plugins
###############

Plugins modify how Leo works. With plugins you can give Leo new commands,
modify how existing commands work, or change any other aspect of Leo's look
and feel.

leoPlugins.leo contains all of Leo's official plugins. Studying this file is
a good way to learn how to write plugins.

Writing plugins is like writing any other Leo script.  See
`Scripting Leo with Python`_. In particular:

1. Plugins can use any of Leo's source code simply by importing any module
   defined in leoPy.leo.

2. Plugins can register event handlers just like any other Leo script. For full
   details, see the section called `Handling Events`_ later in this chapter.

The rest of this chapters discusses topics related specifically to plugins.

Leo 4.4 also featured many improvements in how keys are bound to commands, including per-pane bindings and user-defined key-binding modes. These features allow users to emulate Emacs, Vim, or any other editor. They also make it easy to use Leo without a mouse.

This release created many Emacs-like commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring, regions and rectangles. Much of the work started with a prototype by LeoUser (B.H).

    The **Newer World Order**: c.endUpdate is equivalent to c.redraw_now

Development on long-delayed projects accelerated after 4.4 final went out the door::

    Syntax coloring controlled using jEdit's xml language-description files
    Support for debugging scripts using external debuggers
    Leo's vnodes and tnodes can support ZODB
    Using pymacs to write Leo scripts within Emacs
    Added the leoBridge module
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060805094325">You can 'revert' to old key bindings as follows:

1. Open leoSettings.leo.

2. Find the node 'Keyboard shortcuts'.

3. Disable the old bindings by moving the node '@keys EKR bindings: Emacs keys + modes' so that it is a child of the node: '@ignore Unused key bindings'.

4. Notice that there are two child nodes of the node '@ignore Unused key bindings' that refer to legacy key bindings:

   - '@keys Legacy Leo shortcuts with important Emacs bindings'

   - '@keys Legacy Leo bindings'.

5. Move **one** of these two legacy nodes up one level so that it is a child of the node 'Keyboard shortcuts'. It should **not** be a child of the node '@ignore Unused key bindings'.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060822140418">Leo 4.4.1 final was released August 30, 2006.

::

    Added new colorizer plugin controlled by jEdit language description files
    Added the shadow files plugin, a precursor to @shadow
    Added support for multiple editors in the body pane
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060830142929">This section discusses only those settings that affect syntax coloring. See `Customizing Leo`_ for a general discussion of Leo's settings.

Both the old colorizer (in Leo's core) and the new colorizer (the threading_colorizer and qtGui plugins) now support @color and @font settings for colorizing options. The settings for the old colorizer are::

    comment_font, cweb_section_name_font, directive_font,
    doc_part_font, keyword_font, leo_keyword_font, section_name_font,
    section_name_brackets_font, string_font, undefined_section_name_font,
    latexBackground_font, and latex_background_font.

The settings for the new colorizer are all of the above (except keyword_font) plus the following::

    comment1_font, comment2_font, comment3_font, comment4_font, function_font,
    keyword1_font, keyword2_font, keyword3_font, keyword4_font, label_font,
    literal1_font, literal2_font, literal3_font, literal4_font, markup_font,
    null_font, and operator_font.
    
To specify a color, say for comment1, for *all* languages, create an @color node::

    @color comment1_color = blue
    
To specify a color for a **particular** language, say Python, prepend the setting name
with the language name.  For example::

    @color python_comment1_color = pink

To specify a font, say for keyword_font, to be used as the default font for **all** languages, put the following in the body text of an @font node in leoSettings.leo::

    # keyword_font_family = None
    keyword_font_size = 16
    keyword_font_slant = roman
        # roman, italic
    keyword_font_weight = bold
        # normal, bold

Comments are allowed and undefined settings are set to reasonable defaults. At present, comments can not follow a setting: comments must start a line.

You can specify per-language settings by preceding the settings names by a prefix x. Such settings affect only colorizing for language x (i.e., all the modes in modes/x.py when using the new colorizer). For example, to specify a font for php (only), put the following in the body text of an @font node in leoSettings.leo::

    # php_keyword_font_family = None
    php_keyword_font_size = 16
    php_keyword_font_slant = roman
        # roman, italic
    php_keyword_font_weight = bold
        # normal, bold

Using ZODB with Leo

<t tx="ekr.20060913165542.2">This function inits the zodb. pathToZodbStorage is the full path to the zodb storage file. You can call g.init_zodb as many times as you like. Only the first call for any path actually does anything: subsequent calls for a previously opened path simply return the same value as the first call.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913165542.3">This vnode method returns v2, a copy of v that is completely detached from the outline. v2.fileIndex is unrelated to v.fileIndex initially, but it may be convenient to copy this field::

    v2 = v.detach()
    v2.fileIndex = v.fileIndex
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170145">To enable zodb scripting within Leo, you must set use_zodb = True in the root node of leoNodes.py. You must also install ZODB itself.  See `Installing ZODB`_ for details.

When ZODB is installed and use_zodb is True, Leo's vnode class becomes a subclass of ZODB.Persistence.Persistent. This is all that is needed to save/retrieve vnodes or tnodes to/from the ZODB.

**Important notes**:

- Scripts **should not** store or retrieve positions using the ZODB! Doing so makes sense neither from Leo's point of view nor from ZODB's point of view.

- The examples below show how to store or retrieve Leo data by accessing the so-called root of a ZODB connection. However, these are only examples. Scripts are free to do with Leo's vnodes *anything* that can be done with ZODB.Persistence.Persistent objects.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403">Scripts should call g.init_zodb to open a ZODB.Storage file. g.init_zodb returns an instance of ZODB.DB.  For example::

    db = g.init_zodb (zodbStorageFileName)

You can call g.init_zodb as many times as you like. Only the first call for any path actually does anything: subsequent calls for a previously opened path simply return the same value as the first call.

        root = connection.root()
        root[aKey] = v # See next section for how to define aKey.
    finally:
        get_transaction().commit()
        connection.close()

Notes:

- v must be a vnode.
  Scripts should *not* attempt to store Leo positions in the zodb.
  v can be the root of an entire outline or a subtree.
  For example, either of the following would be reasonable::

    root[aKey] = c.rootPosition().v
    root[aKey] = c.p.v

- To write a single vnode without writing any of its children you can use v.detach.
  For example::

    root[aKey] = v.detach()

- **Important**: It is simplest if only one zodb connection is open at any one time,
  so scripts would typically close the zodb connection immediately after processing the data.
  The correct way to do this is in a finally statement, as shown above.

- The script above does not define aKey.
  The following section discusses how to define reasonable zodb keys.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403.2">The following script reads a tree of vnodes from zodb and sets p as the root position of the tree::

    try:
        connection = db.open()
        root = connection.root()
        v = root.get(aKey)
        p = leoNodes.position(v)
    finally:
        get_transaction().commit()
        connection.close()
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913175437">The keys used to store and retrieve data in connection.root() can be any string that uniquely identifies the data. The following are only suggestions; you are free to use any string you like.

1. When saving a file, you would probably use a key that is similar to a real file path.
   For example::

        aKey = c.fileName()

2. When saving a single vnode or tree of vnodes, say v,
   a good choice would be to use v's gnx, namely::

        aKey = g.app.nodeIndices.toString(v.fileIndex)

   Note that v.detach() does not automatically copy v.fileIndex to the detached node,
   so when writing a detached node you would typically do the following::

       v2 = v.detach()
       v2.fileIndex = v.fileIndex
       aKey = g.app.nodeIndices.toString(v2.fileIndex)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913175437.1">The scripts shown above close the zodb connection after processing the data. This is by far the simplest strategy. I recommend it for typical scripts.

**Important**: you must **leave the connection open** if your script modifies persistent data in any way. (Actually, this statement is not really true, but you must define zodb transaction managers if you intend to use multiple connections simultaneously. This complication is beyond the scope of this documentation.) For example, it would be possible to create a new Leo outline from the data just read, but the script must leave the connection open. I do not recommend this tactic, but for the adventurous here is some sample code::

    connection = self.db.open()
    root = connection.root()
    v = root.get(fileName)
    if v:
        c2 = c.new()
        c2.openDirectory = c.openDirectory # A hack.
        c2.mFileName = fileName # Another hack.
        c2.beginUpdate()
        try:
            c2.setRootVnode(v)
            c2Root = c2.rootPosition()
            c2.atFileCommands.readAll(c2Root)
            g.es_print('zodb read: %s' % (fileName))
        finally:
            c2.endUpdate()
        # Do *not* close the connection while the new Leo window is open!
    else:
        g.es_print('zodb read: not found: %s' % (fileName))


This will work **provided** that no other zodb connection is ever opened while this connection is opened. Unless special zodb precautions are taken (like defining zodb transaction managers) calling get_transaction().commit() will affect **all** open connections. You have been warned.

<t tx="ekr.20060915112109">Find the @file leoApp.py node in leoPy.leo. In the ctor for the LeoApp class set self.use_psyco to True or False. You will find this ctor in the node::

    Code--&gt;Core classes...--&gt;@file leoApp.py--&gt;app.__init__

Note that this ivar can not be set using settings in leoSettings.leo because Leo uses g.app.use_psyco before processing configuration settings.

<t tx="ekr.20060917130130">Add the following to the start of your scripts::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Without this line, constructs such as::

    u = u'a-(2 unicode characters here)-z'
    u = 'a-(2 unicode characters here)-z'

will not work when executed with Leo's execute script command. Indeed, the Execute Script command creates the script by writing the tree containing the script to a string. This is done using Leo's write logic, and this logic converts the unicode input to a utf-8 encoded string. So *all non-ascii characters* get converted to their equivalent in the utf-8 encoding. Call these encoding &lt;e1&gt; and &lt;e2&gt;. In effect the script becomes::

    u = u'a-&lt;e1&gt;-&lt;e2&gt;-z'
    u = 'a-&lt;e2&gt;-&lt;e&gt;-z'

which is certainly *not* what the script writer intended! Rather than defining strings using actual characters, Instead, one should use the equivalent escape sequences. For example::

    u = u'a-\\u0233-\\u8ce2-z'
    u = 'a-\\u0233-\\u8ce2-z'
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060921064744.1">This section describe the format of external files. Leo's `sentinel lines`_ are comments, and this section describes those comments.

.. index:: gnx

External files created by @file use gnx's in @+node sentinels. Such gnx's permanently and uniquely identify nodes. Gnx's have the form::

    id.yyyymmddhhmmss
    id.yyyymmddhhmmss.n

The second form is used if two gnx's would otherwise be identical.

- id is a string unique to a developer, e.g., a git id.

- yyyymmddhhmmss is the node's creation date.

- n is an integer.

Closing sentinels are required for section references and the @all and @others directives, collectively known as **embedding constructs.** Proof: These constructs do not terminate the node in which they appear. Without a closing sentinel there would be no way to know where the construct ended and the following lines of the enclosing node began.

New sentinels do not include @nonl or @nl. As a result, body text always ends with at least one newline.

Here are the sentinels used by Leo, in alphabetical order. Unless otherwise noted, the documentation applies to all versions of Leo. In the following discussion, gnx denotes a gnx as described above.

\@&lt;&lt;
    A sentinel of the form @&lt;&lt;section_name&gt;&gt; represents a section reference.

    If the reference does not end the line, the sentinel line ending
    the expansion is followed by the remainder of the reference line.
    This allows the Read code to recreate the reference line exactly.

\@@
    The @@ sentinel represents any line starting with @ in body text
    except @*whitespace*, @doc and @others.
    Examples::

      @@nocolor
      @@pagewidth 80
      @@tabwidth 4
      @@code

\@afterref
    Marks non-whitespace text appearing after a section references.

\@+all
    Marks the start of text generated by the @all directive.

\@-all
    Marks the end of text generated by the @all directive.

\@at and @doc

    The @+doc @+at sentinels indicate the start of a doc parts.

    We use the following **trailing whitespace convention** to
    determine where putDocPart has inserted line breaks::

        A line in a doc part is followed by an inserted newline
        if and only if the newline if preceded by whitespace.

    To make this convention work, Leo's write code deletes the trailing
    whitespace of all lines that are followed by a "real" newline.

\@+body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the start of body text.

\@-body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the end of body text.

\@delims
    The @delims directive inserts @@delims sentinels into the
    external file. The new delimiter strings continue in effect until
    the next @@delims sentinel *in the external file* or until the
    end of the external file. Adding, deleting or changing @@delim
    *sentinels* will destroy Leo's ability to read the external file.
    Mistakes in using the @delims *directives* have no effect on Leo,
    though such mistakes will thoroughly mess up a external file as
    far as compilers, HTML renderers, etc. are concerned.

\@+leo
    Marks the start of any external file. This sentinel has the form::

        &lt;opening_delim&gt;@leo&lt;closing_delim&gt;

    The read code uses single-line comments if &lt;closing_delim&gt; is empty.
    The write code generates single-line comments if possible.

    The @+leo sentinel contains other information. For example::

        &lt;opening_delim&gt;@leo-ver=4-thin&lt;closing_delim&gt;

\@-leo
    Marks the end of the Leo file.
    Nothing but whitespace should follow this directive.

\@+middle **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the start of intermediate nodes between the node that
    references a section and the node that defines the section.
    Typically no such sentinels are needed:
    most sections are defined in a direct child of the referencing node.

\@-middle **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the end of intermediate nodes between the node that
    references a section and the node that defines the section.
    
\@nl **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Insert a newline in the outline.

\@+node
    Mark the start and end of a node::

        @+node:gnx:&lt;headline&gt;
        
\@nonl **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Suppresses a newline in the outline.

\@others
    The @+others sentinel indicates the start of the expansion of an @+others          
    directive, which continues until the matching @-others sentinel.

\@verbatim
    @verbatim indicates that the next line of the external file is not a sentinel.
    This escape convention allows body text to contain lines that would otherwise
    be considered sentinel lines.

\@@verbatimAfterRef
    @verbatimAfterRef is generated when a comment following a section reference would
    otherwise be treated as a sentinel. In Python code, an example would be::

      &lt;&lt; ref &gt;&gt; #+others

<t tx="ekr.20061025070825.1">The leoPymacs module is intended to be called from Emacs using pymacs.  It contains the following top-level functions:

- get_app()

  Returns the hidden app created by the leoPymacs.init function.

- dump(anyPythonObject)

  Returns str(repr(anyPythonObject)).

- get_g()

  Returns the leoGlobals module of the hidden app created by the leoPymacs.init function.

- get_script_result()

  Returns g.app.scriptResult, where g.app is the hidden app.

- init()
  Calls leo.run(pymacs=True) to create a hidden Leo application.
  Later calls to open can open hidden Leo outlines that can be accessed via runScript.

- open(fileName)

  Opens the .leo file given by fileName. fileName must be the full
  path to a .leo file. Returns the commander of the open Leo outline,
  or None if the outline could not be opened.

- run_script(c,script,p=None)

  Executes a script in the context of a commander c returned by the leoPymacs.open.
  c may be None, in which case a dummy commander is created in which to run the script.
  In the executed script, p is set to c.p if no p argument is specified.
  Returns g.app.scriptResult, where g.app is the hidden app.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061025081359">Leo's leoPymacs module is a simple 'server' for the pymacs_ package. Using pymacs and leoPymacs, elisp_ scripts in Emacs_ can open .leo files and execute *Python* scripts as if they were executed inside Leo. In particular, such scripts can use Leo's predefined c, g and p variables. Thus, *Python* scripts running in Emacs can:

- Open any .leo file. 
- Access any part of the outline. 
- Change any part of the outline, including external files, 
- Save .leo files.
- Execute *any* Leo script.

In short, you can now do from Emacs anything that you can do with Leo scripting inside Leo.

Here are step-by-step instructions for executing Python scripts in Emacs:

**Step 1. Install pymacs** 

   The pymacs installation instructions should be clear enough.
   A clarification is needed about two-way communication between Python and lisp scripts:
   in truth, Python scripts can call the Pymacs.lisp function *only* if the Python script
   was invoked from emacs.
   Otherwise, calling Pymacs.lisp will hang the process making the call.
   For example, executing the following script as an ordinary Leo script will hang Leo::

        from Pymacs import lisp
        print lisp("""2+2""") # Hangs

**Step 2. Load the leoPymacs module from Emacs, creating a hidden Leo application**

  From inside Emacs, you load Leo's leoPymacs module as follows::

    (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-")

  The call to pymacs-load is similar to 'import leoPymacs as leo-' in
  Python. The side effect of pymacs-load is to define the elisp
  function leo-x for every top-level function x in leoPymacs.py,
  namely leo-dump, leo-get-app, leo-get-g, leo-get-script-result,
  leo-init, leo-open and leo-run-script. The first call to any of
  these functions creates a **hidden Leo application** in which .leo
  files may be loaded, modified and saved, and in which Leo scripts
  may be executed. This hidden Leo application uses Leo's nullGui
  class as its gui, so Leo commands and Leo scripts that require a
  fully functional gui will not work as expected in the hidden Leo
  application. Steps 3 and 4 tell how to use this hidden Leo
  application.

  pymacs-load works like a Python reload, so you can redefine
  leoPymacs.py while Emacs is running. However, calling pymacs-load
  destroys the old hidden Leo application and creates a new one, so
  typically you would want to call pymacs-load only once per Emacs
  session. Like this::

        (setq reload nil) ; change nil to t to force a reload.

        (if (or reload (not (boundp 'leoPymacs)))
            (setq leoPymacs (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-"))
            (message "leoPymacs already loaded")
        )

**Step 3. From Emacs, open .leo files**

   Once we have loaded the leoPymacs module
   we can open a .leo file as follows::

    (setq c (leo-open fileName))

   This binds the elisp c variable to the Leo commander created by opening fileName.
   fileName should be the full path to a .leo file.
   In the next step we will use this c variable to execute *Leo* scripts in the
   context of an open Leo outline.

   Sometimes we want to execute a Leo script before opening any Leo commanders.
   For example, we might want to compute the fileName passed to leo-open.
   leo-run-script allows the c argument to be nil,
   in which case leo-run-script creates a dummy commander in which to run the script.
   For example, the following script calls g.os_path_join and g.os_path_abspath::

        (setq script "g.app.scriptResult =
            g.os_path_abspath(g.os_path_join(
                g.app.loadDir,'..','test','ut.leo'))"
        )

        (setq fileName (leo-run-script nil script))

   leo-run-script returns the value of g.app.scriptResult
   As shown above, Python scripts may set g.app.scriptResult to indicate their result.
   elisp scripts can also get g.app.scriptResult using leo-script-result.
   Note that the Python script may span multiple lines.

**Step 4. From Emacs, execute Leo (Python) scripts**

   From emacs we can execute a Python script **as if** it were executed in an
   open Leo outline.
   Suppose aLeoScript is an **elisp** string containing a Leo (Python) script.
   We can execute that script in the hidden Leo application as follows::

        (leo-run-script c aLeoScript)

   For example::

        (setq c (leo-open fileName)
        (csetq script "print 'c',c,'h',c.p.h")
        (leo-run-script c script)

Putting this all together, we get::

        ; Step 1: load leoPymacs if it has not already been loaded.
        (setq reload nil)
        (if (or reload (not (boundp 'leoPymacs)))
            (setq leoPymacs (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-"))
            (message "leoPymacs already loaded")
        )

        ; Step 2: compute the path to leo/test/ut.leo using a Leo script.
        (setq script
            "g.app.scriptResult = g.os_path_abspath(
                g.os_path_join(g.app.loadDir,'..','test','ut.leo'))"
        )
        (setq fileName (leo-run-script nil script))

        ; Step 3: execute a script in ut.leo.
        (setq c (leo-open fileName))
        (setq script "print 'c',c.shortFileName() ,'current:',c.p.h")
        (leo-run-script c script)

<t tx="ekr.20061025142434">Leo's mini-buffer is a text area at the bottom of the body pane. You use Leo's minibuffer like the Emacs mini-buffer to invoke commands by their so-called *long name*. The following commands affect the minibuffer:

- **full-command**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Puts the focus in the minibuffer. Type a full command name, then hit &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command. Tab completion works, but not yet for file names.

- **quick-command-mode**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Like Emacs Control-C. This mode is defined in leoSettings.leo. It is useful for commonly-used commands.

- **universal-argument**: (default shortcut: Alt-u) Like Emacs Ctrl-u. Adds a repeat count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's.

- **keyboard-quit**: (default shortcut: Ctrl-g) Exits any minibuffer mode and puts the focus in the body pane.

For example, to print a list of all commands type Alt-X print-commands &lt;Return&gt;.

<t tx="ekr.20070115172724">The following three section discuss three ways of debugging scripts with winpdb_. The first two sections tell how to debug general scripts; the last section tells how to debug Leo-specific scripts.

winpdb_ and its documentation have been improved recently. For more details, see the `embedded winpdb`_ docs. The discussion of embedded debugging may have been written specifically with Leo in mind.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.1">This way of debugging can only be used for general scripts, not leo-specific scripts. The debug command writes the script to scriptFile.py and invokes winpdb. winpdb opens and is already 'attached' to the script to be debugged. You can single-step as you like. Leo continues to run, but killing the debugger will also kill Leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.3">This way of debugging scripts allows winpdb to debug scripts that use c, g and p. A bit more work is needed because winpdb does not start automatically. Here are step-by step instructions:

1. Insert the following two lines of code at the start of the script to be debugged::

    import rpdb2
    rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger('go',fAllowUnencrypted=True)

2. Execute Leo's execute-script command (*not* the debug command). Leo will appear to hang: start_embedded_debugger is waiting for *another* copy of winpdb to 'attach' to the script's process. The default timeout is 5 minutes, after which an exception gets thrown.

3. Start winpdb explicitly by executing something like the following in a console::

    python /Python26/Scripts/_winpdb.py -t

   The -t option tells winpdb that no encoding of password is necessary.
   The password is specified in the call to rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger in your script.
   In our example, the password is 'go'.

4. Use winpdb's File:Attach command to attach winpdb to Leo. Specify the password as 'go' and you will see the scriptFile.py containing your entire script. You can now execute or single-step through the script. To repeat, c, g and p are defined, so you can debug any script this way.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070116062405">Inserting g.trace statements in my Python code is usually my first debugging choice. The g.trace statement prints the name of the function in which the call to g.trace occurs, followed by the value of its arguments. The output of the g.trace goes to the console, so you must `run Leo in a console window`_ to use g.trace.

Inserting and deleting g.trace statements is fast, provided that your `work flow`_ makes it easy to restart the program under test. As a result, using g.trace statements is similar to setting tracepoints in a debugger, with the advantage that (disabled) tracepoints remain in the source code for future use. You will find many examples of using g.trace throughout Leo's source code.

My second choice is using g.pdb to set breakpoints for the pdb_ debugger. Pdb uses the console for all interaction, so you must `run Leo in a console window`_. See `the FAQ`_ for a discussion of both g.trace and g.pdb.

    pair: Predefined Symbols; Tutorial
    
The execute-script command predefines the symbols c, g and p.

c is the **commander** of the outline containing the script.

- Commanders are instances of the Commands class, defined in leoCommands.py.

- Commanders provide access to all outline data *and* all of Leo's source code.

g is Leo's **leo.core.leoGlobals** module.

- This module contains many useful functions, including g.es.

p is the **position** of the presently selected node.

- positions are instances of the position class, defined in leoNodes.py.

- The position class provides safe, convenient ways of accessing and
  modifying outline nodes.

- For any position p, p.v is a **vnode** object.

Embedding Leo with the leoBridge module
#######################################

The leoBridge module allows complete access to all aspects of Leo from other
Python programs running independently of Leo. Let us call such a program a
**host** program. Using the leoBridge module, host programs can get access to:

- all of Leo's source code,
- the contents of any .leo file,
- the commander of any .leo file.

.. contents::
    :depth: 2

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070317033759.2">.. Links
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070317033759.3">Host programs use the leoBridge module as follows::

    import leo.core.leoBridge as leoBridge
    
    controller = leoBridge.controller(gui='nullGui',
        loadPlugins=True,  # True: attempt to load plugins.
        readSettings=True, # True: read standard settings files.
        silent=False,      # True: don't print signon messages.
        verbose=False)     # True: print informational messages.

    g = controller.globals()
    c = controller.openLeoFile(path)

Let us look at these statements in detail. The first two statements import the leoBridge module and create a **bridge controller**. In effect, these statements embed an invisible copy of Leo into the host program. This embedded copy of Leo uses a null gui, which simulates all aspects of Leo's normal gui code without creating any screen objects.

The statement::

    g = controller.globals()

provides access to Leo's leoGlobals module, and properly inits globals such as g.app, g.app.gui, etc. *Host programs should not import leoGlobals directly*, because doing so would not init the g.app object properly.

The statement::

    c = controller.openLeoFile(path)

invisibly opens the .leo file given by the path argument. This call returns a completely standard Leo commander, properly inited. This is the big payoff from the leoBridge module: the host program gets instant access to c.config.getBool, etc. Do you see how sweet this is?

For example, the following script runs leo/test/leoBridgeTest.py outside of Leo. leoBridgeTest.py uses the leoBridge module to run all unit tests in leo/test/unitTest.leo::

    import os,sys

    path = g.os_path_abspath(
        g.os_path_join(
            g.app.loadDir,'..','test','leoBridgeTest.py'))

    os.system('%s %s' % (sys.executable,path))

The file leo/test/test.leo contains the source code for leoBridgeTest.py. Here it is, stripped of its sentinel lines::

Unit testing with Leo
#####################

This chapter describes how you can execute Python unit test from within Leo
outlines.

Leo's **unit test commands** run the unit tests created by @test and @suite
nodes. run-unit-tests and run-unit-tests-locally run all unit tests in the
presently selected part of the Leo outline; run-all-unit-tests and
run-all-unit-tests-locally run all unit tests in the entire Leo outline.

Important: you must `run Leo in a console window`_ to see the output the
unit tests. Leo's unit test commands run all the unit tests using the
standard unittest text test runner, and the output of the unit tests
appears in the console.

test/unitTest.leo contains many examples of using @test and @suite nodes.

.. _`run Leo in a console window`:      installing.html#running-leo-from-a-console-window
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628084351">**@test nodes** are nodes whose headlines start with @test. The unit test commands convert the body text of @test nodes into a unit test automatically. That is, Leo's unit test commands automatically create a unittest.TestCase instances which run the body text of the @test node. For example, let us consider one of Leo's actual unit tests. The headline is::

    @test consistency of back/next links

The body text is::

    if g.unitTesting:
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional: prevents pychecker warnings.
        for p in c.all_positions():
            back = p.back()
            next = p.next()
            if back: assert(back.getNext() == p)
            if next: assert(next.getBack() == p)

When either of Leo's unit test commands finds this @test node the command will
run a unit test equivalent to the following::

    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

    class aTestCase (unittest.TestCase):
        def shortDescription():
            return '@test consistency of back/next links'
        def runTest():
            c,p = g.getTestVars()
            for p in c.all_positions():
                back = p.back()
                next = p.next()
                if back: assert(back.getNext() == p)
                if next: assert(next.getBack() == p)

As you can see, using @test nodes saves a lot of typing:

- You don't have to define a subclass of unittest.TestCase.
- Within your unit test, the c, g and p variables are predefined, just like in Leo scripts.
- The entire headline of the @test node becomes the short description of the unit test.

**Important note**: notice that the first line of the body text is a **guard line**::

    if g.unitTesting:

This guard line is needed because this particular @test node is contained in the file leoNodes.py. @test nodes that appear outside of Python source files do not need guard lines. The guard line prevents the unit testing code from being executed when Python imports the leoNodes module; the g.unitTesting variable is True only while running unit tests.

**New in Leo 4.6**: When Leo runs unit tests, Leo predefines the 'self' variable to be the instance of the test itself, that is an instance of unittest.TestCase. This allows you to use methods such as self.assertTrue in @test and @suite nodes.

**Note**: Leo predefines the c, g, and p variables in @test and @suite nodes, just like in other scripts.  Thus, the line::

    c,p = g.getTestVars()

is not needed. However, it prevents pychecker warnings that c and p are undefined.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628094515.1">**@suite nodes** are nodes whose headlines start with @suite. @suite nodes allow you to create and run custom subclasses of unittest.TestCase.

Leo's test commands assume that the body of an suite node is a script that creates a suite of tests and places that suite in g.app.scriptDict['suite']. Something like this::

    if g.unitTesting:
        __pychecker__ = '--no-reimport' # Prevents pychecker complaint.
        import unittest
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional.
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        &lt;&lt; add one or more tests (instances of unittest.TestCase) to suite &gt;&gt;
        g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite

**Note**: as in @test nodes, the guard line, 'if unitTesting:', is needed only if the
@suite node appears in a Python source file.

Leo's test commands first execute the script and then run suite in g.app.scriptDict.get('suite') using the standard unittest text runner.

You can organize the script in an @suite nodes just as usual using @others, section references, etc. For example::

    if g.unitTesting:
        __pychecker__ = '--no-reimport'
        import unittest
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional.
        # children define test1,test2..., subclasses of unittest.TestCase.
        @others 
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        for test in (test1,test2,test3,test4):
            suite.addTest(test)
        g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628094515.2">The run-all-unit-tests-locally and run-unit-tests-locally commands run unit tests in the process that is running Leo. These commands *can* change the outline containing the unit tests.

The run-all-unit-tests and run-unit-tests commands run all tests in a separate process, so unit tests can never have any side effects. These commands never changes the outline from which the tests were run. These commands do the following:

1. Copy all @test, @suite, @unit-tests and @mark-for-unit-test nodes (including their descendants) to the file test/dynamicUnitTest.leo.

2. Run test/leoDynamicTest.py in a separate process.

   - leoDynamicTest.py opens dynamicUnitTest.leo with the leoBridge module.
     Thus, all unit tests get run with the nullGui in effect.

   - After opening dynamicUnitTest.leo, leoDynamicTest.py runs all unit tests
     by executing the leoTest.doTests function.

   - The leoTests.doTests function searches for @test and @suite nodes and
     processes them generally as described above. The details are a bit
     different from as described, but they usually don't matter. If you *really*
     care, see the source code for leoTests.doTests.

The body text of the @enabled-plugins node contains a list of enabled plugins. Notes:

- Leo attempts to load all plugins every time an @enabled-plugins node is seen. If the plugin has already been loaded, Leo silently ignores the request to re-enable the plugin. Leo never attempts to disable a plugin while processing enabled plugin strings. Thus, plugins enabled in an @enabled-plugins node in leoSettings.leo *will* be enabled regardless of the contents of any other @enabled-plugins node.

- g.app.gui.getEnabledPlugins contains the last processed @enabled-plugins node.

<t tx="ekr.20070816092449">Question and answer from plumloco.

Add the equivalent of::

    import sys 
    leocore = "path/to/leo/core" 
    if leocore not in sys.path: sys.path.append(leocore) 
    import leo.core.leoBridge as leoBridge

at the head of each file that uses leoBridge.

The problem is not importing leoBridge itself but (if I use 'from leo.core') the importing of plugins, who get a different leoGlobals from leoBridge, without g.app etc, and so do not work if they rely on dynamic values in g.etc.

&gt; Why can't you simply add leo/core to sys.path in sitecustomize.py?

Putting leo/core on the python path as you suggest would put forty python modules in the global module namespace for all python programs when I want just one. Also, I have a safe working copy of leo and a cvs/testing version. I would wish to test any programs against the testing version while using the working version, but both /core directories can't be exposed at the same time.

&gt; Do you need plugins while running from the leoBridge? 

Afraid so, at least the rst3 plugin. The solution I am using now is to place::

    sys.modules['leoGlobals'] = leoGlobals  

in leoBridge after import leo.core.leoGlobals as leoGlobals

This allows my scripts to be portable over the several computers/platforms I need to use them on, and makes testing scripts against multiple leo versions easy. It does mean that my scripts are not portable to other leo users but that is not likely to be a problem.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20071026055929"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20071026055929.1">First, you must change Python's default encoding to something other than 'ascii'.  To do this, put the following in your sitecustomize.py file in Python's Lib folder::

    import sys 
    sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8') # 'iso-8859-1' is another choice.

You must restart Python after doing this: sys.setdefaultencoding can not be called after Python starts up.

Leo's g.es_print and g.pr functions attempts to convert incoming arguments to unicode using the default encoding. For example, the following Leo script shows various ways of printing La Peña properly::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    import sys
    e = sys.getdefaultencoding()
    print 'encoding',e
    table = (
        'La Peña',
        unicode('La Peña','utf-8'),
        u'La Peña',
        u'La Pe\\xf1a',
    )

    for s in table:
        print type(s)
        g.es_print('g.es_print',s)
        if type(s) != type(u'a'):
            s = unicode(s,e)
        print 'print     ',s
        print 'repr(s)   ',repr(s)

    g.app.gui.runAskOkCancelStringDialog(c,title,message)
    g.app.gui.runAskOkDialog(c,title,message=None,text='Ok')
    g.app.gui.runAskYesNoCancelDialog(c,title,message=None,
        yesMessage='Yes',noMessage='No',defaultButton='Yes')
    g.app.gui.runAskYesNoDialog(c,title,message=None)

The values returned are in ('ok','yes','no','cancel'), as indicated by the method names. Some dialogs also return strings or numbers, again as indicated by their names.

<t tx="ekr.20071210094621">This following is adapted from Terry Brown's entry in Leo's wiki.

You can not just run leoBridge from Leo, because the leoBridge module is designed to run a separate copy of Leo. However, it is possible to run leoBridge from a separate process. That turned out to be more, um, interesting than anticipated, so I'm recording the results here.

The idea is that script A running in Leo (i.e. in a regular GUI Leo session) calls script B through subprocess.Popen(), script B uses LeoBridge to do something (parse unloaded Leo files), and returns the result to script A. Passing the result back via the clipboard seemed like a possibility, but XWindows clipboard madness being what it is, that didn't seem to work.

First trick, calling script B from script A::

    import subprocess
    p = subprocess.Popen(('python',
        path_to_script_B,
        parameter_for_script_B,),
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        env={'PYTHONPATH': g.app.loadDir,'USER': g.app.leoID},
    )
    p.wait()

Setting PYTHONPATH in the environment seemed like the easiest way to let script B find leoBridge.py (which it needs to import).  But by setting the env parameter you limit script B's environment to be **only** PYTHONPATH, which causes leoBridge to fail because, in unix at least, it depends on USER in the environment.  So you need to pass that through, too.

Now, because passing stuff back on the clipboard seems unreliable, at least in XWindows, script B passes results back to script A via stdout (print), but there's some Leo initialization chatter you want to avoid.  So put a sentinel, 'START_CLIPBOARD', in the output, and collect it like this::

    response = p.stdout.readlines()
    while response and 'START_CLIPBOARD' not in response[0]:
        del response[0]
    del response[0]  # delete the sentinel as well
    response = ''.join(response)

This is the basic mechanism.  What I *actually* wanted to do was have script B generate a branch of nodes and pass that back to script A for insertion in the tree script A is running in.  That's relatively easy if you use::

    c.setCurrentPosition(pos_of_branch_to_return)
    c.copyOutline()
    print '&lt;!-- START_CLIPBOARD --&gt;'
    print g.app.gui.getTextFromClipboard()
    print '&lt;!-- END_CLIPBOARD --&gt;'

at the end of script B. Back in script A, after you've rebuilt
`response` as shown above, do::

    g.app.gui.replaceClipboardWith(response)
    c.pasteOutline()

A relative path is recommended if you plan to use the icons on machines with different directory structures.

For example::

    path = 'rt_arrow_disabled.gif' 
    c.editCommands.insertIconFromFile(path)

It is easy to translate Leo's menu strings: simply create an @menus tree in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo that contains the translated menu names.

**New in Leo 4.4.8**: Leo now contains support for translating messages sent to Leo's log:

- Rather than using an '_' function to denote strings to be translated, Leo's g.es and g.es_print functions translate "odd" (first, third, fifth) arguments, leaving "even" arguments untranslated. Keyword arguments, color, newline, etc. are never translated.

- All calls to g.es and g.es_print in Leo's core follow this convention.

- g.translateString does the actual translation using Python's `gettext`_ module.

- You can use the script in the node "@button print g.es stats" in scripts.leo to create catalogs of all scripts that need to be translated. Such catalogs are used by Python's gettext module. (This script was also used to check that the proper arguments to g.es and g.es_print were translated.)

<t tx="ekr.20080411111008.1">Leo ignores any subtree of an @settings tree whose headline starts with @ignore.

You can use several other kinds of nodes to cause Leo to ignore parts of  an @settings tree:

- @if *expression*

  A node whose headline starts with @if *expression* acts like an organizer node if the expression evaluates to True, otherwise acts like an @ignore node. If the expression is empty the body text should contain a script that will be evaluated (in an empty context).

- @ifplatform *platform-name*

  Same as @if sys.platform == "platform-name": except that it isn't necessary to import sys.

- @ifhostname *hostA,!hostB*

  Evaluates to True if and only if: h=g.computeMachineName(); h==hostA and h!=hostB. The "!" version allows matching to every machine name except the given one to allow differing settings on only a few machines.

<t tx="ekr.20080412124815.1"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20080527063511.1">I had a need to figure out why a part of some python code I had written was taking too long. I pulled the code into Leo and the relevant part of the outline looked something like this::

    + Main module
    -- Generate cryptographic key
    -- Hashing algorithm

etc. So I cloned just the segment I wanted to profile and pulled it under a new section::

    + Main module
    -- [clone] Generate cryptographic key
    -- Hashing algorithm

    + Profiling Experiment
    -- [clone] Generate cryptographic key

And in the body of the "Profiling experiment", I used this code::

    code_under_here = """
    @others
    """

    from timeit import Timer
    t = Timer("print my_key_generator()", code_under_here)
    print t.timeit(number = 10)

And then I hit Control-B to execute the Profiling Experiment body. This let me make adjustments to the code in the clone body and keep hitting Control-B to execute the code with the timeit module to see immediately if what I had done was making a difference.

The great thing about this was that I just used the Leo @others construct to create a wrapper around the code and did not need to litter my code with debug or profiling statements.---Kayvan

<t tx="ekr.20080603124653.1">Many users will want to track the development version of Leo, in order to stay on top of the latest features and bug fixes. Running the development version is quite safe and easy, and it's also a requirement if you want to contribute to Leo.

1. First, you need to get git from http://git-scm.com/.

2. Get Leo from GitHub by doing::

        git clone https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor (http access)
    
   or::
   
        git clone git@github.com:leo-editor/leo-editor.git (ssh access)

And that's it! You can run the launchLeo script (in the top-level branch directory) directly. When you want to refresh the code with latest modifications from GitHub, 'run git pull'.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080729064227.6">The timit button in unitTest.leo allows you to apply Python's timeit module. See http://docs.python.org/lib/module-timeit.html. The contents of @button timer is::

    import leo.core.leoTest as leoTest
    leoTest.runTimerOnNode(c,p,count=100)

runTimerOnNode executes the script in the presently selected node using timit.Timer and prints the results.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080729064227.7">The profile button in unitTest.leo allows you to profile nodes using Python's profiler module. See http://docs.python.org/lib/module-profile.html The contents of @button profile is::

    import leo.core.leoTest as leoTest
    leoTest.runProfileOnNode(p,outputPath=None) # Defaults to leo\test\profileStats.txt

runProfileOnNode runs the Python profiler on the script in the selected node, then reports the stats.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080730212711.52">There are several boundary cases that the update algorithm can not resolve.
For example, if a line is inserted between nodes, the algorithm can not
determine whether the line should be inserted at the end of one node or the
start of the next node. Let us call such lines **ambiguous lines**.

The algorithm *guesses* that ambiguous lines belongs at the end of a node
rather than at the start of the next node. This is usually what is
wanted--we usually insert lines at the end of a node.

Happily, **guesses don't matter**, for the following reasons:

1. The external file that results from writing the @clean x tree will be
   the same as the updated external file *no matter where* ambiguous lines
   are placed. In other words, the update algorithm is **sound**.

2. Leo reports nodes that were changed when reading any external file. The
   user can review changes to @clean and @file trees in the same way.

3. The user can permanently correct any mistaken guess. Guesses only happen
   for *newly inserted or changed* lines. Moving an ambiguous line to the
   following node will not change the external file. As a result, the
   next time Leo reads the file the line will be placed in the correct node!

This proves that @shadow and @clean are easy and safe to use. The
remaining sections of this document discuss code-level details.

<t tx="ekr.20080813064908.2">In version 4.5, Leo changed to using a sax parser for .leo files. This can cause problems if your .leo file contains invalid characters. Bugs in previous versions of Leo permitted these bad characters to appear.

The sax parser complains that these characters are not valid in .xml files. Remove these invalid characters as follows:

1. `run Leo in a console window`_, and load the .leo file. Near the bottom of the error message you will see a line like::

    SAXParseException: &lt;unknown&gt;:123:25: not well-formed (invalid token)

This line reports a bad character at character 25 of line 123.

2. Open the .leo file in an external editor. The Scite editor, http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html, is a good choice because it clearly shows non-printing characters. Remove the invalid character, save the .leo file.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all invalid characters are gone.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080922124033.1">The following code can be run from a script to get input from the user using the minibuffer::

    def getInput (event=None):

       stateName = 'get-input'
       k = c.k
       state = k.getState(stateName)

       if state == 0:
           k.setLabelBlue('Input: ',protect=True)
           k.getArg(event,stateName,1,getInput)
       else:
           k.clearState()
           g.es_print('input: %s' % k.arg)

    getInput()

Let's look at this in detail.  The lines::

    stateName = 'get-input'
    k = c.k
    state = k.getState(stateName)

define a state *name*, 'get-input', unique to this code. k.getState returns the present state (an int) associated with this state.

When getInput() is first called, the state returned by k.getState will be 0, so the following lines are executed::

    if state == 0:
        k.setLabelBlue('Input: ',protect=True)
        k.getArg(event,stateName,1,getInput)

These lines put a protected label in the minibuffer: the user can't delete the label by backspacing. getArg, and the rest of Leo's key handling code, take care of the extremely complex details of handling key strokes in states. The call to getArg never returns. Instead, when the user has finished entering the input by typing &lt;Return&gt; getArg calls getInput so that k.getState will return state 1, the value passed as the third argument to k.getArg. The following lines handle state 1::

    else:
        k.clearState()
        g.es_print('input: %s' % k.arg)

k.arg is the value returned by k.getArg. This example code just prints the value of k.arg and clears the input state.

<t tx="ekr.20080923182326.1">This option applies to directories specified in filenames in all kinds of @file trees, and to filenames specified in the @path directive.

True:  Leo attempts to create directories if they do not exist.
False: Leo never attempts to create directories.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20081205084002.2">Scripts can easily determine what directives are in effect at a particular position in an outline. c.scanAllDirectives(p) returns a Python dictionary whose keys are directive names and whose values are the value in effect at position p. For example::

    d = c.scanAllDirectives(p) g.es(g.dictToString(d))

In particular, d.get('path') returns the full, absolute path created by all @path directives that are in ancestors of node p. If p is any kind of @file node (including @file, @auto, @clean, etc.), the following script will print the full path to the created file::

    path = d.get('path')
    name = p.anyAtFileNodeName()
    if name:
       name = g.os_path_finalize_join(path,name)
       g.es(name)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.10">\@menuat modifies the menu tree created by @menus. This allows settings in myLeoSettings.leo to change menus without copying the entire menu tree from leoSettings.leo. This ensures you don’t miss out when new things are added in the @menus in leoSettings.leo, as you would if you replaced the @menus in leoSettings.leo with one in myLeoSettings.leo.

\@menuat should occur in a @settings tree, but not as a descendant of a @menus tree. Its children are @menu and @item nodes as for the @menu setting.

The @menuat setting has 2-3 parameters in its head text]::

    @menuat *&lt;path&gt;* *&lt;action&gt;* *[clipboard]*

The path argument specifies a **target** in the menu tree as defined by @menus and modified by earlier @menuat settings. The path takes the form::

    /entry1/entry2/entry3
    
Each entry is the **cleaned** name of a menu or item. Cleaned names are a name with all text except a-z and 0-9 removed and upper case letters converted to lower case. For example, specify::

    Outline-&gt;Move-&gt;Move Down
    
as::
    
     /outline/move/movedown

The action argument specifies what the menu item does. There are 5 available actions:

- **before**: Insert items and sub menus immediately before the target.
- **after**:  Insert items and sub menus immediately after the target.
- **append**: Append items and sub menus at the end of the target menu or item.
- **cut**:    Remove the target from the menu tree and save it to an internal clipboard.
- **copy**:   Copy the target to an internal clipboard. Descendants of the @menuat setting are ignored.

The cut and copy arguments ignore descendants of the @menuat setting .

The optional clipboard argument modifies the action of the before, after, and append actions. By default these actions insert the menus and items supplied as descendants of the @menuat setting. If you specify “clipboard” (without the quotes) as the source, the contents of the clipboard from a previous cut or copy action will be used instead.

<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.11">The body text contains a list of settings for a font.  For example::

    body_text_font_family = Courier New
    body_text_font_size = None
    body_text_font_slant = None
    body_text_font_weight = None

**Important**: you can use the show-fonts minibuffer command to guide you in making these settings.

<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.12">The body text contains a list of shortcut specifiers.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.13">The body text contains a list of paths of recently opened files, one path per line. Leo writes the list of recent files to .leoRecentFiles.txt in Leo's config directory, again one file per line.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.14">Leo allows you to specify input modes. You enter mode x with the enter-x-mode command. The purpose of a mode is to create different bindings for keys within a mode. Often plain keys are useful in input modes.

You can specify modes with @mode nodes in leoSettings.leo. @mode nodes work just like @shortcuts nodes, but in addition they have the side effect of creating the enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode command.

The form of this node is::

    @mode *&lt;mode name&gt;*

The body text contains a list of shortcut specifiers. @mode nodes work just like @shortcuts nodes, but in addition they have the side effect of creating the enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode command.

Notes:

- You can exit any mode using the keyboard-quit (Control-g) command. This is the **only** binding that is automatically created in each mode. All other bindings must be specified in the @mode node. In particular, the bindings specified in @shortcuts nodes are **not** in effect in mode (again, except for the keyboard-quit binding).

- Leo supports something akin to tab completion within modes: if you type a key that isn't bound in a mode a 'Mode' tab will appear in the log pane. This tab shows all the keys that you can type and the commands to which they are bound. The mode-help command does the same thing.

- @shortcuts nodes specify the bindings for what might be called the 'top-level' mode. These are the bindings in effect when no internal state is present, for example, just after executing the keyboard-quit command.

- The top_level_unbound_key_action setting determines what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode. Leo ignores unbound keys in all other modes. The possibilities are 'insert', 'replace' and 'ignore'.

- The set-insert-mode, set-overwrite-mode and set-ignore-mode commands alter what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode.
  
- If the @mode headline contains ::, everything following the :: is the mode prompt. For example::
    
    @mode abc :: xyz
    
Creates the enter-abc-mode command, but the prompt for the command is xyz.

With all these options it should be possible to emulate the keyboard behavior of any other editor.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.2">When reading a .leo file, Leo looks for settings in default settings files first, then settings in personal settings files, and finally settings in local settings files.  The exact search order is:

1. Default settings files:

   a. configDir/leoSettings.leo
   b. homeDir/leoSettings.leo
   c. localDir/leoSettings.leo

2. Personal settings files:

   a. configDir/myLeoSettings.leo
   b. homeDir/myLeoSettings.leo
   c. homeDir/&lt;machine-name&gt;LeoSettings.leo (note capitalization)
   d. localDir/myLeoSettings.leo

3. Local settings files:

   a. The file specified by the -c command-line option.
   b. The file being loaded.

Settings that appear later in this list override settings that appear earlier in this list.  This happens on a setting-by-setting basis, *not* on a file-by-file basis.  In other words, each individual setting overrides only the *corresponding* setting in previously-read files.  Reading a setting file does *not* reset all previous settings. Note that the same file might appear several times in the search list. Leo detects such duplicate file names and only loads each settings file once. Leo remembers all the settings in settings files and does not reread those settings when reading another .leo file.

**Caution**: This search order offers almost too much flexibility. This can be confusing, even for power users. It's important to choose the "simplest configuration scheme that could possibly work".  Something like:

- Use a single leoSettings.leo file for installation-wide defaults.
- Use a single myLeoSettings.leo files for personal defaults.
- Use local settings sparingly.

**Important**: it is good style to limit settings placed in myLeoSettings.leo to those settings that differ from default settings.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.3">You should use special care when placing default or personal settings files in **local** directories, that is, directories other than homeDir, configDir or machineDir. In particular, the value of localDir can change when Leo reads additional files. This can result in Leo finding new default and personal settings files. The values of these newly-read settings files will, as always, override any previously-read settings.

Let us say that a setting is **volatile** if it is different from a default setting. Let us say that settings file A.leo **covers** settings file if B.leo if all volatile settings in B.leo occur in A.leo. With these definitions, the **safe rule** for placing settings files in local directories is::

   Settings files in local directories should
   cover all other settings files.

Following this rule will ensure that the per-directory defaults specified in the local settings file will take precedence over all previously-read default and personal settings files. Ignore this principle at your peril.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.5">An @buttons tree in a settings file defines global buttons that are created in the icon area of all .leo files. All @button nodes in the @commands tree create global buttons. All @button nodes outside the commands tree create buttons local to the settings file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.6">An @commands tree in a settings file defines global commands. All @command nodes in the @commands tree create global commands. All @command nodes outside the commands tree create commands local to the settings file.

<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.7">The body text contains a list of strings, one per line. Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.8" str_atime="1376412853.0">The body text of the @enabled plugins node contains a list of enabled plugins, one per line. Comment lines starting with '#' are ignored. Leo loads plugins in the order they appear. **Important**: Leo handles @enabled-plugins nodes a differently from other kinds of settings. To avoid confusion, **please read the following carefully**.

As always, Leo looks for @enabled-plugins nodes in settings files in the order specified by `Search order for settings files`_. Leo will enable all plugins found in the @enabled-plugins node it finds *last* in the search order. Leo does *not* enable plugins found in any other @enabled-plugins node. In particular, **you can not specify a list of default plugins by placing that list in a settings file that appears early in the search list**. Instead, the last @enabled-plugins node found in the search list specifies all and *only* the plugins that will be enabled.

Let us distinguish two different situations. First, what Leo does when loading a file, say x.leo. Second, what Leo does when loading a second file, say y.leo, *from x.leo*. When loading the first .leo file, Leo enables plugins from the
@enabled-plugins node it finds *last* in the search order. But after plugins
have *already* been loaded and enabled, there is no way to disable previously
loaded-and-enabled plugins. But local settings files can enable additional
plugins.

To avoid confusion, I highly recommend following another kind of safe rule. We say that an @enabled-plugin node in file A.leo **covers** an @enabled-plugin node in file B.leo if all plugins specified in B's @enabled-plugin node appear A's @enabled-plugin node. The safe rule for plugins is::

  @enabled-plugin nodes in settings files in local directories
  should cover @enabled-plugins nodes in all other settings files.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.9">Leo creates its menus from the @menu, @item and @popup nodes in the @menus tree. Within @menus trees, @menu nodes create menus and @item nodes create menu items.

The menu name always follows @menu. If the menu name is 'Plugins', Leo will create the Plugins menu and populate the menu by calling the 'create-optional-menus' hook. This creates the Plugins menu as usual. Nested @menu nodes define submenus.

The command name follows @item. If the body text of an @item node exists, this body text is the menu name. Otherwise, the menu name is the command name. However, if the command name starts with a '*', hyphens are removed from the menu name. Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&amp;). If present, the following character is underlined in the name. If the command name in an @item node is just a hyphen (-), the item represents a menu separator.

\@popup *&lt;widget-name&gt;* creates a popup menu for use by the contextmenu.py plugin. The children of this node should be @menu and @item nodes, used as with @menus.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116130002.1">Settings files can be found in the following directories:

To tell the rst3 plugin to generate an intermediate file, do::

    write_intermediate_file = True

After you create the intermediate file, in this case, test.html.txt, You can create an odt file as follows::

    python &lt;path-to-python&gt;/scripts/rst2odt.py test.html.txt test.odt

I a batch file, rst2odt.bat, like this:

    rst2odt test

Note that rst3odt.py is in the tools directory of the DocUtils distribution.

To generate .rtf, you can use PanDoc to convert test.html.txt to RTF.

To generate .pdf files, you would first convert test.html.txt to LaTeX::

    python rst2newlatex.py test.html.txt test.tex

    -- OR --

    cd leo\docs\html

You can then use one of the LaTeX to .pdf converters to create the final .pdf file. See http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/latex.html#pdf-generation for details.

    "Leo should either replace or greatly augment the development tools
    that I use."---Zak Greant

    "Leo is a quantum leap for me in terms of how many projects I can manage
    and how much information I can find and organize and store in a
    useful way."---Dan Winkler

Leo looks like other outlining programs, but it is not. This tutorial will get you using Leo quickly, acquainting you with its unique features in one or two hours. It has five parts.

The first three parts are for all users. They will take about an hour to complete. Part one introduces Leo's basic operations for creating and changing outlines. Part two tells how to use Leo as a Personal Information Manager. Part three tells how to create HTML, PDF, LaTeX and other documents.

The last two parts are for computer programmers; they assume some familiarity with `Python`_ programming. They will take another hour to complete. Part four tells how to create external files (files on your file system) from Leo outlines. Part five tells how to write Leo scripts, Python scripts run from any Leo node.

<t tx="ekr.20100122073254.11655">This section describes the process of creating an importer for a new language. There are a set of "importers" in leoImport.py, all based on the baseScannerClass class. You can define your own importer by creating a subclass. This shouldn't be too difficult: baseScannerClass is supposed to do almost all the work. With luck, your subclass might be very simple, as with class cScanner.

**Important** As I write this, I realize that I remember very little about the code, but I do remember its general organization and the process of creating a new importer. The following should be all you need to write any importer.

This base class has three main parts:

1. The "parser" that recognizes where nodes begin and end.

2. The "code generator" the actually creates the imported nodes.

3. Checking code that ensures that the imported code is equivalent to the original code.

You should never have to change the code generators or the checking code. Confine your attention to the parser.

The parser thinks it is looking for classes, and within classes, method definitions.  Your job is to tell the parser how to do this. Let's look at part of the ctor for baseScannerClass for clues::

   # May be overridden in subclasses.
   self.anonymousClasses = [] # For Delphi Pascal interfaces.
   self.blockCommentDelim1 = None
   self.blockCommentDelim2 = None
   self.blockCommentDelim1_2 = None
   self.blockCommentDelim2_2 = None
   self.blockDelim1 = '{'
   self.blockDelim2 = '}'
   self.blockDelim2Cruft = [] # Stuff that can follow .blockDelim2.
   self.classTags = ['class',] # tags that start a tag.
   self.functionTags = []
   self.hasClasses = True
   self.hasFunctions = True
   self.lineCommentDelim = None
   self.lineCommentDelim2 = None
   self.outerBlockDelim1 = None
   self.outerBlockDelim2 = None
   self.outerBlockEndsDecls = True
   self.sigHeadExtraTokens = [] # Extra tokens valid in head of signature.
   self.sigFailTokens = []
       # A list of strings that abort a signature when seen in a tail.
       # For example, ';' and '=' in C.
   self.strict = False # True if leading whitespace is very significant.

Yes, this looks like gibberish. I do *not* remember what all these things do in detail, although obviously the names mean something. What I *do* remember is that these ivars control the operation of the startsFunction and startsClass methods and their helpers (especially startsHelper) and the methods that call them, scan and scanHelper. Most of these methods have a trace var that will enable tracing during importing.

So the strategy is simple: study startsHelper in detail, set the ivars above to make startsHelper do what you want, and trace until things work as you want.

There is one more detail. Sometimes the ivars above are not sufficient to get the job done. In that case, subclasses will override various methods of the parser, but *not* the code generator. If indentation is important, you will want to look at the Python importer. Notice that it overrides skipCodeBlock, called by startsHelper.

That's about it. It would be pointless to give you more details, because those details would lead you *away* from the process you need to follow. Having said that, feel free to ask further questions. I'll be glad to answer them.

For example, the following modifies the cleo.py plugin after Leo has completed loading it::

    def prikey(self, v):
        try:
            pa = int(self.getat(v, 'priority'))
        except ValueError:
            pa = -1

        if pa == 24:
            pa = -1
        if pa == 10:
            pa = -2

        return pa

    def on_create(tag, keywords):
        c.cleo.prikey = types.MethodType(prikey, c.cleo, c.cleo.__class__)

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("after-create-leo-frame",on_create)

Attempting to modify c.cleo.prikey immediately in the @script gives an AttributeError as c has no .cleo when the @script is executed. Deferring it by using registerHandler() avoids the problem.

Hoist &amp; dehoist

    Hoisting a node redraws the screen that node and its descendants becomes the
    only visible part of the outline. Leo prevents the you from moving nodes
    outside the hoisted outline. Dehoisting a node restores the outline.
    Multiple hoists may be in effect: each dehoist undoes the effect of the
    immediately preceding hoist.

    pair: Organizer node; Glossary

Organizer node

    A node containing no body text. Organizing nodes may appear anywhere in an
    @file tree; they do not affect the external file in any way. In particular,
    organizing nodes do not affect indentation in external files.

.. index::
    pair: Orphan node; Glossary

Orphan node

    A node that would not be copied to a external file. Orphan nodes can arise
    because an @file tree has no @others or @all directives. Sections that are
    defined but not used also create orphan nodes.

    Leo issues a warning when attempting to write an @file tree containing
    orphan nodes, and does not save the external file. No information is lost;
    Leo saves the information in the @file tree in the .leo file. Leo will load
    the @file tree from the .leo file the next time Leo opens the .leo file.

Settings:

    Plugins and other parts of Leo can get options from @settings trees,
    outlines whose headline is @settings. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks
    for @settings trees in the outline being opened and also in various
    leoSettings.leo files. @settings trees allow plugins to get options without
    any further support from Leo's core code. For a full discussion of @settings

<t tx="ekr.20100804133903.7262">This section is a reference guide for all other Leo directives, organized alphabetically.

Unless otherwise noted, all directives listed are valid only in body text, and they must start at the leftmost column of the node.

.. glossary::
     :sorted:

.. index::
    pair: @; Reference
.. index::
    pair: @doc; Reference
.. index::
    pair: Doc part; Reference

\@ and \@doc

    These directives start a doc part. @doc is a synonym for @. Doc parts
    continue until an @c directive or the end of the body text. For example::

        @ This is a comment in a doc part.
        Doc parts can span multiple lines.
        The next line ends the doc part
        @c

    When writing external files, Leo writes doc parts as comments.

    Leo does not recognize @ or @doc in @asis trees or when the @all or
    @delims directives are in effect.

.. index::
    pair: @c; Reference
.. index::
    pair: @code; Reference

\@c and @code

    Ends any doc part and starts a code part.

    \@code is a deprecated synonym for @c.

    Leo does not recognize this directive in @asis trees or when the
    @all or @raw directives are in effect.

.. index::
    pair: @chapter; Reference
.. index::
    pair: @chapters; Reference

\@chapter and @chapters

    An @chapter tree represents a chapter. All @chapter nodes should be
    contained in an @chapters node.

    These directives are too complex to describe here. For full details, see
    `Using Chapters`_.

    These directives must appear in the node's headline.

.. index::
    pair: @encoding; Reference

\@encoding &lt;encoding&gt;

    Specifies the Unicode encoding for an external file. For example::

        @encoding iso-8859-1

    When reading external files, the encoding given must match the encoding
    actually used in the external file or "byte hash" will result.

.. index::
    pair: @first; Reference

\@first &lt;text&gt;

    Places lines at the very start of an external file, before any Leo
    sentinels. @first lines must be the very first lines in an @&lt;file&gt; node.
    More then one @first lines may appear.

    This creates two first lines, a shebang line and a Python encoding line::

        @first #! /usr/bin/env python
        @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    Here is a perl example::

        @first #!/bin/sh -- # perl, to stop looping
        @first eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -w -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
        @first     if 0;

\@ignore

    Tells Leo to ignore the subtree in which it appears.

    In the body text of most top-level @&lt;file&gt; nodes, the @ignore directive
    causes Leo not to write the tree. However, Leo ignores @ignore directives
    in @asis trees.

    Plugins and other parts of Leo sometimes @ignore for their own purposes. For
    example, Leo's unit testing commands will ignore trees containing @ignore.
    In such cases, the @ignore directive may appear in the headline or body
    text.

.. index::
    pair: @language; Reference

\@language &lt;language name&gt;

    Specifies the language in effect, including comment delimiters.
    If no @language directive is in effect, Leo uses the defaults specified
    by the @string target-language setting.

    A node may contain at most one @language directive.

    The valid language names are: actionscript, ada, autohotkey, batch, c, config,
    cpp, csharp, css, cweb, elisp, forth, fortran, fortran90, haskell, haxe,
    html, ini, java, javascript, kshell, latex, lua, noweb, pascal, perl,
    perlpod, php, plain, plsql, python, rapidq, rebol, rest, rst, ruby, shell,
    tcltk, tex, unknown, unknown_language, vim, vimoutline, xml, xslt.

    **Note**: Shell files have comments that start with #.

    Case is ignored in the language names. For example, the following are
    equivalent::

        @language html
        @language HTML

    The @language directive also controls syntax coloring. For language x, the
    file leo/modes/x.py describes how to colorize the language. To see the
    languages presently supported, look in the leo/modes directory. There are
    over 100 such languages.

.. index::
    pair: @last; Reference

\@last &lt;text&gt;

    Places lines at the very end of external files.

    This directive must occur at the very end of top-level @&lt;file&gt; nodes. More
    than one @last directive may exist. For example::

        @first &lt;?php
        ...
        @last ?&gt;

    Leo does not recognize @last directive in @asis trees.

.. index::
    pair: @lineending; Reference

\@lineending cr/lf/nl/crlf

    Sets the line endings for external files.
    This directive overrides the @string output_newline setting.

    The valid forms of the @lineending directive are:

    ========================   ======================================================
    \@lineending nl            The default, Linux.
    ------------------------   ------------------------------------------------------
    \@lineending cr            Mac
    ------------------------   ------------------------------------------------------
    \@lineending crlf          Windows
    ------------------------   ------------------------------------------------------
    \@lineending lf            Same as 'nl', not recommended
    ------------------------   ------------------------------------------------------
    \@lineending platform      Same as platform value for output_newline setting.
    ========================   ======================================================

.. index::
    pair: @nowrap; Reference

\@nowrap

    Disables line wrapping the Leo's body pane.

    Only the first @wrap or @nowrap directive in a node has any effect.

    @nowrap may appear in either headlines or body text.

.. index::
    pair: @pagewidth; Reference

\@pagewidth &lt;n&gt;

   Sets the page width used to break doc parts into lines.
   &lt;n&gt; should be a positive integer.  For example::

      @pagewidth 100

  The @pagewidth directive overrides the @int page_width setting.

.. index::
    pair: @path; Reference
.. index::
    pair: Absolute path; Reference
.. index::
    pair: Path prefix; Reference

\@path &lt;path&gt;

   Sets the **path prefix** for relative filenames for all @&lt;file&gt; tree.

   This directive may appear in headlines or body text, and may
   appear in top-level @&lt;file&gt; nodes.

   The path is an **absolute path** if it begins with c:\\ or /,
   otherwise the path is a **relative** paths.

   Multiple @path directives may contribute to the path prefix.
   Absolute paths overrides any ancestor @path directives.
   Relative paths add to the path prefix.

   If no @path directives are in effect, the default path prefix is
   the directory containing the .leo file.

   Within @path and @&lt;file&gt; paths, {{exp}} gets evaluated with the following
   symbols known: c, g, p, os and sys.  For example::

       @file {{os.path.abspath(os.curdir)}}/abc.py

   refers to the file abc.py in (absolute path of) the current directory.

.. index::
    pair: @tabwidth; Reference
.. index::
    pair: Negative tab width; Reference

\@tabwidth &lt;n&gt;

  Sets the width of tabs.
  Negative tab widths cause Leo to convert tabs to spaces.

.. index::

\@wrap

    Enables line wrapping in Leo's body pane.

    Only the first @wrap or @nowrap directive in a node has any effect.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4393">.. index::
    pair: @asis; Reference

The @asis directive creates an external file without sentinels and without any expansions.

Use this directive only when you must have complete control over every character of the external file. When writing @asis nodes, writes the body text of all nodes in outline order. Leo writes the body text *as is*, without recognizing section definitions, without expanding section references, and without treating directives specially in any way. In particular, Leo copies all directives, including @ or @c directives, to the external file as text.

.. index::
    pair: @@ convention in @asis trees; Reference

**The @@ convention**: Within @asis trees only, if a headline starts with @@, Leo writes everything in the headline following the @@ just before the corresponding body text.

Files created from @asis trees contain *nothing* not contained in body text (or
@@ headlines). In particular, if body text does not end in a newline, the first
line from the next node will concatenated to the last line of the preceding node.

Within @asis trees, Leo writes no sentinels to the external file, so Leo can not update the outline using changes to the external file. When reading .leo files, Leo does *not* read external files created from @asis nodes. Instead, all data in an @asis tree is stored in the .leo file.

Within @asis trees, Leo recognizes the @ignore directive only in the *ancestors* of @asis nodes. This allows you to use the @ignore directive to prevent Leo from writing @asis trees.

**Note**: @file-asis and @silent are deprecated synonyms for @asis.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4395">.. index::
    pair: @edit; Reference

The @edit directive imports an external file into a single node.

When reading @edit nodes, Leo reads the entire file into the @edit node. Lines
that look like sentinels will be read just as they are.

When writing @edit nodes, @edit nodes must not have children and section
references and @others are not allowed.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4396">.. index::
    pair: @auto; Reference

The @auto directive imports an external file into a tree of nodes.

**Important**: As of Leo 5.1, @clean is recommended instead of @auto.

@auto trees allow people to use Leo in collaborative environments without using
sentinels in external files. Even without sentinels, @auto trees can change
when the corresponding external file changes outside of Leo.

.. index::
    pair: Importer; Reference

When reading @auto nodes, Leo creates the @auto tree using **importers**,
parsers that create an outline with nodes for each class, method and function in
the external file. Some importers create other kinds of nodes as well.

Importers presently exist for C, elisp, HTML, .ini files, Java, Javascript, Pascal, PHP, Python and xml. Leo determines the language using the file's extension. If no parser exists for a language, Leo copies the entire body of the external file into the @auto node.

.. index::
    pair: Organizer tag; Reference

**Note**: the @data import_xml_tags setting specifies the **organizer tags** that cause the HTML and XML importers to create outline nodes. By default, the **organizer tags** are html, body, head, and div.

When writing @auto nodes, Leo writes the external file without sentinels. This allows you to use Leo in collaborative environments without disturbing colleagues.

When importing files into @auto trees, Leo performs several checks to ensure that writing the imported file will produce exactly the same file. These checks can produces **errors** or **warnings**. Errors indicate a potentially serious problem. Leo inserts an @ignore directive in the @auto tree if any error is found. This prevents the @auto tree from modifying the external file.

.. index::
    pair: Strict language; Reference

Before importing a file, Leo **regularizes** the leading whitespace of all lines of the original source file. That is, Leo converts blanks to tabs or tabs to blanks depending on the value of the @tabwidth directive in effect for the @auto node. Leo also checks that the indentation of any non-blank line is a multiple of the indentation specified by the @tabwidth directive. **Strict languages** are languages such as Python for which leading whitespace must be preserved exactly as it appears in the original source file. Problems during regularizing whitespace generate errors for strict languages and warnings for non-strict languages.

After importing a file, Leo verifies that writing the @auto node would create the same file as the original file. Such file comparison mismatches generate errors unless the problem involves only leading whitespace for non-strict languages. Whenever a mismatch occurs the first non-matching line is printed.

File comparison mismatches can arise for several reasons:

1. Bugs in the import parsers. Please report any such bugs immediately.

2. Underindented lines in classes, methods or function.

.. index::
    pair: Underindented line; Reference

An **underindented line** is a line of body text that is indented less then the starting line of the class, method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not represent such lines exactly: every line in an external file will have at least the indentation of any unindented line of the corresponding node in the outline. Leo will issue a warning (not an error) for underindented Python comment lines. Such lines can not change the meaning of Python programs.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4398">The @color, @killcolor, @nocolor and @nocolor-node directives control how
Leo colors text in the body pane.

.. index::
    pair: Ambiguous node; Reference

These directives typically affect the node in which they appear and all descendant nodes. Exception: an **ambiguous node**, a node containing both @color and @nocolor directives, has no effect on how Leo colors text in descendant nodes.

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

.. index::
    pair: @color; Reference

\@color

    Enables syntax coloring until the next @nocolor directive.

.. index::
    pair: @killcolor; Reference

\@killcolor

    Disables syntax coloring in a node, overriding all @color, @nocolor or
    @nocolor-node directives in the same node.

.. index::
    pair: @nocolor; Reference

\@nocolor

    Disables syntax coloring until the next @nocolor directive.

.. index::
    pair: @nocolor-node; Reference

\@nocolor-node

    Disables coloring for only the node containing it. The @nocolor-node
    directive overrides the @color and @nocolor directives within the same
    node.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4399">.. index::
    pair: @clean; Reference

The @clean &lt;filename&gt; creates an external file without sentinel lines.
@clean trees will probably be the most convenient way of creating and
accessing external files for most people.

When writing an @clean tree, Leo expands section references, @all and
@others directives, but Leo writes no sentinels to the external file.

.. _`Mulder/Ream update algorithm`: http://leoeditor.com/appendices.html#the-mulder-ream-update-algorithm

When reading an @clean tree, Leo propagates changes from the external file
to the @clean tree using the `Mulder/Ream update algorithm`_.

**Note**: The @bool force_newlines_in_at_nosent_bodies setting controls whether
Leo writes a trailing newline if non-empty body text does not end in a newline.
The default is True.

<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4402">.. index::
    pair: @shadow; Reference
    pair: Private file; Reference
    pair: Public file; Reference
    
**Important**: As of Leo 5.1, @shadow is **deprecated** Use @clean instead. @clean is faster than @shadow and requires no hidden files.

The @shadow directive creates *two* external files, a **public** file without sentinels, and a **private** file containing sentinels.

.. _`Mulder/Ream update algorithm`: http://leoeditor.com/appendices.html#the-mulder-ream-update-algorithm

When reading an @shadow node, Leo uses the `Mulder/Ream update algorithm`_ to compare the public and private files, then updates the outline based on changes to the *public* file.

Leo can do an initial import of @shadow trees by parsing the corresponding public file, exactly as is done for @auto nodes.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4403">.. index::
    pair: @file; Reference
    pair: @thin; Reference

The @file directive creates an external file containing sentinels. When writing
@file trees, Leo expands section references and @all and @others directives.

When reading external files created by @file, the sentinels allow Leo to
recreate all aspects of the outline. In particular, Leo can update the
outline based on changes made to the file by another editor. 

**Important**: @file is the recommended way to create and edit most
files. In particular, using @file nodes is **highly recommended**
when sharing external files in a collaborative environment. The @all
directivive is designed for "catch-all" files, like todo.txt or
notes.txt or whatever. Such files are assumed to contain a random
collection of nodes, so there is no language in effect and no real
comment delimiters.

The @thin directive is a synonym for @file.

Prior to Leo 4.7, @file worked differently from @thin. This should not be
a problem: Leo 4.7 can read all external files written by Leo 4.6.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4408">These directives alter how Leo represents data in external files. They are **dangerous**--mistakes in using these sentinels can make it impossible for Leo to read the resulting external file. Use them with care!

Nevertheless, these sentinels can be useful in special situations.

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

.. index::
    pair: @comment; Reference

\@comment &lt;1, 2 or three comment delims&gt;

    Sets the comment delimiters in @file and @shadow files.
    **Important**: Use @comment for unusual situations only. In most cases, you
    should use the @language directive to set comment delimiters.

    The @comment directive may be followed by one, two or three delimiters,
    separated by whitespace. If one delimiter is given, it sets the delimiter
    used by single-line comments. If two delimiters are given, they set the
    block comment delimiter. If three delimiters are given, the first sets the
    single-line-comment delimiter, and the others set the block-comment
    delimiters.

    Within these delimiters, underscores represent a significant space, and
    double underscores represent a newline. Examples::

        @comment REM_
        @comment __=pod__ __=cut__

    The second line sets PerlPod comment delimiters.

    **Warning**: the @comment and @delims directives **must not** appear in
    the same node. Doing so may create a file that Leo can not read.

    **Note**: @language and @comment may appear in the same node, provided
    that @comment appears *after* the @language directive: @comment overrides
    @language.

    The @comment directive must precede the first section name or @c
    directive.
    
    There are situations where using @delims or @comment is not avoidable or impractical to
    add new language definition, and including it causes the resulting file to be invalid.
    In place of delimiter definition, use @0x + delimiter encoded in hexadecimal.
    The hexadecimal part must be acceptable input to binascii.unhexlify(), otherwise whole 
    directive will be ignored. Use binascii.hexlify('my-delimiter') to generate it.
    Decoded delimiters are not checked for validity (such as, UTF-8) and whether they 
    do not clash with Leo format (like newline or NUL characters)!
    
    Example::
    
        @comment @0x3c212d2d2120 @0x202d2d3e
    
    for GenshiXML is the same definition as 
        
        @comment &lt;!--!_ _--&gt;
    
    to create comments that will be removed from the output by Genshi. But the latter would 
    cause XML parsing error on the @comment line.
    
.. index::
    pair: @delims; Reference

\@delims &lt;1 or 2 comment delims&gt;

    Sets comment delimiters in external files containing sentinel lines.

    The @delims directive requires one or two delimiters, separated by
    whitespace. If one delimiter is present it sets the single-line-comment
    delimiter. If two delimiters are present they set block comment delimiters.

    This directive is often used to place Javascript text inside XML or HTML
    files. Like this::

        @delims /* */
        Javascript stuff
        @delims &lt;-- --&gt;
        HTML stuff

    **Warning**: you **must** change back to previous delimiters using another
    @delims directive. Failure to change back to the previous delimiters will
    thoroughly corrupt the external file as far as compilers, HTML renderers,
    etc. are concerned. Leo does not do this automatically at the end of a node.

    **Warning**: the @comment and @delims directives **must not** appear in
    the same node. Doing so may create a file that Leo can not read.

    **Note**: The @delims directive can not be used to change the comment
    strings at the start of the external file, that is, the comment strings for
    the @+leo sentinel and the initial @+body and @+node sentinels.

.. index::
    pair: @raw; Reference
    pair: @end_raw; Reference

\@raw and \@end_raw

    \@raw starts a section of "raw" text that ends *only* with the @end_raw directive
    or the end of the body text containing the @raw directive. Within this
    range, Leo ignores all section references and directives, and Leo generates
    no additional leading whitespace.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4411">These control how Leo places text when writing external files. They are two of the most important directives in Leo.

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

.. index::
    pair: @all; Reference

\@all

    Copies *all* descendant nodes to the external file. Use @all to place
    unrelated data in an external file.

    The @all directive is valid only in the body of @file trees.

    Within the range of an @all directive, Leo ignores the @others directive
    and section references, so Leo will not complain about orphan nodes.
    
    The @all directivive is designed for "catch-all" files, like
    todo.txt or notes.txt or whatever. Such files are assumed to
    contain a random collection of nodes, so there is no language in
    effect and no real comment delimiters.

.. index::
    pair: @others; Reference

\@others

    Writes the body text of all unnamed descendant into the external file, in
    outline order.

    Whitespace appearing before @others directive adds to the indentation of
    all nodes added by the @others directive.

    A single node may contain only one @others directive, but descendant nodes
    may have other @others directives.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100809122216.4286">Here is a complete list of options for the rst3 and code-to-rst commands:

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

``call_docutils (default: True)``
    Call docutils to process the intermediate file.

``default_path (default: '')``
    The path to be prepended to filenames given in root nodes.

``default_encoding (default: utf-8)``
    The default encoding to be used for non-ascii (unicode characters).

``generate_rst (default: True)``
    A master switch. **True**: generate rST markup for rST sections and rST code-blocks. **False**: generate plain text and ignore ``@ @rst-markup`` doc parts.

``generate_rst_header_comment (default: True)``
    **True**: Leo writes a comment line of the form ``.. rst3: filename: &lt;filename&gt;`` at the start of intermediate files. This option has effect only if the ``generate_rst`` and ``write_intermediate_file`` options are both True.

``publish-argv-for-missing-stylesheets (Default: '')``
    The arguments to be passed to ``docutils.core.Publisher().publish()`` when no stylesheet is in effect. This is a string that represents a comma-separated list of strings: For example, the option::

        publish-argv-for-missing-stylesheets=--language=de,--documentclass=report,--use-latex-toc

    results in the call::

        publish(['--language=de','--documentclass=report','--use-latex-toc'])

``show_headlines (default: True)``
    **True**: automatically generate rST sections from headlines. **False**: ignore headlines.
    
    **Note**: The level of the node in the outline determines the level of the section underlining in the rST markup. Higher-level headlines in the outline correspond to higher-level section headings; lower-level headlines in the outline correspond to lower-level section headings.

``show_organizer_nodes (default: True)``
    **True**: generate rST sections for nodes that do not contain body text. *This option has no effect unless the rST section would otherwise be written*.

``show_sections (default: True)``
    **True**: generate rST sections corresponding to headlines. **False**: Generate lines of the form ``headline`` instead of sections.
    
``silent (default: False)``
    Write only the number of files written and the time taken to the log and console.

``strip_at_file_prefixes (default: True)``
    **True**: remove ``@auto``, ``@file``, ``@clean``, and ``@thin`` from the start of headlines.

``stylesheet_name (default: 'default.css')``
    The name of the stylesheet passed to docutils.

``stylesheet_path (default: '')``
    The directory containing the stylesheet passed to docutils.
    
    **Note**: If the ``stylesheet_embed`` option is True, specify a path relative to the location of the Leo file. If the ``stylesheet_embed`` option is False, specify a path relative to the location of the HTML file.

``stylesheet_embed (default: True)``
    **True**: The content of the stylesheet file will be embedded in the HTML file. **False**: The HTML file will link to an external stylesheet file.

``underline_characters (default: #=+*^~"'\`-:&gt;\_)``
    The underlining characters to be used to specify rST sections. The first character is reserved so you can specify the top-level section explicitly.

``verbose (default: True)``
    **True**: write informational messages to the log as well as the console.

``write_intermediate_file (default: False)``
    Tells whether to write an intermediate file.
    
    **True**: writes the intermediate file to the external file system. The name of the intermediate file has the name of the output file with ``.txt`` appended. This option has effect only if the ``generate_rst option`` is True.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100810091118.4298">**Markup doc parts** have the following form::

    @ @rst-markup
    any rST markup
    @c

Markup doc parts inserts the markup directly into the output. Markup doc parts are most useful when formatting an outline as code using the code-to-rst command.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100810091118.4301">The following options have effect only in code mode.

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

``number_code_lines (default: True)``
    Controls whether to number code lines in code mode. *This option has no effect in rst mode*.

``show_leo_directives (default: True)``
    True: include Leo directives False: ignore Leo directives.

``show_markup_doc_parts (default: False)``
    True: include markup doc parts. False: ignore markup doc parts.

``show_options_doc_parts (default: False)``
    True: include options doc parts. False: ignore options doc parts.

``show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs (default: False)``
    True: Move doc parts outside of the code-block directive. False: Show doc parts in the code-block directive.
    
    **Cool**: Any rST markup in doc parts included as the result of this option will be rendered properly.

``show_options_nodes (default: False)``
    True: show @rst-options nodes. False: Ignore @
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100810091118.4306">The following option has effect only in rst mode.

.. glossary::

``show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode [True,False or class names] (default: True)``
    This option is most useful for rst documents which are not computer code. It allows you to use doc parts to make comments on the draft document which are either excluded from the output or formatted in a way that highlights their nature as comments rather than content. For example, you're writing a book, and you want to use a doc part at the top of a section to remind yourself "need to explain how Ted got to Sally's". Note: you may need to add CSS to have them formatted differently.

    The option can be `True`, `False`, or one or more class names.
    
    **True**: Treat the entire doc part from the opening '@' to the closing '@c
    as normal markup.
    
    **False**: Remove the doc part.

    **class names**: Process the contents of the doc part as it if were in an rst `container` directive. For example::

         @ @rst-options
         show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode = notes literal
         @c

Ths would wrap the doc part contents in the output in a div with classes "container notes literal". Furthermore, if one of the class names is ``literal``, then the doc part content will be output as a literal block wrapped in a container as described above. This allows you to use text which is not valid rst as rough notes for annotating a draft document.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100810203016.4298">The rst3 command supports three different modes.

``rst mode``
    The default mode, as discussed in the Tutorial. The rst3 command treats body text as rST (or Sphinx) markup.
    
``code mode``
    The rst3 command treats body text as computer source code, generating the appropriate rST or Sphinx markup. Code mode is inherently complex. It supports *many* options.
    
``doc-only mode``
    The rst3 command outputs only regular doc parts and @ @rst-markup doc parts. Headlines create section in doc_only mode only if:

1. The node contains a doc part or

2. The show_organizer_nodes option is in effect.

The code_mode and doc_only_mode options determine the mode as follows:

``code_mode=False; doc_only_mode=False (the default)``
    Enters rst mode.
    
``code_mode=False; doc_only_mode=True``
    Enters doc_only mode.

``code_mode=True; (doc_only_mode ignored)``
    Enters code mode.

.. _`Leo's latest sources`: https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor

Leo's core code is always being improved and developed. Unit-testing ensures that the daily commits are as bug-free as possible. Almost all of the time, downloading the most recent `nightly snapshot`_ of the development code is going to give you code that is just as stable and much more up-to-date than the most recent `latest stable release`_ which most Leonistas would consider already outdated.

If you are just checking Leo out, feel free to use the `latest stable release`_ download if it makes you feel more secure, but once you've decided to work with Leo on a regular basis, we highly recommend regularly keeping your installation up to date with the most recent `nightly snapshot`_.

To summarize, you may get Leo in three ways:

1. Download the `latest stable release`_ from `SourceForge`_. This release contains an executable installer. This release will usually be a bit out of date.

2. Download a `nightly snapshot`_ from `Leo's snapshots page`_. This page contains .zip archives of Leo's code from 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 90 days ago.
   
3. Download `Leo's latest sources`_ from `GitHub`_ using `git`_. Installing git is easy, and once set up this is the easiest way to get the latest version of Leo's code::
   
        git clone https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor (http access)
    
   or::
   
        git clone git@github.com:leo-editor/leo-editor.git (ssh access)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100817101952.4306">**Important**: This section tells how to set up git_ so that you can grab
the latest sources using ``git clone``. However, you can get a nightly
snapshot of Leo's git repository (without installing git) from
http://www.greygreen.org/leo/

Many users will want to track the development version of Leo, in order to stay
on top of the latest features and bug fixes. Running the development version is
quite safe and easy, and it's also a requirement if you want to contribute to
Leo.

1. First, you need to get git from http://git-scm.com/.
2. Get Leo from GitHub by doing::

        git clone https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor (http access)
    
   or::
   
        git clone git@github.com:leo-editor/leo-editor.git (ssh access)

And that's it! You can run leo/core/leo.py directly. When you want to refresh the
code with latest modifications from GitHub, run git pull.

Formerly, this had to be on because the expansion bits
of @screenshot trees were significant.

Happily, this is no longer true.

True (recommended):
    Write "E" attribute bits in &lt;v&gt; elements.
    Leo outlines will record the expansion state of all nodes.

False:
    (Good for files like unitTest.leo)
    Suppress "E" attribute bits in &lt;v&gt; elements.
    Only the ancestors of the presently selected node will
    be expanded when Leo opens an outline.

<t tx="ekr.20101025080245.6085">Leo 4.5 final was released September 2, 2008. Leo's drawing and focus code was substantially simplified, removing all calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate.

::

    Full support for @shadow files in Leo's core
    Major improvements to Leo's key binding code &amp; usable vim-like bindings
    uA's may now be associated with vnodes in @thin and @shadow files
    Leo now always uses sax to read .leo files
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101025080245.6086">Leo 4.6 final was released July 15, 2009.  The big feature was caching of external files, a feature suggested by Ville M. Vainio.  Caching *greatly* reduces the time to load .leo files.

::

    Leo used Qt interface by default.
    Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them
    Added @auto-rst and @edit
    Added Properties of commanders, positions and vnodes
    Leo warns on dangerous writes to @thin and @file nodes
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101025080245.6087">Leo 4.7 final was released February 23, 2010. Leo 4.7.1 final fixed a serious bug in Leo 4.7.  It went out the door just days later, on February 26, 2010.

Leo 4.7 accomplishes something I long thought to be impossible: the unification of vnodes and tnodes. tnodes no longer exist: vnodes contain all data. The Aha that made this possible is that iterators and positions allow a single node to appear in more than one place in a tree traversal.

This was one of the most significant developments in Leo's history. At last the endless confusion between vnodes and tnodes is gone. At the most fundamental level, Leo's data structures are as simple as possible. This makes them as general and as powerful as possible!

::

    A single code base runs on both Python 2 and 3
    Automatically converts from old-style to new-style sentinels
    Added a new Windows installer

Leo 4.7.1 fixed dangerous bug in Leo 4.7. The problem arose because it was too easy to save the .leo file (thus deleting the tnodeList) without forcing the converted external files to be saved. The next time Leo attempted to read the external files, the tnodeList would be missing and data would be lost.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101025080245.6089">Leo 4.8 final was released November 26, 2010. This release simplified Leo's sentinels as much as possible. This version also added "Resurrected" and "Recovered" nodes. These nodes protect against data loss, and also implicitly warn when unusual data-changing events occur. Creating this scheme may be the final chapter in the epic saga of error recovery in Leo.

::

    Added Drag and Drop of outlines
    Defined abbreviations in Leo settings nodes
    Leo now uses PyEnchant to check spelling
    Deprecated the ancient Tangle and Untangle commands
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101026082911.5538">The update algorithm guarantees *only* that writing an updated @clean outline will generate the updated **public** file.  **Ambiguous lines** could be placed either at the end of one node or the beginning of the following nodes. The update algorithm *guesses* that such lines should be placed at the end of the previous node.

Happily, guesses are not serious. Once you move an ambiguous node and save the Leo file, the update algorithm will not have to guess where the line belongs the next time Leo reads the @clean files.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9400">Edits user attributes in a Qt frame.

This plugin creates a frame for editing attributes similar to::

    Name:   Fred Blogs
    Home:   555-555-5555
    Work:   555-555-5556

``attrib_edit`` is also intended to provide attribute editing for other plugins, see below.

The attributes can be stored in different ways, three modes are implemented currently:

v.u mode
  These attributes are stored in the "unknownAttributes" (uA) data for
  each node, accessed via v.u.

Field:
  Attributes are lines starting (no whitespace) with "AttributeName:" in
  the body text.

@Child
  Attributes are the head strings of child nodes when the head string
  starts with '@AttributeName' where the first letter (second character)
  must be capitalized.

The plugin defines the following commands, available either in the plugin's sub-menu in the Plugins menu, or as ``Alt-X attrib-edit-*``.

attrib-edit-modes
    Select which attribute setting / getting modes to use.  More than one mode
    can be used at the same time.

    You can also control which modes are active by listing them 
    with the @data attrib_edit_active_modes setting.  For example::

        Field:
        @Child
        # v.u mode

    would cause only the "Field:" and "@Child" modes to be active be default.

attrib-edit-manage
    Select which attributes, from all attributes seen so
    far in this outline, to include on the current node.

attrib-edit-scan
    Scan the entire outline for attributes so ``attrib-edit-manage``
    has the complete list.

attrib-edit-create
    Create a new attribute on the current node.  If Field: or @Child modes
    are active, they simply remind you how to create an attribute in the log pane.
    If the "v.u mode" mode is active, you're prompted for a path for the attribute.
    For example::

        addressbook First

    to store the attribute in v.u['addressbook']['_edit']['First']

    As a convenience, entering a path like::

        todo metadata created|creator|revised

    would create::

        v.u.['todo']['metadata']['_edit']['created']
        v.u.['todo']['metadata']['_edit']['creator']
        v.u.['todo']['metadata']['_edit']['revised']


**Technical details**

See the source for complete documentation for use with other plugins. Here are some points of interest:

- In addition to ``v.u['addressbook']['_edit']['first']``, paths like ``v.u['addressbook']['_edit']['_int']['age']`` may be used to identify type, although currently there's no difference in the edit widget.

- In the future the plugin may allow other plugins to register to provide attribute path information, instead of just scanning for ['_edit'] entries in v.u.

- Currently there's no sorting of the attributes in "v.u mode", which is a problem for some applications.  It's unclear where the desired order would be stored, without even more repetition in v.u.  When other plugins can register to manipulate the attribute list each plugin could address this, with unordered presentation in the absence of the client plugin.

- There's code to have the editor appear in a tab instead of its own area under the body editor, but (a) this is always being buried by output in the log window, and (b) there's a bug which leaves some (harmless) ghost widgets in the background.  Enable by @setting ``attrib_edit_placement`` to 'tab'.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9401">Manipulates appearance of individual tree widget items.

This plugin is mostly an example of how to change the appearance of headlines. As such, it does a relatively mundane chore of highlighting @thin, @auto, @shadow nodes in bold.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9402">Defines various useful actions for context menus (Qt only).

Examples are:

- Edit in $EDITOR
- Edit @thin node in $EDITOR (remember to do "refresh" after this!)
- Refresh @thin node from disk (e.g. after editing it in external editor)
- Go to clone

Here's an example on how to implement your own context menu items in your plugins::

    def nextclone_rclick(c,p, menu):
        """ Go to next clone """

        # only show the item if you are on a clone
        # this is what makes this "context sensitive"
        if not p.isCloned():
            return    

        def nextclone_rclick_cb():
            c.goToNextClone()

        # 'menu' is a QMenu instance that was created by Leo 
        # in response to right click on tree item

        action = menu.addAction("Go to clone")
        action.connect(action, QtCore.SIGNAL("triggered()"), nextclone_rclick_cb)

And call this in your plugin *once*::

    g.tree_popup_handlers.append(nextclone_rclick)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9403">Adds "Back" and "Forward" buttons (Qt only).

Creates "back" and "forward" buttons on button bar. These navigate
the node history.

This plugin does not need specific setup. If the plugin is loaded, the buttons 
will be available. The buttons use the icon specified in the active Qt style

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9404">Creates a wizard that creates @auto nodes.

Opens a file dialog and recursively creates @auto &amp; @path nodes from the path
where the selected file is (the selected file itself doesn't matter.)

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9405">Adds a fast-to-use search widget, like the "Find in files" feature of many editors.

Just load the plugin, activate "Nav" tab, enter search text and press enter.

The pattern to search for is, by default, a case *insensitive* fnmatch pattern
(e.g. foo*bar), because they are typically easier to type than regexps. If you
want to search for a regexp, use 'r:' prefix, e.g. r:foo.*bar.

Regexp matching is case sensitive; if you want to do a case-insensitive regular
expression search (or any kind of case-sensitive search in the first place), do it
by searching for "r:(?i)Foo". (?i) is a standard feature of Python regular expression
syntax, as documented in 

http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9406">Provides a Scrolled Message Dialog service for Qt.

The plugin can display messages supplied as plain text or formatted as html. In
addition the plugin can accept messages in rst format and convert them to be
displayed as html.

The displayed format can be controlled by the user via check boxes, so rst
messages may be viewed either as text or as html. Html messages can also be
viewed as raw text, which will be a good debug feature when creating complex
dynamically generated html messages.

The user interface is provided by a ScrolledMessage.ui file which is dynamically
loaded each time a new dialog is loaded.

The dialog is not modal and many dialogs can exist at one time. Dialogs can be
named and output directed to a dialog with a specific name.

The plugin is invoked like this::

    g.doHook('scrolledMessage', c=c, msg='message', title='title',  ...etc    )

or::

    g.app.gui.runScrolledMessageDialog(c=c, ...etc)

All parameters are optional except c.

**Parameters**

msg:
    The text to be displayed (html, rst, plain).

    If the text starts with 'rst:' it is assumed to be rst text and
    is converted to html for display after the rst: prefix has been removed.
    If the text starts with '&lt;' it is assumed to be html.
    These auto detection features can be overridden by 'flags'.

label:
    The text to appear in a label above the display. If it is '', the label is hidden.

title:
    The title to appear on the window or dock.

flags:
    Says what kind of message: 'rst', 'text', 'html'. This overrides auto-detection.

    Flags can be combined, for example, 'rst html' causes the message
    to be interpreted as rst and displayed as html.

..  To Do
..  - Add parameters to control position, size, closing, hiding etc.
..  - Save or print files from the dialog.
..  - Add an option to put the dialog in leo's log notebook.
..  - Add @settings to control default behavior
..  - Provide a menu of plugins that allows their docstring to be displayed.
..  - Provide a menu of @rst nodes in the current outline, automatically track changes
..    if it is set to display any of these nodes.

See http://packages.python.org/spyder/

Execute alt-x spyder-launch to start spyder. Execute alt-x spyder-update to pass
current c,p,g to spyder interactive session. spyder-update also shows the window

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9408">Adds simple "sticky notes" feature (popout editors) for Qt gui.

Adds the following (``Alt-X``) commands:

``stickynote``
  pop out current node as a sticky note
``stickynoter``
  pop out current node as a rich text note
``stickynoteenc``
  pop out current node as an encrypted note
``stickynoteenckey``
  enter a new en/decryption key
``tabula``
  add the current node to the stickynotes in the `Tabula`
  sticky note dock window, and show the window
``tabula-show``
  show the`Tabula` sticky note dock window
  (without adding the current node)
``tabula-marked``
  add all marked nodes to the stickynotes in the `Tabula`
  sticky note dock window, and show the window

Sticky notes are synchronized (both ways) with their parent Leo node.

Encrypted mode requires the python-crypto module.

The first time you open a note in encrypted mode you'll be asked for a pass
phrase. That phrase will be used for the rest of the session, you can change it
with ``Alt-X`` ``stickynoteenckey``, but probably won't need to.

The encrypted note is stored in base64 encoded *encrypted* text in the parent
Leo node, if you forget the pass phrase there's no way to un-encrypt it again.
Also, you must not edit the text in the Leo node.

When **creating an encrypted note**, you should **start with an empty node**.
If you want to encrypt text that already exists in a node, select-all cut it to
empty the node, then paste it into the note.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9409">Provides to-do list and simple task management for leo (Qt only).

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9410">Creates a window for *live* rendering of rst, html, etc.  Qt only.
Supports @graphics-script, @image, @html, @movie and @svg nodes.

viewrendered.py creates a single ``Alt-X`` style command, ``viewrendered``,
which opens a new window where the current body text is rendered as HTML
(if it starts with '&lt;'), or otherwise reStructuredText.  reStructuredText
errors and warnings may be shown.  For example, both::

    Heading
    -------

    `This` is **really** a line of text.

and::

    &lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;h1&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;This&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; a line of text.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9416">Allows the user to import Cisco configuration files.

Adds the "File:Import:Import Cisco Configuration" menu item. The plugin will:

1)  Create a new node, under the current node, where the configuration will be written. This node will typically have references to several sections (see below).

2)  Create sections (child nodes) for the indented blocks present in the original config file. These child nodes will have sub-nodes grouping similar blocks (e.g. there will be an 'interface' child node, with as many sub-nodes as there are real interfaces in the configuration file).

3)  Create sections for the custom keywords specified in the customBlocks[] list in importCiscoConfig(). You can modify this list to specify different keywords. DO NOT put keywords that are followed by indented blocks (these are taken care of by point 2 above). The negated form of the keywords (for example, if the keyword is 'service', the negated form is 'no service') is also included in the sections.

4)  Not display consecutive empty comment lines (lines with only a '!').

All created sections are alphabetically ordered.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9417">Modifies the Python @auto importer so that the importer puts the __init__ method (ctor) into the body of the class node.

This makes it easier to keep the instance variable docs in the class docstring in sync. with the ivars as manipulated by __init__, saves repeating explanations in both places.

Note that this is done *after* the consistency checks by the @auto import code, so using this plugin is at your own risk.  It will change the order of declarations if other methods are declared before __init__.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9420">Creates new nodes containing parameterized section reference.

This plugin adds nodes under the currently selected tree that are to act as section references. To do so, go the Outline menu and select the 'Parameterize Section Reference' command. This plugin looks for a top level node called 'Parameterized Nodes'. If it finds a headline that matches the section reference it adds a node/nodes to the current tree.

To see this in action, do the following:

0. **Important**: in the examples below, type &lt;&lt; instead of &lt; &lt; and
   type &gt;&gt; instead of &gt; &gt;.  Docstrings can not contain section references!

1. Create a node called 'Parameterized Nodes', with a sub-node called  &lt; &lt; Meow \&gt;\&gt;.
   The body of &lt; &lt; Meow &gt; &gt; should have the text::

        I mmmm sooo happy I could  &lt; &lt; 1$  &gt; &gt;.
        But I don't know if I have all the  &lt; &lt; 2$  &gt; &gt;
        money in the world.

2. In a node called A, type::

        &lt; &lt; meow( purrrrrr, zzooot )  &gt; &gt;
        (leave the cursor at the end of the line)

3. In a node called B, type::

         &lt; &lt; meow ( spit or puke, blinking  )  &gt; &gt;
        (leave the cursor at the end of the line)

4. Leave the cursor in Node A at the designated point.

5. Go to Outline and select Parameterize Section Reference.

The plugin searches the outline, goes to level one and finds a Node with the Headline, "Parameterized Nodes". It looks for nodes under that headline with the the headline &lt;\&lt; meow &gt;\&gt;. It then creates this node structure under Node A::

        &lt; &lt; meow ( purrrrrr, zzooot ) &gt; &gt;
            &lt; &lt;2$&gt; &gt;
            &lt; &lt;1$&gt; &gt;

6. Examine the new subnodes of Node A:  

        &lt; &lt; meow ( purrrrrr, zzooot ) &gt; &gt; contains the body text of the &lt; &lt; meow &gt; &gt; node.
        &lt; &lt; 1$ &gt; &gt; contains the word purrrrrr.
        &lt; &lt; 2$ &gt; &gt; contains the word zzooot.

7. Go to Node B, and leave the cursor at the designated point.

Go to Outline Menu and select Parameterize Section Reference command.

8. Examine the new subnodes of Node B.

It's a lot easier to use than to explain!

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9428">Creates buttons to move nodes quickly to other nodes.

Quickly move/copy/clone nodes from around the tree to one or more target nodes. It can also create bookmark and tagging functionality in an outline (see `Set Parent Notes` below).

Adds `Move/Clone/Copy To Last Child Button` and `Move/Clone/Copy To First Child Button`, `Link To/From` and `Jump To` commands to the Move sub-menu on the Outline menu, and each node's context menu, if the `contextmenu` plugin is enabled.

Select a node ``Foo`` and then use the `Move To Last Child Button` command. This adds a 'to Foo' button to the button bar. Now select another node and click the 'to Foo' button. The selected node will be moved to the last child of the node 'Foo'.

`To First Child Button` works the same way, except that moved nodes are inserted as the first child of the target node.

`Clone` and `Copy` variants are like `Move`, but clone or copy instead of moving.

`Link` works in conjunction with the `backlink` plugin (and also the `graphcanvas` plugin) creating a link to/from the target and current nodes.

`Jump` buttons act as bookmarks, taking you to the target node.

You can right click on any of these buttons to access their context menu:

  Goto Target
    takes you to the target node (like a `Jump` button).
  Make Permanent
    makes the button permanent, it will reappear
    when the file is saved / closed / re-opened.
  Set Parent
    allows you to move buttons to sub-menu items of other
    `quickMove` buttons.  This implicitly makes the moved button
    permanent.  It also causes the moved button to lose its context menu.
  Remove Button
    comes from the `mod_scripting` plugin, and just
    removes the button for the rest of the current session.

Set Parent Notes
  `Set Parent` doesn't allow you to do anything with `quickMove` you couldn't
  do with a long strip of separate buttons, but it collects quickMove buttons
  as sub-menu items of one quickMove button, saving a lot of toolbar space.

Bookmarks 
  Create somewhere out of the way in your outline a node called
  `Bookmarks`. Use the quickMove menu to make it a `Jump To` button, and use its
  context menu to make it permanent. There is no particular reason to jump to
  it, but it needs to be a `quickMove` button of some kind.

  Now, when you want to bookmark a node, first use the quickMove menu to make
  the node a `Jump To` button, and then use the context menu on the button to
  set its parent to your `Bookmarks` button.  It becomes a sub-menu item
  of the `Bookmarks` button.

Tags
  In conjunction with the `backlinks` plugin you can use `quickMove` to
  tag nodes.   The `backlinks` plugin adds a `Links` tab to the `Log pane`.

  Create somewhere in your outline a node called `Tags`. Use the quickMove menu
  to make it a `Jump To` button, and use its context menu to make it permanent.
  Clicking on it will jump you to your tag list. Now create a node under the
  `Tags` node for each tag you want. The node's name will be the tag name, and
  can be changed later. Then use the quickMove menu to make each of these nodes
  a `Link To` button, and then use the context menu on the button to set its
  parent to your `Tags` button. It becomes a sub-menu item of the `Tags` button.

  To see the tags on a node, you need to be looking at the `Links` tab in the
  `Log pane`.  To see all the nodes with a particular tag, click on the `Tags`
  button to jump to the tag list, and select the node which names the tag of
  interest.  The nodes with that tag will be listed in th `Links` tab in the
  `Log pane`.

It's recommended that you have gvim installed--the basic console vim is not recommended.

When properly installed, this plugin does the following:

- By default, the plugin opens nodes on icondclick2 events.
  (double click in the icon box)

- The setting::

    @string vim_trigger_event = icondclick2

  controls when nodes are opened in vim.  The default, shown above,
  opens a node in vim on double clicks in Leo's icon box.
  A typical alternative would be::

      @string vim_trigger_event = iconclick2

  to open nodes on single clicks in the icon box.
  You could also set:

      @string vim_trigger_event = select2

  to open a node in vim whenever the selected node changes for any reason.

- Leo will put Vim cursor at same location as Leo cursor in file if 'vim_plugin_positions_cursor' set to True.

- Leo will put node in a Vim tab card if 'vim_plugin_uses_tab_feature' set to True.

- Leo will update the node in the outline when you save the file in VIM.

To install this plugin do the following:

1. On Windows, set the vim_cmd and vim_exe settings to the path to vim or gvim as shown in leoSettings.leo. Alternatively, you can ensure that gvim.exe is on your PATH.

1. If you are using Python 2.4 or above, that's all you need to do. Jim Sizelove's new code will start vim automatically using Python's subprocess module. The subprocess module comes standard with Python 2.4. For Linux systems, Leo will use subprocess.py in Leo's extensions folder if necessary.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9448">Synchronizes @path nodes with folders.

If a node is named '@path path_to_folder', the content (file and folder names) of the folder and the children of that node will synchronized whenever the node's status-iconbox is double clicked.

For files not previously seen in a folder a new node will appear on top of the children list (with a mark).

Folders appear in the list as /foldername/. If you double click on the icon-box of the folder node, it will have children added to it based on the contents of the folder on disk. These folders have the '@path' directive as the first line of their body text.

When files are deleted from the folder and the list is updated by double clicking the files will appear in the list as *filename* (or */foldername/*).

You can describe files and directories in the body of the nodes.

You can organize files and directories with organizer nodes, an organizer node name cannot contain with '/'.

Files and folders can be created by entering a node with the required name as its headline (must start and/or end with "/" for a folder) and then double clicking on the node's status-iconbox.

\@auto nodes can be set up for existing files can be loaded by double clicking on the node's status-iconbox. If you prefer @shadow or something else use the "active_path_attype" setting, without the "@".

There are commands on the Plugins active_path submenu:

- show path - show the current path
- set absolute path - changes a node "/dirname/" to "@path /absolute/path/to/dirname".
- purge vanished (recursive) - remove *entries*
- update recursive - recursive load of directories, use with caution on large
  file systems

If you want to use an input other than double clicking a node's status-iconbox set active_path_event to a value like 'iconrclick1' or 'iconclick1'.

There are @settings for ignoring directory entries and automatically loading files.  ``re.search`` is used, rather than ``re.match``, so patterns need only match part of the filename, not the whole filename.

The body of the @setting ``@data active_path_ignore`` is a list of regex patterns, one per line.  Directory entries matching any pattern in the list will be ignored.  The names of directories used for matching will have forward slashes around them ('/dirname/'), so patterns can use this to distinguish between directories and files.

The body of the @setting ``@data active_path_autoload`` is a list of regex patterns, one per line.  File entries matching any pattern in the list will be loaded automatically.  This works only with files, not directories (but you can load directories recursively anyway).

Set ``@bool active_path_load_docstring = True`` to have active_path load the docstring of .py files automatically.  These nodes start with the special string::

    @language rest # AUTOLOADED DOCSTRING

which must be left intact if you want active path to be able to double-click load the file later.

\@float active_path_timeout_seconds (default 10.) controls the maximum time active_path will spend on a recursive operation.

\@int active_path_max_size (default 1000000) controls the maximum size file active_path will open without query.

active_path is a rewrite of the at_directory plugin to use @path directives (which influence @auto and other @file type directives), and to handle sub-folders more automatically.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9449">Synchronizes @folder nodes with folders.

If a node is named '@folder path_to_folder', the content (filenames) of the folder and the children of that node will be sync. Whenever a new file is put there, a new node will appear on top of the children list (with mark). So that I can put my description (i.e. annotation) as the content of that node. In this way, I can find any files much easier from leo.

Moreover, I add another feature to allow you to group files(in leo) into children of another group. This will help when there are many files in that folder. You can logically group it in leo (or even clone it to many groups), while keep every files in a flat/single directory on your computer.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9450">Executes commands in nodes whose body text starts with @produce.

WARNING: trying to execute a non-existent command will hang Leo.

To use, put in the body text of a node::

    @produce echo hi
    
This plugin creates two new commands: at-produce-all and at-produce-selected.

at-produce-all scans the entire tree for body text containing @produce. at-produce-selected just scans the selected tree.

Whatever follows @produce is executed as a command.

@produce commands are executed in the order they are found, that is, in outline order.

The at-produce commands produce a log node as the last top-level node of the outline. Any output, including error messages, should be there.

This plugin is not intended as a replacement for make or Ant, but as a simple substitute when that machinery is overkill.

There are options to omit Saturdays and Sundays.

An 'Insert Date Nodes ...' submenu will be created (by default) in the 'Outline' menu.  This menu can be suppressed by using either of the following settings::

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9454">Adds @expfolder nodes that represent folders in the file system.

Double clicking on the icon of an @expfolder heading reads the files in the directory at the path specified and creates child nodes for each file in the subfolder. Subdirectories are made into child @expfolder nodes so the tree can be easily traversed. If files have extensions specified in the expfolder.ini file they are made into @text nodes so the content of the files can be easily loaded into leo and edited. Double clicking a second time will delete all child nodes and refresh the directory listing. If there are any changed @text nodes contained inside you will be prompted about saving them.

The textextensions field on the expfolder Properties page contains a list of extensions which will be made into @text nodes, separated by spaces.

For the @text and @expfolder nodes to interact correctly, the textnode plugin must load before the expfolder plugin. This can be set using the Plugin Manager's Plugin Load Order pane.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9455">Defines actions taken when double-clicking on @&lt;file&gt; nodes and supports @file-ref nodes.

Double-clicking any kind of @&lt;file&gt; node writes out the file if changes have been made since the last save, and then runs a script on it, which is retrieved from the outline.

Scripts are located in a node whose headline is FileActions. This node can be anywhere in the outline. If there is more than one such node, the first one in outline order is used.

The children of that node are expected to contain a file pattern in the headline and the script to be executed in the body. The file name is matched against the patterns (which are Unix-style shell patterns), and the first matching node is selected. If the filename is a path, only the last item is matched.

Execution of the scripts is similar to the "Execute Script" command in Leo. The main difference is that the namespace in which the scripts are run contains these elements:

- 'c' and 'g' and 'p': as in the regular execute script command.

- 'filename': the filename from the @file directive.

- 'shellScriptInWindow', a utility function that runs a shell script in an external windows, thus permitting programs to be called that require user interaction

File actions are implemented for all kinds @&lt;file&gt; nodes. There is also a new node type @file-ref for referring to files purely for the purpose of file actions, Leo does not do anything with or to such files.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9458">Opens files with their default platform program.

Double-clicking @mime nodes will attempt to open the named file as if opened from a file manager. @path parent nodes are used to find the full filename path.  Fore example::

    @mime foodir/document.pdf

The string setting 'mime_open_cmd' allows specifying a program to handle opening files::

    @settings
        @string mime_open_cmd = see
        .. or ..
        @string mime_open_cmd = see %s

Where '%s' is replaced with the full pathname.

**Note**: This plugin terminates handling of the 'icondclick1' event by returning True. If another plugin using this event (e.g. vim.py) is also enabled, the order in @enabled-plugins matters. For example: if vim.py is enabled before mime.py, double-clicking on an @mime node will both open the body text in [g]vim AND call the mime_open_cmd.

This plugin is complementary to the UNL.py plugin's @url nodes. Use @url for opening either URLs or Uniform Node Locators in "\*.leo" files and use @mime nodes for opening files on the local file system. It also replaces the startfile.py plugin, where here the headline must start with @mime to activate this plugin.

For other sys.platform's, add an elif case to the section "guess file association handler" and either define a default _mime_open_cmd string, where "%s" will be replaced with the filename, or define a function taking the filename string as its only argument and set as open_func.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9459">Allows Leo to write a file to multiple locations.

This plugin acts as a post-write mechanism, a file must be written to the file system for it to work. At this point it is not a replacement for @path or an absolute path, it works in tandem with them.

To use, place @multipath at the start of a line in the root node or an ancestor of the node. The format is (On Unix-like systems)::

    @multipath /machine/unit/:/machine/robot/:/machine/

New in version 0.6 of this plugin: the separator used above is ';' not ':', for example::

    @multipath c:\prog\test;c:\prog\unittest

It will places copy of the written file in each of these directories.

There is an additional directive that simplifies common paths, it is called
@multiprefix. By typing @multiprefix with a path following it, before a
@multipath directive you set the beginning of the paths in the @multipath
directive. For example::

    #@multiprefix /leo #@multipath /plugins 

or::

    #@multiprefix /leo/
    #@multipath plugins: fungus : drain

copies a file to /leo/plugins /leo/fungus /leo/drain.

**Note**: I put # in front of the directives here because I don't want someone browsing this file to accidentally save multiple copies of this file to their system! 

The @multiprefix stays in effect for the entire tree until reset with another
@multiprefix directive. @multipath is cumulative, in that for each @multipath in
an ancestor a copy of the file is created. These directives must at the beginning of the line and by themselves.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9461">Creates and updates @read-only nodes.

Here's my first attempt at customizing leo. I wanted to have the ability to import files in "read-only" mode, that is, in a mode where files could only be read by leo (not tangled), and also kept in sync with the content on the drive.

The reason for this is for example that I have external programs that generate resource files. I want these files to be part of a leo outline, but I don't want leo to tangle or in any way modify them. At the same time, I want them to be up-to-date in the leo outline.

So I coded the directive plugin. It has the following characteristics:

- It reads the specified file and puts it into the node content.

- If the @read-only directive was in the leo outline already, and the file content on disk has changed from what is stored in the outline, it marks the node as changed and prints a "changed" message to the log window; if, on the other hand, the file content has _not_ changed, the file is simply read and the node is not marked as changed.

- When you write a @read-only directive, the file content is added to the node immediately, i.e. as soon as you press Enter (no need to call a menu entry to import the content).

- If you want to refresh/update the content of the file, just edit the headline and press Enter. The file is reloaded, and if in the meantime it has changed, a "change" message is sent to the log window.

- The body text of a @read-only file cannot be modified in leo.

The syntax to access files in @read-only via ftp/http is the following::

    @read-only http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0791.txt
    @read-only ftp://ftp.someserver.org/filepath

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9462">Runs a program and interface Leos through its input/output/error streams.

Double clicking the icon box whose headlines are @run 'cmd args' will execute the command. There are several other features, including @arg and @input nodes.

The run_nodes.py plugin introduce two new nodes that transform leo into a terminal. It was mostly intended to run compilers and debuggers while having the possibility to send messages to the program.

Double clicking on the icon of an node whose headline is @run &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt; will launch &lt;command&gt; with the given arguments. It will also mark the node. # Terminates the argument list. @run # &lt;comment&gt; is also valid.

@in nodes are used to send input to the running process. Double clicking on
the icon of an @in &lt;message&gt; node will append a "\n" to &lt;message&gt; and write it to the program, no matter where the node is placed. If no @run node is active, nothing happens.

The body text of every child, in which the headlines do not begin with '@run' or '@in', will be appended to &lt;command&gt;, allowing you to add an unlimited number of arguments to &lt;command&gt;.

The output of the program is written in the log pane (Error output in red). When the program exit the node is set unmarked and the return value is displayed... When the enter key is pressed in the body pane of an active @run node the content of it body pane is written to the program and then emptied ready for another line of input. If the node have @run nodes in its descendants, they will be launched successively. (Unless one returned an exit code other than 0, then it will stop there)

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9463">Support slideshows in Leo outlines.

This plugin defines four new commands:

- next-slide-show:  move to the start of the next slide show,
  or the first slide show if no slide show has been seen yet.
- prev-slide-show:  move to the start of the previous slide show,
  or the first slide show if no slide show has been seen yet.
- next-slide: move to the next slide of a present slide show.
- prev-slide: move to the previous slide of the present slide show.

Slides shows consist of a root @slideshow node with descendant @slide nodes. @slide nodes may be organized via non-@slide nodes that do not appear in the slideshow.

All these commands ignore @ignore trees.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9468">Allows interaction with shell apps via screen.

Analysis environments like SQL, R, scipy, ipython, etc. can be used by pasting sections of text from an editor (Leo) and a shell window.  Results can be pasted back into the editor.

This plugin streamlines the process by communicating with ``screen``, the shell multiplexer

**Commands**

leoscreen-run-text
  Send the text selected in Leo's body text to the shell app.
  Selects the next line for your convenience.

leoscreen-get-line
  Insert a line of the last result from the shell into Leo's body text
  at the current insert point.  Lines are pulled one at a time starting
  from the end of the output.  Can be used repeatedly to get the
  output you want into Leo.

leoscreen-get-all
  Insert all of the last result from the shell into Leo's body text
  at the current insert point.

leoscreen-get-note
  Insert all of the last result from the shell into a new child node of
  the current node.

leoscreen-show-all
  Show the output from the last result from the shell in a temporary
  read only window. **Important**: The output is not stored.

leoscreen-show-note
  Insert all of the last result from the shell into a new child node of
  the current node and display that node a a stickynote (requires stickynote
  plugin).

leoscreen-next
  Switch screen session to next window.

leoscreen-prev
  Switch screen session to preceding window.

leoscreen-other
  Switch screen session to last window displayed.

leoscreen-get-prefix
  Interactively get prefix for inserting text into body (#, --, //, etc/)
  Can also set using::

      c.leo_screen.get_line_prefix = '#'

leoscreen-more-prompt
  Skip one less line at the end of output when fetching output into Leo.
  Adjusts lines skipped to avoid pulling in the applications prompt line.

leoscreen-less-prompt
  Skip one more line at the end of output when fetching output into Leo
  Adjusts lines skipped to avoid pulling in the applications prompt line.

**Settings**

leoscreen_prefix
  Prepended to output pulled in to Leo. The substring SPACE in this
  setting will be replaced with a space character, to allow for trailing
  spaces.

leoscreen_time_fmt
  time.strftime format for note type output headings.

**Theory of operation**

leoscreen creates a instance at c.leo_screen which has some methods which might
be useful in ``@button`` and other Leo contexts.

**Example SQL setup**

In a Leo file full of interactive SQL analysis, I have::

    @settings
        @string leoscreen_prefix = --SPACE
    @button rollback
        import time
        c.leo_screen.run_text('ROLLBACK;  -- %s\n' % time.asctime())
    @button commit
        import time
        cmd = 'COMMIT;  -- %s' % time.asctime()
        c.leo_screen.run_text(cmd)
        c.leo_screen.insert_line(cmd)

which creates a button to rollback messed up queries, another to commit (requiring additional action to supply the newline as a safeguard) and sets the prefix to "-- " for text pulled back from the SQL session into Leo.

**Implementation note**: screen behaves differently if screen -X is executed with the same stdout as the target screen, vs. a different stdout. Although stdout is ignored, Popen() needs to ensure it's not just inherited.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9469">Creates script buttons and @button, @command, @plugin and @script nodes.

This plugin puts buttons in the icon area. Depending on settings the plugin will create the 'Run Script', the 'Script Button' and the 'Debug Script' buttons.

The 'Run Script' button is simply another way of doing the Execute Script command: it executes the selected text of the presently selected node, or the entire text if no text is selected.

The 'Script Button' button creates *another* button in the icon area every time you push it. The name of the button is the headline of the presently selected node. Hitting this *newly created* button executes the button's script.

For example, to run a script on any part of an outline do the following:

1.  Select the node containing the script.
2.  Press the scriptButton button.  This will create a new button.
3.  Select the node on which you want to run the script.
4.  Push the *new* button.

That's all.

For every @button node, this plugin creates two new minibuffer commands: x and delete-x-button, where x is the 'cleaned' name of the button. The 'x' command is equivalent to pushing the script button.

You can specify **global buttons** in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo by putting @button nodes as children of an @buttons node in an @settings trees. Such buttons are included in all open .leo (in a slightly different color). Actually, you can specify global buttons in any .leo file, but @buttons nodes affect all later opened .leo files so usually you would define global buttons in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo.

The cleaned name of an @button node is the headline text of the button with:

- Leading @button or @command removed,
- @key and all following text removed,
- @args and all following text removed,
- all non-alphanumeric characters converted to a single '-' characters.

Thus, cleaning headline text converts it to a valid minibuffer command name.

You can delete a script button by right-clicking on it, or by executing the delete-x-button command.

The 'Debug Script' button runs a script using an external debugger.

This plugin optionally scans for @button nodes, @command, @plugin nodes and
@script nodes whenever a .leo file is opened.

- @button nodes create script buttons.
- @command nodes create minibuffer commands.
- @plugin nodes cause plugins to be loaded.
- @script nodes cause a script to be executed when opening a .leo file.

Such nodes may be security risks. This plugin scans for such nodes only if the corresponding atButtonNodes, atPluginNodes, and atScriptNodes constants are set to True in this plugin.

You can specify the following options in leoSettings.leo.  See the node:
@settings--&gt;Plugins--&gt;scripting plugin.  Recommended defaults are shown::

    @bool scripting-at-button-nodes = True
    True: adds a button for every @button node.

    @bool scripting-at-commands-nodes = True
    True: define a minibuffer command for every @command node.

    @bool scripting-at-plugin-nodes = False
    True: dynamically loads plugins in @plugins nodes when a window is created.

    @bool scripting-at-script-nodes = False
    True: dynamically executes script in @script nodes when a window is created.
    This is dangerous!

    @bool scripting-create-debug-button = False
    True: create Debug Script button.

    @bool scripting-create-run-script-button = False
    True: create Run Script button.
    Note: The plugin creates the press-run-script-button regardless of this setting.

    @bool scripting-create-script-button-button = True
    True: create Script Button button in icon area.
    Note: The plugin creates the press-script-button-button
          regardless of this setting.

    @int scripting-max-button-size = 18
    The maximum length of button names: longer names are truncated.

You can bind key shortcuts to @button and @command nodes as follows.

@button name @key=shortcut

    Binds the shortcut to the script in the script button. The button's name is
    'name', but you can see the full headline in the status line when you move the
    mouse over the button.

@command name @key=shortcut

    Creates a new minibuffer command and binds shortcut to it. As with @buffer
    nodes, the name of the command is the cleaned name of the headline.

This plugin is based on ideas from e's dynabutton plugin, quite possibly the most brilliant idea in Leo's history.

You can run the script with sys.argv initialized to string values using @args. For example::

    @button test-args @args = a,b,c

will set sys.argv to [u'a',u'b',u'c']

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9475">Creates stand-alone slideshows containing screenshots.

This plugin defines five commands. The **apropos-slides** command prints this message to Leo's log pane. The **slide-show-info** command prints the settings in effect.

The **make-slide** and **make-slide-show** commands, collectively called **slide commands**, create collections of slides from **@slideshow** trees containing **@slide** nodes.

Slides may link to screenshots. The slide commands can generate screenshots from **@screenshot-tree** nodes, but this feature has proven to be clumsy and inflexible. It is usually more convenient to use screenshots taken with a program such as Wink. The **meld-slides** command creates references to externally-generated screenshots within @slide nodes.

\@slide nodes may contain **@url nodes**. These @url nodes serve two purposes. First, they allow you to see various files (slides, initial screenshots, working files and final screenshots). Second, these @url nodes guide the meld script and the four commands defined by this plugin (see below). By inserting or deleting these @url nodes you (or your scripts) can customize how the commands (and meld) work. In effect, the @url nodes become per-slide settings.

**Prerequisites**

Inkscape (Required)
  An SVG editor: http://www.inkscape.org/
  Allows the user to edit screenshots.
  Required to create final output (PNG) files.

PIL (Optional but highly recommended)
  The Python Imaging Library,
  http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Wink (Optional)
  A program that creates slideshows and slides.
  http://www.debugmode.com/wink/

**Summary**

@slideshow &lt;slideshow-name&gt;
  Creates the folder:
  &lt;sphinx_path&gt;/slides/&lt;slideshow-name&gt;

@slide &lt;ignored text&gt;
  Creates slide-&lt;slide-number&gt;.html
  (in the sphinx _build directory).
  **Note**: the plugin skips any @slide nodes
  with empty body text.

@screenshot
  Specifies the contents of the screenshot.

**Options** are child nodes of @slideshow or @slide nodes that control the make-slide and make-slide-show commands. See the Options section below.

The make-slide and make-slide-show commands create the following @url nodes as children of each @slide node:

@url built slide
  Contains the absolute path to the final slide in
  the _build/html subfolder of the slideshow
  folder. If present, this @url node completely
  disables rebuilding the slide.

@url screenshot
  Contains the absolute path to the original
  screenshot file. If present, this @url node
  inhibits taking the screenshot.

@url working file
  Contains the absolute path to the working file.
  If present, this @url node disables taking the
  screenshot, creating the working file. The final
  output file will be regenerated if the working
  file is newer than the final output file.

@url final output file
  Contains the absolute path to the final output
  file.

Thus, to completely recreate an @slide node, you must delete any of the following nodes that appear as its children::

    @url screenshot
    @url working file
    @url built slide

**Making slides**

For each slide, the make-slide and make-slide-show commands do the following:

1. Create a slide.

  If the @slide node contains an @screenshot tree,
  the plugin appends an ``.. image::`` directive
  referring to the screenshot to the body text of
  the @slide node. The plugin also creates a child
  @image node referring to the screenshot.

2. (Optional) Create a screenshot.

  The plugin creates a screenshot for an @slide
  node only if the @slide node contains an
  @screenshot node as a direct child.

  **Important**: this step has largely been
  superseded by the ``@button meld`` script in
  LeoDocs.leo.

  Taking a screenshot involves the following steps:

  A. Create the **target outline**: screenshot-setup.leo.

    The target outline contains consists of all
    the children (and their descendants) of the
    @screenshot node.

  B. Create the **screenshot**, a bitmap (PNG) file.

    The slide commands take a screen shot of the
    target outline. The @pause option opens the
    target outline but does *not* take the
    screenshot. The user must take the screenshot
    manually. For more details, see the the
    options section below.

  C. Convert the screenshot file to a **work file**.

    The work file is an SVG (Scalable Vector
    Graphics) file: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/.

  D. (Optional) Edit the work file.

    If the @slide node has a child @edit node, the
    plugin opens Inkscape so that the user can
    edit the work file.

  E. Render the **final output file**.

    The plugin calls Inkscape non-interactively to
    render the final output file (a PNG image)
    from the work file. If the Python Imaging
    Library (PIL) is available, this step will use
    PIL to improve the quality of the final output
    file.

3. Build the slide using Sphinx.

  After making all files, the plugins runs Sphinx
  by running 'make html' in the slideshow folder.
  This command creates the final .html files in the
  _build/html subfolder of the slideshow folder.

4. Create url nodes.

  Depending on options, and already-existing @url
  nodes, the make-slide and make-slide-show
  commands may create one or more of the following
  @url nodes::

    @url built slide
    @url screenshot
    @url working file 
    @url final output file

**Options and settings**

You specify options in the headlines of nodes. **Global options** appear as direct children of @slideshow nodes and apply to all @slide nodes unless overridden by a local option. **Local options** appear as direct children of an @slide node and apply to only to that @slide node.

**Global options nodes**

The following nodes may appear *either* as a direct child of the @slideshow node or as the direct child of an @slide node.

@sphinx_path = &lt;path&gt;
  This directory contains the slides directory,
  and the following files: 'conf.py',
  'Leo4-80-border.jpg', 'Makefile' and 'make.bat'.

@screenshot_height = &lt;int&gt;
  The height in pixels of screenshots.

@screenshot_width = &lt;int&gt;
  The height in pixels of screenshots.

@template_fn = &lt;path&gt;
  The absolute path to inkscape-template.svg

@title = &lt;any text&gt;
  The title to use for one slide or the entire
  slideshow.

@title_pattern = &lt;pattern&gt;
  The pattern used to generate patterns for one
  slide or the entire slideshow. The title is
  computed as follows::

    d = {
        'slideshow_name':slideshow_name,
        'slide_name':    slide_name,
        'slide_number':  sc.slide_number,
    }
    title = (pattern % (d)).title()

  If neither an @title or @title_pattern option
  node applies, the title is the headline of the
  @slide node. If this is empty, the default
  pattern is::

    '%(slideshow_name)s:%(slide_number)s'

\@verbose = True/False
  True (or true or 1):  generate informational message.
  False (or false or 0): suppress informational messages.

\@wink_path = &lt;path&gt;
  This path contains screenshots created by wink.
  This is used only by the meld-slides command.

**Local options nodes**

The following nodes are valid only as the direct child of an @slide node.

@callout &lt;any text&gt;
  Generates a text callout in the working .svg file.
  An @slide node may have several @callout children.

@edit = True/False
  If True (or true or 1) the plugin enters
  Inkscape interactively after taking a
  screenshot.

@markers = &lt;list of integers&gt;
  Generates 'numbered balls' in the working .svg file.

@pause = True/False
  If True (or true or 1) the user must take the
  screenshot manually. Otherwise, the plugin takes
  the screenshot automatically.

  If the slide node contains an @pause node as one
  of its directive children, the slide commands
  open the target node, but do *not* take a screen
  shot.

  The user may adjust the screen as desired, for
  example by selecting menus or showing dialogs.
  The *user* must then take the screen shot
  manually. **Important**: the screenshot need not
  be of Leo--it could be a screenshot of anything
  on the screen.

  As soon as the user closes the target
  outline, the slide commands look for the screen
  shot on the clipboard. If found, the slide
  commands save the screenshot to the screenshot
  file.

@screenshot
  The root of a tree that becomes the entire
  contents of screenshot. No screenshot is taken
  if this node does not exist.

@select &lt;headline&gt;
  Causes the given headline in the @screenshot
  outline to be selected before taking the screenshot.

**Settings**

@string screenshot-bin = &lt;path to inkscape.exe&gt;
  The full path to the Inkscape program.   

**File names**

Suppose the @slide node is the n'th @slide node in the @slideshow tree whose sanitized name is 'name'. The following files will be created in (relative to) the slideshow directory::

    slide-n.html.txt:   the slide's rST source.
    screenshot-n.png:   the original screenshot.
    screenshot-n.svg:   the working file.
    slide-n.png:        the final output file.
    _build/html/slide-n.html: the final slide.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9477">Manages BibTeX files with Leo.

Create a bibliographic database by putting '@bibtex filename' in a headline. Entries are added as nodes, with '@entrytype key' as the headline, and the contents of the entry in body text. The plugin will automatically insert a template for the entry in the body pane when a new entry is created (hooked to pressing enter when typing the headline text). The templates are defined in dictionary 'templates' in the \&lt;\&lt;globals\&gt;\&gt; section, by default containing all required fields for every entry.

The file is written by double-clicking the node. Thus the following outline::

    -@bibtex biblio.bib
     +@book key
      author = {A. Uthor},
      year = 1999

will be written in the file 'biblio.bib' as::

    @book{key,
    author = {A. Uthor},
    year= 1999}

Strings are defined in @string nodes and they can contain multiple entries. All @string nodes are written at the start of the file. Thus the following outline::

    -@bibtext biblio.bib
     +@string
      j1 = {Journal1}
     +@article AUj1
      author = {A. Uthor},
      journal = j1
     +@string
      j2 = {Journal2}
      j3 = {Journal3}

Will be written as::

    @string{j1 = {Journal1}}
    @string{j2 = {Journal2}}
    @string{j3 = {Journal3}}

    @article{AUj1,
    author = {A. Uthor},
    journal = j1}

No error checking is made on the syntax. The entries can be organized under nodes --- if the headline doesn't start with '@', the headline and body text are ignored, but the child nodes are parsed as usual.

BibTeX files can be imported by creating an empty node with '@bibtex filename' in the headline. Double-clicking it will read the file 'filename' and parse it into a @bibtex tree. No syntax checking is made, 'filename' is expected to be a valid BibTeX file.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9483">Supports Uniform Node Locators (UNL's) for linking to nodes in any Leo file.

UNL's specify nodes within any Leo file. You can use them to create cross-Leo-file links! UNL

This plugin consists of two parts:

1) Selecting a node shows the UNL in the status line at the bottom of the Leo window. You can copy from the status line and paste it into headlines, emails, whatever.

2) Double-clicking @url nodes containing UNL's select the node specified in the UNL. If the UNL species in another Leo file, the other file will be opened.

Format of UNL's:

UNL's referring to nodes within the present outline have the form::

    headline1--&gt;headline2--&gt;...--&gt;headlineN

headline1 is the headline of a top-level node, and each successive headline is the headline of a child node.

UNL's of the form::

    file:&lt;path&gt;#headline1--&gt;...--&gt;headlineN

refer to a node specified in &lt;path&gt; For example, double clicking the following headline will take you to Chapter 8 of Leo's Users Guide::

    @url file:c:/prog/leoCvs/leo/doc/leoDocs.leo#Users Guide--&gt;Chapter 8: Customizing Leo

For example, suppose you want to email someone with comments about a Leo file. Create a comments.leo file containing @url UNL nodes. That is, headlines are @url followed by a UNL. The body text contains your comments about the nodes in the _other_ Leo file! Send the comments.leo to your friend, who can use the comments.leo file to quickly navigate to the various nodes you are talking about. As another example, you can copy UNL's into emails. The recipient can navigate to the nodes 'by hand' by following the arrows in the UNL.

**Notes**:

This plugin puts two buttons in the icon area: a button called 'Save Hoist' and a button called 'Dehoist'. The 'Save Hoist' button hoists the presently selected node and creates a button which can later rehoist the same node. The 'Dehoist' button performs one level of dehoisting

:20100226: see also leoscreen.py for a simpler approach.

Currently implements `bash` shell and `psql` (postresql SQL db shell).

Single-line commands can be entered in the headline with a blank body, multi-line commands can be entered in the body with a descriptive title in the headline.  Press the `bash` or `psql` button to send the command to the appropriate interpreter.

The output from the command is **always** stored in a new node added as the first child of the command node.  For multi-line commands this new node is selected.  For single-line command this new node is not shown, instead the body text of the command node is updated to reflect the most recent output.  Comment delimiter magic is used to allow single-line and multi-line commands to maintain their single-line and multi-line flavors.

Both the new child nodes and the updated body text of single-line commands are timestamped.

For the `bash` button the execution directory is either the directory containing the `.leo` file, or any other path as specified by ancestor `@path` nodes.

Currently the `psql` button just connects to the default database.  ";" is required at the end of SQL statements.

Requires `pexpect` module.

Selecting these menu items will bring up a short **About Plugin** dialog with the details of the plugin. In some circumstances a submenu will be created instead and an 'About' menu entry will be created in this.

**INI files and the Properties Dialog**

If a file exists in the plugins directory with the same file name as the plugin but with a .ini extension instead of .py, then a **Properties** item will be created in a submenu. Selecting this item will pop up a Properties Dialog which will allow the contents of this file to be edited.

The .ini file should be formated for use by the python ConfigParser class.

**Special Methods**

Certain methods defined at the top level are considered special.

cmd_XZY
    If a method is defined at the module level with a name of the form
    **cmd_XZY** then a menu item **XZY** will be created which will invoke
    **cmd_XZY** when it is selected. These menus will appear in a sub menu.

topLevelMenu
    This method, if it exists, will be called when the user clicks on the plugin
    name in the plugins menu (or the **About** item in its submenu), but only if
    the plugin was loaded properly and registered with g.plugin_signon.

**Special Variable Names**

Some names defined at the top level have special significance.

__plugin_name__
    This will be used to define the name of the plugin and will be used
    as a label for its menu entry.

__plugin_priority__
    Plugins can also attempt to select the order they will appear in the menu by
    defining a __plugin_prioriy__. The menu will be created with the highest
    priority items first. This behavior is not guaranteed since other plugins
    can define any priority. This priority does not affect the order of calling
    handlers.
    To change the order select a number outside the range 0-200 since this range
    is used internally for sorting alphabetically. Properties and INI files.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9798">Allows the definition of double-click actions.

When the user double-clicks a node this plugin checks for a match of the clicked node's headline text with a list of patterns. If a match occurs, the plugin executes the associated script.

**nodeAction** nodes may be located anywhere in the outline. Such nodes should contain one or more **pattern nodes** as children. The headline of each pattern node contains the pattern; the body text contains the script to be executed when the pattern matches the double-clicked node.

For example, the "nodeActions" node containing a "launch URL" pattern node and a "pre-process python code" node could be placed under an "@settings" node::

   @settings
   |
   +- nodeActions
      |
      +- http:\\*
      |
      +- @file *.py

**Configuration**

The nodeActions plugin supports the following global configurations using Leo's support for setting global variables within an @settings node's sub-nodes in the leoSettings.leo, myLeoSettings.leo, and the project Leo file:

@bool nodeActions_save_atFile_nodes = False

  :True:
     Double-click on an @file type node will save the file to disk
     before executing the script.

  :False:
     Double-click on an @file type node will **not** save the file to disk
     before executing the script. (default)

@int nodeActions_message_level = 1

  Specifies the type of messages to be sent to the log pane.  Specifying a
  higher message level will display that level and all lower levels.
  The following integer values are supported::

    0 no messages
    1 Plugin triggered and the patterns that were matched (default)
    2 Double-click event passed or not to next plugin
    3 Patterns that did not match
    4 Code debugging messages

**Patterns**

Pattern matching is performed using python's support for Unix shell-style patterns unless overwritten by the "X" pattern directive. The following pattern elements are supported::

    *           matches everything
    ?           matches any single character
    [&lt;seq&gt;]     matches any character in &lt;seq&gt;
    [!&lt;seq&gt;]    matches any character **not** in &lt;seq&gt;

Unix shell-style pattern matching is case insensitive and always starts from the beginning of the headline.  For example:

     ======= =========== ==============
     Pattern   Matches   Does not match
     ======= =========== ==============
     \*.py   Abc_Test.py
     .py     .py - Test  Abc_Test.py
     test*   Test_Abc.py Abc_Test.py
     ======= =========== ==============

To enable a script to run on any type of @file node (@thin, @shadow, ...), the pattern can start with "@files" to match on any external file type.  For example, the pattern "@files \*.py" will match a node with the headline "@file abcd.py".

The headline of the double-clicked node is matched against the patterns starting from the first sub-node under the "nodeActions" node to the last sub-node.

Only the script associated with the first matching pattern is invoked unless overwritten by the "V" pattern directive.

Using the "V" pattern directive allows a broad pattern such as "@files \*.py" to be invoked, and then, by placing a more restrictive pattern above it, such as "@files \*_test.py", a different script can be executed for those files requiring pre-processing::

  +- nodeActions
     |
     +- @files *_test.py
     |
     +- @files *.py

**Note**: To prevent Leo from trying to save patterns that begin with a derived file directive (@file, @auto, ...) to disk, such as "@file \*.py", place the "@ignore" directive in the body of the "nodeActions" node.

Pattern nodes can be placed at any level under the "nodeActions" node. Only nodes with no child nodes are considered pattern nodes. This allows patterns that are to be used in multiple Leo files to be read from a file.  For example, the following structure reads the pattern definition from the "C:\\Leo\\nodeActions_Patterns.txt" file::

    +- nodeActions
    |
    +- @files C:\\Leo\\nodeActions_Patterns.txt
        |
        +- http:\\*
        |
        +- @file *.py

**Pattern directives**

The following pattern specific directives can be appended to the end of a pattern (do not include the ':'):

:[X]:
  Use python's regular expression type patterns instead of the Unix
  shell-style pattern syntax.

  For example, the following patterns will match the same headline string::

     Unix shell-style pattern:
        @files *.py

     Regular Expression pattern:
        ^@files .*\.py$ [X]

:[V]:
  Matching the pattern will not block the double-click event from
  being passed to the remaining patterns.
  The "V" represents a down arrow that symbolizes the passing of the event
  to the next pattern below it.

  For example, adding the "[V]" directive to the "@files \*_test.py" in
  the Patterns section above, changes its script from being 'an
  alternate to' to being 'a pre-processor for' the "@files \*.py" script::

     +- nodeActions
        |
        +- @files *_test.py [V]
        |
        +- @files *.py

:[&gt;]:
  Matching the pattern will not block the double-click event from being
  passed to other plugins.
  The "&gt;" represents a right arrow that
  symbolizes the passing of the event to the next plugin.

  If the headline matched more than one headline,
  the double-click event will be passed to the next plugin if the
  directive is associated with any of the matched patterns.

The directive(s) for a pattern must be contained within a single set of brackets, separated from the pattern by a space, with or without a comma separator.  For example, the following specifies all three directives::

  ^@files .*\.py$ [X,V&gt;]

**Scripts**

The script for a pattern is located in the body of the pattern's node. The following global variables are available to the script::

    c
    g
    pClicked - node position of the double-clicked node
    pScript - node position of the invoked script

**Examples**

Double-clicking on a node with a "http:\\\\www.google.com" headline will invoke the script associated with the "http:\\\\\*" pattern.  The following script in the body of the pattern's node displays the URL in a browser::

     import webbrowser
     hClicked = pClicked.h     #Clicked node's Headline text
     webbrowser.open(hClicked) #Invoke browser

The following script can be placed in the body of a pattern's node to execute a command in the first line of the body of a double-clicked node::

     g.os.system('"Start /b ' + pClicked.bodyString() + '"')
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9800">Converts a leo outline to an html web page.

This plugin takes an outline stored in Leo and converts it to html which is then either saved in a file or shown in a browser. It is based on the original leoToHTML 1.0 plugin by Dan Rahmel which had bullet list code by Mike Crowe.

The outline can be represented as a bullet list, a numbered list or using html &lt;h?&gt; type headings. Optionally, the body text may be included in the output.

If desired, only the current node will be included in the output rather than the entire outline.

An xhtml header may be included in the output, in which case the code will be valid XHTML 1.0 Strict.

The plugin is fully scriptable as all its functionality is available through a Leo_to_HTML object which can be imported and used in scripts.

**Menu items and @settings**

If this plugin loads properly, the following menu items should appear in your File &gt; Export... menu in Leo::

    Save Outline as HTML  (equivalent to export-html)
    Save Node as HTML     (equivalent to export-html-node)
    Show Outline as HTML  (equivalent to show-html)
    Show Node as HTML     (equivalent to show-html-node)

*Unless* the following appears in an @setting tree::

    @bool leo_to_html_no_menus = True

in which case the menus will **not** be created. This is so that the user can use @menu and @item to decide which commands will appear in the menu and where.

**Commands**

Several commands will also be made available

export-html
  will export to a file according to current settings.
export-html-*
  will export to a file using bullet type '*' which can be
  **number**, **bullet** or **head**.

The following commands will start a browser showing the html.

show-html
  will show the outline according to current settings.

show-html-*
  will show the outline using bullet type '*' which can be
  **number**, **bullet** or **head**.

The following commands are the same as above except only the current node is converted::

    export-html-node
    export-html-node-*
    show-html-node
    show-html-node-*

**Properties**

There are several settings that can appear in the leo_to_html.ini properties file in leo's plugins folder or be set via the Plugins &gt; leo_to_html &gt; Properties... menu. These are:

exportpath:
    The path to the folder where you want to store the generated html file.
    Default: c:\\

flagjustheadlines:
    Default: 'Yes' to include only headlines in the output.

flagignorefiles:
    Default: 'Yes' to ignore @file nodes.

use_xhtml:
    Yes to include xhtml doctype declarations and make the file valid XHTML 1.0 Strict.
    Otherwise only a simple &lt;html&gt; tag is used although the output will be xhtml
    compliant otherwise. Default: Yes

bullet_type:
    If this is 'bullet' then the output will be in the form of a bulleted list.
    If this is 'number' then the output will be in the form of a numbered list.
    If this is 'heading' then the output will use &lt;h?&gt; style headers.

    Anything else will result in &lt;h?&gt; type tags being used where '?' will be a
    digit starting at 1 and increasing up to a maximum of six depending on depth
    of nesting. Default: number

browser_command:
    Set this to the command needed to launch a browser on your system or leave it blank
    to use your systems default browser.

    If this is an empty string or the browser can not be launched using this command then
    python's `webbrowser` module will be tried. Using a bad command here will slow down the
    launch of the default browser, better to leave it blank.
    Default: empty string

**Configuration**

At present, the file leo/plugins/leo_to_html.ini contains configuration settings. In particular, the default export path, "c:\" must be changed for \*nix systems.

'''Leo''' ('''L'''eonine '''E'''ditor with '''O'''utlines) is a [[text editor]]
that features [[outliner|outlines]] with clones as its central tool of
organization, navigation, customization and scripting.

==Language==

Leo is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Qt
(toolkit)|Qt]]. It is fully scriptable using Python and can be extended with
plugins. In Leo, outlines are hierarchical data structures that people use to
work with and manage text files—including code.

==Trees, clones and views==

Leo is an [[outliner]]. Leo's outline pane shows a [[tree (data structure)]] of data nodes.
Nodes contain headlines, body text, and other information.
Headlines naturally serve as descriptions of the body text.
For example, @file nodes are nodes whose headline starts with @file.

Leo trees are in fact [[directed acyclic graph|directed acyclic graphs]];
nodes may have more than one parent.
Leo calls such nodes clones.
Clones appear in several places in the outline pane.

Views are simply nodes whose children contain clones. A single outline may contain
arbitrarily many views of the nodes contained therein.
Views and clones turn Leo into a supremely flexible filing cabinet: any node may be filed
in arbitrarily many places.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://leoeditor.com/nutshell.html Leo documentation: Leo in a Nutshell]&lt;/ref&gt;

==External files==

@file nodes represent external files, files on the computer's file system.
When saving an outline Leo automatically writes all changed @file
trees back to the external files.
Comments, called sentinel lines, in external files represent the outline structure.
When reading an outline, these comments allows Leo to recreate
@file trees using only the data in the external file.

@auto nodes represent external files without using sentinel comments.
When reading @auto nodes, Leo uses the program structure of the external file
to create the @auto tree.

==Scripting==

Leo's scripting environment takes full advantage of outline structure:

* The body text of any node may contain a Leo script, a Python script executed in the context of a Leo outline.

* A simple [[API]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://leoeditor.com/scripting.html Leo documentation: Scripting Leo with Python]&lt;/ref&gt; gives Leo scripts full access to all data in loaded outlines, as well as full access to Leo's own source code. The API includes Python [[iterators]] that allow scripts to traverse outlines easily.

* Scripts may be composed of any tree of nodes.
  A [[markup language]] similar to [[noweb]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://leoeditor.com/tutorial.html#section-references Leo documentation: Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt; tells Leo how to create scripts from (parts of) an outline.

* Headlines naturally control and guide scripts.

** @test nodes represent unit tests. Leo can execute the body of an @test node as unit test, without the body having to create an explicit subclass of Python's UnitTest.TestCase class. &lt;ref&gt;[

** @button nodes contain scripts that can be applied to other nodes.  In effect, @button nodes create user-defined commands. &lt;ref&gt;

    pair: Autocompletion; Tutorial
    
Autocompletion reminds you of all members (functions, methods, ivars, etc.) contained in objects in Leo's source code, and in Python's standard library modules.

Alt-1 (toggle-autocompleter) enables and disables autocompletion. **Note**: Autocompletion can be enabled only when @language python is in effect.

For example, typing just "c.atF" (in the body pane, with autocompletion enabled) automatically inserts "c.atFileCommands" into the body pane, because "c.atFileCommands" is the only possible completion of "c.atF".

As another example, typing "at.writeA" will show (in an autocompleter tab in the Log pane) all of the write commands in leoAtFile.py::

    writeAll:method
    writeAllHelper:method
    writeAtAutoNodes:method
    writeAtAutoNodesHelper:method
    writeAtShadowNodes:method
    writeAtShadowNodesHelper:method

When a single completion is shown, typing '?' will show the docstring for a method. For example, "c.atFileCommands.write?" shows::

    Write a 4.x derived file.
    root is the position of an @&lt;file&gt; node
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101125062332.5090">Leo requires the `Python`_ and `PyQt_` package.
The `PyEnchant`_ package is optional. 

**Python**: Leo will work on any platform that supports Python 2.6 or above, including Python 3.0 and above. To install Python, see http://python.org.

**PyQt**: PyQt provides Leo's widgets. To install PyQt, get the binary package from: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download The PyQt version must match your installed Python version. Remember that Leo requires Python 2.6 or later, or Python 3.0 or later. Now run the binary PyQt installer.

**PyEnchant**: You must install the PyEnchant package if you want to use Leo's Spell tab. Download and install the PyEnchant package from http://pythonhosted.org/pyenchant/download.html There is an executable installer for Windows users.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20110521135104.18151">Cross-file clones are cloned nodes in one outline that refer to data in another outline. This is a frequently requested feature. For example::

    I would absolutely love to have the leo files in different project
    directories, and a "master" leo file to rule them all.

However, cross-file clones will never be a part of Leo. Indeed, cross-file clones would violate the principle that data should be defined and managed in exactly one place. Just as human managers would not willingly accept shared responsibility for even a single line of code, every piece of Leonine data should be the responsibility of one and *only* one .leo file.

The problem is fundamental. If the *same* (cloned) data were "owned" by two different Leo files we would have a classic "multiple update problem" for the data. Each outline could change the data in incompatible ways, and whichever outline changed the data last would "win."

To make such a scheme workable and safe, one would have to devise a scheme that would keep the data in "component" .leo files consistent even when the component .leo files changed "randomly", without the "master" .leo file being in *any* way in "control" of the changes. Good luck :-)

Let us be clear: it's no good having a scheme that works *most* of the time, it must work *all* the time, even with unexpected or even pathological file updates. If it doesn't you are asking for, and will eventually get, catastrophic data loss, without being aware of the loss for an arbitrarily long period of time. Even with a source code control system this would be an intolerable situation.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20110531155858.20559">.. _`This FAQ entry`: FAQ.html#how-can-i-use-leo-to-develop-leo-itself

Here is the workflow I use to develop Leo. The intention is to help present and potential developers use Leo effectively.

Overview:

- Develop in an outline containing all of Leo's source files. Close this outline rarely: this keeps the code I am using stable while I'm hacking the code.

- Test in a *separate* .leo file, say test.leo. In fact, I often test in a private file, ekr.leo, so that test.leo doesn't get continually updated on git with trivial changes.

These two points are covered in a bit more detail in `This FAQ entry`_.

Additional tips:

A. Avoid using the mouse whenever possible. For example, use alt-tab to switch between windows.

B. Always develop Leo in a console. This allows you to see the output of g.trace.

Speaking of g.trace, I hardly ever use 'print' because g.trace prints the name of the function or method in which it appears. The typical pattern for enabling traces is::

    trace = True and not g.unitTesting
    if trace: g.trace(whatever)

This pattern is especially useful when a method contains multiple calls to g.trace.

C. I use scripts to open particular Leo files. These are batch files on Windows, and aliases on Linux, but invoking them is the same on either platform::

    all:     opens all my main development files using the qt-tabs gui.
    t:       opens test.leo.
    e:       opens ekr.leo.  I use this file for private testing.
    d:       opens LeoDocs.leo.
    s:       opens LeoPy.leo.
    plugins: opens leoPlugins.leo.
    gui:     opens leoGui.leo.
    u:       opens unitTest.leo.

These run Leo with Python 3.x. There are similar scripts, ending in 2, that run Leo with Python 2.x. For example, u2 opens unitTest.leo with Python 2.x. Thus, to run a test, I alt-tab to an available console window, then type 'e' or 't' or 'u' or, if I want Python 2.x, 'e2' or 't2' or 'u2'.

D. Use clones to focus attention on the task at hand. For more details, see the tutorial's introduction to `clones`_.

E. For thousand of example of my programming style, see leoPy.leo and leoGuiPlugins.leo. The projects section in leoPy.leo contains many examples of using clones to create view nodes. I typically delete the clones in the views shortly before a release.

Writing documentation:

- Use postings as pre-writing for documentation. I don't mind blabbing on and on about Leo because all my posts become pre-writing for Leo's documentation. I simply copy posts to nodes in the "documentation to-do" section. At release time, I edit these nodes and put them in Leo's main documentation or the release notes. This posting is an example.
  
- Use the vr command to debug reStructuredText documentation. The viewrendered pane updates as you type. This makes Leo a killer app for rST.
   
Administrative tips:

- Never rely on memory. A project like this contains thousands and thousands of details. Everything eventually goes into a Leo node somewhere. If it doesn't it surely *will* be forgotten.

- Do easy items first. This keeps to-do lists short, which keeps energy high.

While expanding any section, the rst3 will not expand again any sections that have already occurred in the expansion.

``expand_noweb_references``
   True: Replace references by definitions. Definitions must be descendants of the referencing node.

``ignore_noweb_definitions``
    True: ignore section definition nodes.

``expand_noweb_recursively``
    True: recursively expand definitions by expanding any references found in definitions.
        
**Note**: This is an experimental feature: all aspects might changed. The defaults for all these options ensure that the rst3 command works as it has always.

Leo's core code is always being improved and developed. Unit-testing ensures that the daily commits are as bug-free as possible. Almost all of the time, downloading the most recent `nightly snapshot`_ of the development code is going to give you code that is just as stable and much more up-to-date than the most recent `latest stable release`_ which most Leonistas would consider already outdated.

If you are just checking Leo out, feel free to use the `latest stable release`_ download if it makes you feel more secure, but once you've decided to work with Leo on a regular basis, we highly recommend regularly keeping your installation up to date with the most recent `nightly snapshot`_.

To summarize, you may get Leo in three ways:

1. Download the `latest stable release`_ from `SourceForge`_. This release contains an executable installer. This release will usually be a bit out of date.

2. Download `snapshots`_ (see below) from github. You can get the very latest development version, or a version from from 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 or 90 days ago.
   
3. Download `Leo's latest sources`_ from `GitHub`_ using `git`_. Once git is installed, getting the latest version of Leo is very easy::
   
        git clone https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor.git (http access)
    
   or::

        git clone git@github.com:leo-editor/leo-editor.git (ssh access)

Many thanks to Ludwig Schwardt for the following installation instructions.
Using the HomeBrew installation method is *much* easier than before.

I recently received a new MacBook Pro and did a fresh upgrade to Mac OS
10.7 (Lion). I then used the opportunity to test out installation
procedures of various software on a clean system. My main finding is that
the excellent Homebrew (mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) makes things much easier
these days.

Why Homebrew? It does not try to replace every single bit of functionality
on your Mac with their own version, like Macports or fink. It reuses the
existing libraries as far as possible. No need to reinstall Python, for
example (one of my pet gripes when people try to install new software on
their Macs, and the source of much confusion and pain). It installs to
/usr/local, the standard place to find third-party libraries and headers,
instead of the obscure /opt or /sw. It's simple to use and to extend.

Here is my installation write-up:

- Read the Homebrew installation instructions at http://brew.sh/

- Make sure you have Xcode installed (test it by confirming that "gcc" runs
  in the Terminal). Only the smaller command-line tools are required;
  there is no need to get the full Xcode beast.

- In preparation for Homebrew, the best option in my opinion is
  to delete /usr/local via::

    sudo rm -rf /usr/local

  and install any software in it via HomeBrew instead.
  
  Note from EKR: The HomeBrew package manager is so easy to use
  that you will find replacing deleted packages a snap.
  
  If deleting /usr/local fills you with dread (you do not want to lose your
  beloved third-party software), the second-best option is to make sure you
  have write permission for the directory via::

    sudo chown -R &lt;your user name&gt;:admin /usr/local

  If you don't know your username, run "whoami". :-) This is
  useful because homebrew actually discourages you from
  installing third-party software as the superuser (the usual Mac
  apps in /Applications are also installed as the normal user,
  for that matter).

- Install Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) by running the
  following command in the Terminal::
    
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

- Run "brew doctor" and check any further suggestions to improve your system.

  EKR note: I thought I had installed command-line tools after installing
  the XCode page. I hadn't, and "brew doctor" told me so.

- Run "brew update" to get the latest formulas

- Install sip and note the caveat::

    brew install sip

  This warns you to add the local python directory to your PYTHONPATH.
  Make a note of what this is (especially if you are not on Lion!).

- Add the following lines to your ~/.bash_profile
  (or ~/.profile on Leopard). This is the default for LION::

      export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
      # This is for SIP (and PyQt) as suggested by Homebrew
      export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

- Install PyQt::

    brew install pyqt
 
- Open a new Terminal tab / window so that the above settings take effect,
  and install Leo. I downloaded the Leo-4.9-final-a.zip, unzipped it, and
  ran "python launchLeo.py" inside the Leo directory.

It would really be great to get a Leo formula going for Homebrew. As
mentioned before, the main question is just where to place all the Leo
files in the /usr/local hierarchy.

Using @command rather than @button means that there is never any need to disable scripts. There is no need for @button. To see the list of your @command nodes, type::

    &lt;alt-x&gt;@c&lt;tab&gt;

But you don't have to do that.  Instead, use Alt-tab once to change away from Leo, and then use Alt-tab again to change back to Leo.  When you do this, Leo puts focus in the body pane and you are all set.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.15125">When running unit tests externally, Leo copies any @mark-for-unit-tests nodes to dynamicUnitTest.leo.  Of course, this is in addition to all @test nodes and @suite nodes that are to be executed. You can use @mark-for-unit-test nodes to include any "supporting data" you want, including, say, "@common test code" to be imported as follows::

    exec(g.findTestScript(c,'@common test code'))

**Note**: putting @settings trees as descendants of an @mark-for-unit-test node will copy the @setting tree, but will *not* actually set the corresponding settings.

Q. When I run the following script I see a window appear and then immediately disappear::

    from PyQt4 import QtGui
    w = QtGui.QWidget()
    w.resize(250, 150)
    w.move(300, 300)
    w.setWindowTitle('Simple test')
    w.show()
    
What's going on?

A. When the script exits the sole reference to the window, w, ceases to exist, so the window is destroyed (garbage collected). To keep the window open, add the following code as the last line to keep the reference alive::

    g.app.scriptsDict['my-script_w'] = w

This reference will persist until the next time you run the execute-script. If you want something even more permanent, you can do something like::

    g.app.my_script_w = w

2. Download the nightly snapshot zip file.
3. Unzip it into the same place as the previous version.

When using LaTeX and BibTeX, I would like to use inside of Leo a kind of LaTeX-inline-markup, that after generation of the RsT file through Sphinx as well as after running of "make latex", generate a LaTeX file containing the citation call of the form \cite{CITBook001} as described in a file \*.bib. Is there a way to have Leo/Sphinx/RsT generate the inline raw latex syntax?

<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.15152">Some people seem to think that it is difficult to understand how Leo handles "clone wars": differing values for a cloned nodes that appear in several external files. That's not true. The rule is::

    **The last clone that Leo reads wins.**

That is, for any cloned node C, Leo takes the value of C.h and C.b to be the values specified by the last copy that Leo reads.

There is only one complication::

    **Leo reads the entire outline before reading any external files.**

Thus, if C appears in x.leo, y.py and z.py, Leo will choose the value for C in x.py or y.py, depending on which @&lt;file&gt; node appears later in the outline.

**Note**: Whenever Leo detects multiple values for C when opening an outline, Leo creates a "Recovered nodes" tree. This tree contains all the various values for C, nicely formatted so that it is easy to determine where the differences are.

Whatever the method used, the import process has the potential to change many files. Usually, I just change @auto and @file to @@auto or @@file, so that any changes I make while studying the code won't affect the originals.

But this "safety first" approach means that I can't actually use Leo to insert tracing statements (or for any other changes.) Happily, there is a way to import "live" code into Leo safely::

   Create a git repository for the code before importing it

The Aha is to create the repository *wherever the code is*, including,
say, python/Lib/site-packages.

- git diff ensures that import hasn't significantly altered the code,

This is exactly what I need:  I can make changes to important tools *safely* within Leo.

<t tx="ekr.20130807203905.16597">*Important*: Leo's binary Windows installer sets file associations
automatically, so this section is needed only if you are installing Leo
from a .zip file or other sources.

There are two ways of associating .leo files with Leo. The first uses the
Windows control panel, the second, the Windows console.

**Method 1: Using the Windows Control Panel**

The goal is that you want to associate .leo files with the following command::

    "&lt;path to python&gt;\python.exe" "&lt;path to launchLeo.py&gt;\launchLeo.py" "%1"
    
Before Windows 7, you do this with using the Folder Options control panel.
In Windows 7, you do this with the Default Programs control panel.

*Note*: "%1" passes just the file being clicked on, quoted for spaces etc.
The quotation marks are needed to handle file paths containing spaces.

*Warning:* In a batch file, %1 passes just the first command line parameter.
It is logical to expect %* to work for file associations just as in batch
files. Alas, it does not.

**Method 2: Using the Windows Console**

Open a Windows console with administrator privileges, then type::

    ftype LeoFile="&lt;path to python&gt;\pythonw.exe" "&lt;path to launchLeo.py&gt;\launchLeo.py" "%1" %*
    assoc .leo=LeoFile

And put this leo.bat in %PATH%::

    @start /b "Leo" "&lt;path to python&gt;\python.exe" "&lt;path to launchLeo.py&gt;\launchLeo.py" %*
    
You may omit the /b option if you want to create a separate console window for Leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130807203905.16602">Leo has a binary installer for Windows, available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/ The binary installer
installs Leo and sets Windows file associations. Now see `Running Leo`_ for
how to run Leo after installing it.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130807203905.16603">You may download Leo's sources in one of three ways, as described at:
http://leoeditor.com/download.html If the sources are zipped, unpack them
into a temp folder. You may place the sources anywhere you like, including
Python's \*site-packages* folder, for example,
C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages.

Next, you will find it convenient to create Windows files associations for
.leo files, as described in the next section.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mylyn

I went on to start a "leo mylyn" plugin to exercise using the childrenModified and contentModified signals.

If you want to play with it, enable leomylyn.py, modify stuff around the tree and do alt-x mylyn-scores.

Of course as it is useless in this state, but becomes useful when it has a proper gui (maybe in Nav pane), where you would then have a list of "most interesting" nodes.

In the future, this could be able to remember the scores through the sessions, degrade the old scores by time, etc. Also, a scoreset would be associated with a "project" (e.g."own research", "work project foo"), each of them having their own typical node working set.

Mylyn was a nice boost back in the eclipse days, it could work for Leo too. My main motivation right now was to demonstrate the signals with something that is much simpler than using them in qmlnotebook.

<t tx="ekr.20130815102041.15631">Screencasts promise to be easy to be *much* easier to create than slideshows, while also being more interesting, informative and flashy.  It is *so* much easier to write a screencast script than it is to lay out a slide, take a screenshot, and then manage resulting slide.

In particular, there are few continuity problems with screencasts. Continuity is a *huge* problem with slideshows!  If I change one slide, I am likely to want to change all following slides.  Which means I have to retake all the slides, and file the new versions in the proper places.  In contrast, any changes to screencasts naturally propagate forward.  There might be an effect on following screencasts scenes, but this will happen rarely with a reasonable scene design, and any problems should be easy to fix.

With screencasts, the *movie* script is also the *python* script!  There is no "translation" from one to the other.  Furthermore, all the work to produce a screencast is done (naturally!) within Leo.  No need to create and manage external data.  This is another huge advantage and it make producing screencasts much faster than producing slideshows.

Screencasts may be the long-awaited tools that will allow me to show Leo in action so that other will finally be able to understand it easily.

<t tx="ekr.20131001045038.17448">This idea got started when I (Ville M. Vainio) saw this post by Edward Ream on IPython developer mailing list: http://lists.ipython.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2008-January/003551.html

I was using FreeMind as mind mapping software, and so I had an immediate use case for Leo (which, incidentally, is superior to FreeMind as mind mapper). The wheels started rolling, I got obsessed with the power of this concept (everything clicked together), and Edwards excitement paralleled mine. Everything was mind-bogglingly easy/trivial, something that is typical of all promising technologies.

The goal of close cooperation between Leo and IPython went from vague dream to completed reality over the span of about 10 days. The IPython bridge has continued to evolve since then.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001045038.18979">The IPython bridge turns Leo into another kind of `IPython Notebook`_. IPython users typically use %edit to produce non-trivial functions/classes instead of entering them directly on the interactive prompt. But this is a bit clumsy. With Leo, *every Leo node works like an IPython %edit file*:

- You can execute any Leo node in IPython with &lt;Alt-I&gt; (ipython-exec)
- Saving your Leo outline saves all your IPython scripts.
- You can use Leo as always to organize all your IPython scripts.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001045038.18980">*You can run any IPython script from Leo*. Leo's ipython-exec (Alt-I) command executes the body text of the presently selected Leo node in the address space of the IPython shell. Such scripts *immediately* affect the IPython interpreter.

The IPython bridge sets several global variables *within Leo*, allowing Leo scripts *complete* access to all of IPython's code and data:

- g.app.ipk.namespace is IPython's namespace.
- g.app.ipk.ipkernel is an IPython IPKernelApp object.
- g.app.ipk.ipkernel.shell is an IPython InteractiveShell object.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001045038.18981">*You can run any Leo script from IPython*. The IPython bridge injects an object called _leo into IPython's namespace. IPython scripts may access Leo's c and g objects as follows::

    c,g = _leo.c, _leo.g

This allows IPython scripts to do *anything* that a Leo script can do. Scripts run from IPython *immediately* change Leo, *exactly* as if the script were run from Leo.

**Important**: the _leo object is an instance of LeoNameSpace class, defined in leo.core.leoIPython.py. This class allows IPython scripts to access multiple Leo outlines at once. See the actual code for details.

**Note**: _leo.c is a property which can return None in some situations. Here is its definition:

.. code-block:: python

    def __get_c(self):
        '''Return the designated commander, or the only open commander.'''
        self.update()
        if self.commander and self.commander in self.commanders_list:
            return self.commander
        elif len(self.commanders_list) == 1:
            return self.commanders_list[0]
        else:
            return None
    
    def __set_c(self,c):
        '''Designate the commander to be returned by the getter.'''
        self.update()
        if c in self.commanders_list:
            self.commander = c
        else:
            g.trace(g.callers())
            raise ValueError(c)
    
    c = property(
        __get_c, __set_c,
        doc = "LeoNameSpace c property")
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001100236.15927">Leo's valuespace.py plugin uses the ipython namespace when the ``--ipython`` command line switch is in effect.

This plugin provides a "workbook" like way to get data from Leo document to the namespace, and do calculations based on that data. Having this data be accessible to the ipython instance makes it convenient to interact and poke around with the same data.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001100335.15938">This section explains how to use Leo's standard search/replace commands.
**Note**: you can also use the Nav Tab (in the Log pane) to search for text.

``Ctrl-F (start-search)`` shows the Find Tab and puts the focus in the text box labelled ``Find:``.

**Aside**: You can select radio buttons and toggle check boxes in the Find Tab with ``Ctrl-Alt keys``. The capitalized words of the radio buttons or check boxes indicate which key to use.  For example, ``Ctrl-Alt-X (toggle-find-regex-option)`` toggles the ``regeXp`` checkbox.

After typing ``Ctrl-F``, type the search string, say ``def``, in the text box.

Start the find command by typing ``&lt;Return&gt;``.

But suppose you want to replace ``def`` with ``foo``, instead of just finding ``def``.

Just type ``&lt;Tab&gt;`` before typing ``&lt;Return&gt;``. Focus shifts to the text box labelled ``Replace:``.

Finally, type ``&lt;Return&gt;`` to start the find-next command. When Leo finds the next instance of ``def``, it will select it.

You may now type any command.  The following are most useful:

- ``Ctrl-minus (replace-then-find)`` replaces the selected text.
- ``F3 (find-next)`` continues searching without making a replacement.
- ``F2 (find-previous)`` continues the search in reverse.
- ``Ctrl-G (keyboard-quit)`` ends the search.

Leo has a flexible (perhaps *too* flexible) configuration system. It's best to use this flexibility in a restricted way as follows:

1. The file leo/config/leoSettings.leo contains Leo's default **global settings**. Don't change this file unless you are one of Leo's developers.
   
2. The file ~/myLeoSettings.leo contains your **personal settings**. Leo will not create this file automatically: you should create it yourself. Settings in myLeoSettings.leo override (or add to) the default settings in leoSettings.leo.
   
3. Any other .leo file may also contain **local settings**. Local settings apply only to that file and override all other settings. It's best to use local settings sparingly.
   
As a result, settings may vary from one Leo file to another. This can be confusing. These two commands can help:

- ``print-settings`` shows each setting and where it came from.
- ``print-bindings`` shows each key binding and where it came from.

**Important**: within any file, settings take effect **only** if they are contained in an **@settings tree**, that is, are descendants of a node whose headline is @settings. Nodes outside @settings trees do not affect settings in any way.

Within ``@settings`` trees, you specify boolean settings with ``@bool`` nodes, string settings with ``@string`` nodes, menus with ``@menus`` and ``@menu`` nodes, etc. For exact details, please do study leoSettings.leo. You can open either leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo from the Help menu. Within leoSettings.leo:

- The node ``About this file`` explains about settings.
- The node ``Candidates for settings in myLeoSettings.leo`` highlights the settings you are most likely to want to customize.

    pair: Minibuffer; Tutorial
    pair: Tab completion; Tutorial

Leo’s minibuffer appears at the bottom of Leo’s main window. You use the minibuffer to execute commands by name, and also to accumulate arguments to commands.

``Alt-X (full-command)`` puts the cursor in the minibuffer.

You could type the full command name in the minibuffer, followed by the ``&lt;Return&gt;`` key to invoke the command, but that would be *way* too much work. Instead, you can avoid most typing using **tab completion**. With tab completion, *there is no need to remember the exact names of Leo’s commands*.

For example, suppose you want to print out the list of Leo’s commands. You might remember only that there are several related commands and that they all start with "print". Just type ``&lt;Alt-X&gt;pri&lt;Tab&gt;``

You will see ``print-`` in the minibuffer. This is the longest common prefix of all the command names that start with ``pri``. The Completion tab in the log pane shows all the commands that start with ``print-``.

Now just type ``c&lt;Tab&gt;`` You will see the ``print-commands`` command in the minibuffer.

Finally, ``&lt;Return&gt;`` executes the ``print-commands`` command. The output of the print-commands command appears in the commands tab, and focus returns to the body pane. 

**Summary**:

- ``&lt;Return&gt;`` executes the command.
- ``&lt;Tab&gt;`` shows all valid completions.
- ``&lt;BackSpace&gt;`` shows more alternatives.
- ``Ctrl-G`` exits the minibuffer and puts focus in the body pane.

Leo's main window consists of an **icon area** just below the menus, an **outline pane** at the top left, a **log pane** at the top right, a **body pane** at the bottom left, and an optional **viewrendered pane** at the bottom right. The **minibuffer** and **status line** lie at the bottom of the main window.

The log pane contains several tabs. The **Log tab** shows messages from Leo, the **Find Tab** shows the status of Leo's Find/Replace commands. Other tabs may also appear in the log pane: The **Spell Tab** controls Leo's spell-checking. The **Completion Tab** shows available typing completions.

Leo stores all data in **nodes**. Nodes have **headlines**, shown in the outline pane, and **body text**. The body pane shows the body text of the **presently selected node**, the node whose headline is selected in the outline pane.  Headlines have an **icon box** indicating a nodes status. For example, the icon box has a black border when the node has been changed.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131002055813.19036">You may select, expand and contract outline nodes with the mouse as usual, but using arrow keys is *highly recommended*. When focus is in the outline pane, *plain* arrows keys change the selected node:

``Right-arrow (expand-and-go-right)``
    Expands a node or selects its first child.
``Left-arrow (contract-or-go-left)``
    Contracts a node if its children are visible, and selects the node's parent otherwise.
``Up-arrow (goto-prev-visible)``
    Selects the previous *visible* outline node.
``Down-arrow (goto-next-visible)``
    Selects the next *visible* outline node.
  
Regardless of focus, ``Alt-arrow`` select outline nodes:

``Alt-Home (goto-first-visible-node)``
    Selects the first outline node.
``Alt-End (goto-last-visible-node)``
    Selects the last *visible* outline node.
``Alt-arrow keys``
    Select the outline pane, and then act just like the plain arrow keys when the outline pane has focus.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131002055813.19037">When focus is in any of Leo's text panes (body pane, log pane, headlines), Leo works like most text editors:

- ``Plain arrow`` keys move the cursor up, down, left or right.
- ``Ctrl-LeftArrow`` and ``Ctrl-RightArrow`` move the cursor by words.
- ``Home`` and ``End`` move the cursor to the beginning or end of a line.
- ``Ctrl-Home`` moves the cursor to the beginning of the body text.
- ``Ctrl-End`` moves the cursor to the end of the body text.
- ``PageDown`` and ``PageUp`` move the cursor up or down one page.

**Note**: As usual, adding the ``Shift`` key modifier to any of the keys above moves the cursor and extends the selected text.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131002055813.19835">``Ctrl-I or Insert (insert-node)``
    Inserts a new node into the outline.
``Ctrl-H (edit-headline)``
    Begins editing the headline of the selected node.
``Return``
    When focus is in the outline pane, ``&lt;Return&gt;`` ends editing ``(end-edit-headline)`` or switches focus to the body pane.
``Ctrl-Shift-C (copy-node)``
    Copies the outline and all it's descendants, placing the node on the clipboard.
``Ctrl-Shift-X (cut-node)``
    Cuts the outline and all its descendants, placing the node on the clipboard.
``Ctrl-Shift-V (paste-node)``
    Pastes a node (and its descendants) from the clipboard after the presently selected node.
``Ctrl-M (mark)``
    Toggles the mark on a node. Marked nodes have a vertical red bar in their icon area.
``Ctrl-} (demote)``
    Makes all following siblings of a node children of the node. Use ``demote`` to "gather" nodes so they can all be moved with their parent.
``Ctrl-{ (promote)``
    Makes all the children of a node siblings of the node. Use ``demote`` to "scatter" the nodes after moving their parent.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131002055813.19837">Leo has unlimited undo--Leo remembers *all* changes you make to outline structure or the contents of any node since you restarted Leo.

``Ctrl-Z (undo)``
    Undoes the last change. Another Ctrl-Z undoes the previous change, etc.
``Ctrl-Shift-Z (redo)``
    Undoes the effect of the last undo, etc.

The first two entries of the ``Edit`` menu show what the next undo or redo operation will be.

    pair: @file node; Tutorial
    
Leo stores outline data on your file system in **.leo files**.

Rather than storing all your data in the .leo file, you may store parts of your outline data in **external files**, files on your file system.

**@file nodes** create external files. @file nodes have headlines starting with @file followed by a file name::

    @file leoNodes.py
    @file ../../notes.text
    
.. index::
    pair: Dirty node; Tutorial

Leo reads external files automatically when you open Leo outline, and writes all **dirty** (changed) external files when you save any Leo outline.

.. index::
    pair: @all; Tutorial
    pair: Outline Order; Tutorial

The **@all** directive tells Leo to write the **@file tree** (the @file node and all its descendants) to the external file in **outline order**, the order in which the nodes appear in the outline pane when all nodes are expanded. Non-programmers will typically use the @all directive; programmers typically use the @others directive, as discussed in the `programming tutorial`_. The @all directive may appear anywhere in the body text of the root @file node.

The @all directivive is designed for "catch-all" files, like todo.txt or notes.txt or whatever. Such files are assumed to contain a random collection of nodes, so there is no language in effect and no real comment delimiters.

.. index::
    pair: Sentinel Comments; Tutorial
    pair: Sentinel Lines; Tutorial

When writing @file nodes, Leo adds **sentinel comments** to external files. Sentinels embed Leo's outline structure into external files. If you don't want sentinels in your sources, skip head to the `Using @clean nodes`_, part of Leo's `programming tutorial`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131003040744.18222">.. index::
    pair: Markup; Tutorial
    
Simple text markup tells Leo how to create an external file from an
@clean node and its descendants. Let's look at a step-by-step example:

1. Create a new outline node whose headline is::

    @clean myfile.py

2. Type this in the body of the @clean node::
    
    @language python
    @tabwidth -4
    &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    @others
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

3. Create a child of the @clean node whose headline is::
   
   &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;

4. Type this in the child's body text::

        '''This is the docstring for the myfile module.'''
    
5. Create another child of the @clean node whose headline is::

        main
    
6. Type this in the body of the node::

        def main():
            print('hello from main')
        
7. Save the outline as myfile.leo. This creates myfile.py automatically.
   
8. Quit Leo.

9. Open myfile.py in your favorite text editor. You will see::

        '''This is the docstring for the myfile module.'''
        def main():
            print('hello from main')
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main()

Usually you will edit myfile.py from Leo, but Leo can update the outline
from changes you make in the text editor!

10. In your text editor, change the line::

        print('hello from main')
        
to::

        print('hello AGAIN from main')
        
11. Save myfile.py and quit your text editor.

12. Open myfile.leo. Leo reports that the 'main' node has been changed. It's body text is now::
    
        def main():
            print('hello AGAIN from main')
        
Automatic updates of @clean nodes is an important feature of Leo. We'll see
how this works later. But first, the next section discusses Leo's markup in
detail.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131004064408.16020">.. index::
   pair: Directive; Tutorial

**Directives** control Leo's operations. Directives start with ``@`` in the leftmost column.

Directives may appear either in headlines or body text.

When people speak of an ``@x`` node, they are implying that the headline starts with ``@x``. If a node contains an ``@x`` directive (in the body pane), they will usually say something like, "a node containing an ``@x`` directive".

Directives apply until overridden by the same (or related) directive in a descendant node.

Some commonly used general-purpose directives:

.. index::
    pair: @color; Tutorial
    pair: @nocolor; Tutorial
    pair: @killcolor; Tutorial

::

    @color
    @killcolor
    @nocolor

These control whether to syntax color text. 

Nodes may contain multiple color directives.

Nodes containing multiple color directives do not affect coloring of descendant nodes.
    
.. index::
    pair: @language; Tutorial

::

    @language python
    @language c
    @language rest # restructured text
    @language plain # plain text: no syntax coloring.
    
These control which language to use when syntax coloring text.

.. index::
    pair: @pagewidth; Tutorial
    
::

    @pagewidth 100
    
Sets the page width used when formatting paragraphs.

.. index::
    pair: @tabwidth; Tutorial
    pair: Negative tab width; Tutorial

::

    @tabwidth -4
    @tabwidth 8
    
Sets the width of tabs.

Negative tab widths cause Leo to convert tabs to spaces and are highly recommended for Python programming.

    pair: Clone; Tutorial
    
A **clone** is a node that appears in more than one place in a Leo outline. Clones are marked with a small red arrow in its icon box.

.. .. image:: images/box13.GIF
..    :scale 200 %
..    :alt: Leo Icon Box With Clone Mark

All clones of a node are actually *the same node*:

- Any change to one clone affects all clones.
- Inserting, moving or deleting any child of a clone will change all other clones on the screen.

Clones allow data to be stored in *arbitrarily many* places within an outline.

``Ctrl-` (clone-node)``
    Clones node A. The shortcut is a grave accent, *not* a single quote.  This is often on the same keyboard key as the tilda ``~`` character.

Please take a few moments to experiment with clones:

- Create a node whose headline is A.
- Clone node A with the ``clone-node`` command.
- Type some text into the body of A.
- All clones of A now have the same body.
- Insert a node, say B, as a child of any of the A nodes.
- Notice that *all* the A nodes now have a B child.
- See what happens if you clone B.
- See what happens if you insert, delete or move nodes that are children of A.
- When you delete a node's penultimate clone, the node becomes a regular node again.

<t tx="ekr.20131004191204.16079">Here are Leo's basic file commands:

``Ctrl-N (new)``
    Creates a new outline in a new tab.
``Ctrl-O (open-outline)``
    Opens an existing .leo file.
``Ctrl-S (save-file)``
    Saves the outline.
``Ctrl-Q (exit-leo)``
    Exits Leo.  Leo will prompt you to save any unsaved outlines.
    
A **session** specifies a list of tabs (.leo files) that Leo opens automatically when Leo first starts. When the ``--session-save`` and ``--session-restore`` command-line options are in effect, Leo will save session data on exit and will reload outlines when Leo restarts.

- Sections levels in the generated rST correspond to outline levels in Leo.

- You reorganize your rST documents just by reorganizing the corresponding @rst tree.
  
- The rst3 command works acts on the nearest ancestor @rst node, if any, or on all descendant @rst nodes.
  
- @rst-no-head nodes insert text (or markup) without an rST headline.

<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16053">A plugin is a Python file in Leo's plugins folder.

Every plugin should have a top-level init function that returns True if the plugin has been initialized properly. The init function typically:

1. Registers an onCreate event handler, called when Leo creates a new window.
2. Calls g.plugin_signon(__name__)

For example::

    def init():
        if &lt;&lt; all imports successful &gt;&gt;:
            g.registerHandler('after-create-leo-frame',onCreate)
            g.plugin_signon(__name__)
            return True
        else:
            return False
   
Plugins do *not* have automatic access to c, g and p.

Plugins define g by importing it::

    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g
    
Plugins gain access to c using event handlers::

    controllers = {}
    
    def init():
        g.registerHandler('after-create-leo-frame',onCreate)
        return True
        
    def onCreate (tag, keys):
        global controllers
        c = keys.get('c')
        if c:
            hash = c.hash()
            if hash not in controllers.keys():
                controllers(hash) = PluginController(c)
            
    def eventHander(tag,keys):
        global controllers
        c = keys.get('c')
        if c:
            controller = controllers.get(c.hash())
            controller.handleEvent()
            
Some plugins inject ivars into the Commands class rather than using a global controllers dict::

    def onCreate (tag, keys):
        c = keys.get('c')
        if c:
            c.my_plugin_controller = ControllerClass(c)
            
    def eventHander(tag,keys):
        c = keys.get('c')
        if c:
            c.my_plugin_controller.handleEvent()

Once c is determined, the presently selected position is simply c.p.

The @first directive forces lines to appear before the first sentinel of a
external file. For example::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python
    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Similarly, @last forces lines to appear after the last sentinel.

The @first and @last directives aren't necessary within @clean trees, but
they are allowed within @clean trees.

Rather than specifying long paths in @file nodes, you can specify a path in
an ancestor @path node.

For example, suppose three nodes have the following headlines::

    @path a
        @path b
            @file c/d.py

The @file node creates the file a/b/c/d.py

Within @path and @&lt;file&gt; paths, ``{{exp}}`` gets evaluated with c, g, p, os and sys predefined.  For example::

    @file {{os.path.abspath(os.curdir)}}/abc.py
</t>

    pair: @test Node; Tutorial

Leo's unit test commands (&lt;Alt-X&gt;run&lt;tab&gt; gives the full list) create unit tests from the body text of @test nodes.

- The headline gives the name of the test::

    @test test that g is predefined
    
- The body contains the unit test::

    assert g
    
- The unit test commands convert the body to a subclass of unittest.TestCase.  This saves a lot of typing.
  
- The unit test commands predefine c, g, and p as usual.

- 'self' is predefined as the test itself, that is, the instance of unittest.TestCase created by the @test node. For example::
  
    self.assertTrue(g)
    
For more details, see `Leo's unit-testing reference &lt;unitTesting.html&gt;`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16066">Clones are nodes appearing multiple places in the outline.

- Changes to one clone affect all other clones.
- All clones of a node are *exactly the same node*.

Views allow multiple views of data to exist in a single outline.

- A view is simply a collection of nodes.
- Because of clones, a node may appear in many views at once.
- View focus attention on tasks and reduce searching for nodes.

Leo expands abbreviations as you type.

- Abbreviations range from simple shortcuts to multi-line templates containing fields.
- Type ``,,`` to move to the next field.
- Abbreviations can also insert the result of executing code.

.. index:: Running Leo

This chapter tells how to run Leo and discusses Leo's command-line options.

.. contents::
    :depth: 3
    
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16151">You can run Leo from a Python interpreter as follows::

    import leo
    leo.run() # runs Leo, opening a new outline or,
    leo.run(fileName=aFileName) # runs Leo, opening the given file name.

Another way to run Leo is as follows::

    cd &lt;path-to-launchLeo.py&gt;
    python launchLeo.py %*

Here are some tips that may make running Leo easier:

**Linux**
    
The following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo::

    #!/bin/sh 
    python &lt;leopath&gt;launchLeo.py $1

where &lt;leopath&gt; is the path to the directory containing the leo directory. 

**Windows**

You can associate Leo with .leo files using a batch file. Put the
following .bat file in c:\\Windows::

    &lt;path-to-python&gt;/python &lt;path-to-leo&gt;/launchLeo.py %*

Here &lt;path-to-leo&gt; is the path to the directory *containing* the leo directory,
that is, the directory containing launchLeo.py.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16152">The first time you start Leo, a dialog will ask you for a unique identifier. If
you are using a source code control system such as git, use your git login name.
Otherwise your initials will do.

Leo stores this identifier in the file .leoID.txt. Leo attempts to create
leoID.txt in the .leo sub-directory of your home directory, then in Leo's config
directory, and finally in Leo's core directory. You can change this identifier
at any time by editing .leoID.txt.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16153" rst_http_attribute="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">On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form::

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.
Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of
that file using Leo's Execute Script command. By default, Leo sends all
output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable
this output by calling app.log.disable or app.log.enable

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body
and Edit Headline commands. Those commands require interaction with the user.
For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the
headlines in that file::

    path = r"&lt;path-to-folder-containing-the-leo-folder&gt;\\leo\\test\\test.leo"

    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

    for p in newFrame.c.all_positions():
        g.es(g.toEncodedString(p.h,"utf-8"))
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16154">Leo sends more detailed error messages to stderr,
the output stream that goes to the console window. In Linux and MacOS
environments, python programs normally execute with the console window visible.
On Windows, can run Leo with the console window visible by associating .leo
files with python.exe *not* pythonw.exe. 

.. For full instructions about how
.. to do this, see `Associating Leo with .leo Files`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16155">Python's HOME environment variable specifies Leo's HOME directory.
See http://docs.python.org/lib/os-procinfo.html for details.

Leo uses os.expanduser('~') to determine the HOME directory if no HOME environment variable exists.

Leo puts several files in your HOME/.leo directory:
.leoID.txt, .leoRecentFiles.txt, and myLeoSettings.leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16156">Leo supports the following command-line options. As usual, you can see the
list by typing the following in a console window::

    leo -h

or::

    leo --help

You will get something like the following::

    Usage: launchLeo.py [options]

Using Leo as a Personal Information Manager
###########################################

    "Cloning is pure genius!"---Michael Manti

    "If you are like me, you have a kind of knowledge base with infos
    gathered over time. And you have projects, where you use some of those
    infos. Now, with conventional outliners you begin to double these
    infos, because you want to have the infos needed for the project with
    your project. With Leo you can do this too, but if you change text in
    one place **it is updated in the other place too!** This is a feature I
    did not see with any other outliner (and I tried a few). Amazing! Leo
    directly supports the way I work!"---F. Geiger

This chapter tells how you can use Leo as a Personal Information Manager. It introduces `clones`_: one of Leo's most unusual and powerful features for organizing data.

    "I am a huge fan of Leo. I think it's quite possibly the most
    revolutionary programming tool I have ever used and it (along with the
    Python language) has utterly changed my view of programming (indeed of
    writing) forever."---Shakeeb Alireza
    
Leo's rst3 command converts Leo trees containing `reStructuredText`_ (rST) or `Sphinx`_ markup to HTML, PDF, `LaTeX`_ and other kinds of output files. This tutorial gives step-by-step instructions for using the rst3 command.

**Prerequisites**: Please make sure you have read the `first tutorial`_ before reading this one. If you are new to rST, please read the `rST primer`_. For full information about Sphinx, please read the `Sphinx documentation`_.

The rst3 command makes using rST or Sphinx *much* easier by automatically creating underlining for rST sections. To reorganize a document, just reorganize the corresponding Leo outline: you don't have to change underlining characters by hand.

The tutorial covers only the basic features of the rst3 command. This is enough to generate all of Leo's documentation!

CheatSheet.leo contains an expanded version of the example used in this tutorial. You can open CheatSheet.leo from Leo's help menu.

Programming with Leo
####################

    "We who use Leo know that it is a breakthrough tool and a whole new way
    of writing code."---Joe Orr

Now we come to the programming features that distinguish Leo from all other programming environments. Several kinds of nodes create external files. This tutorial discusses four of them: @clean, @file, @edit and @auto. @clean is recommended for most purposes.

Please study this section carefully if you intend to use Leo for programming. If you get stuck, please `ask for help &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leo-editor&gt;`_ immediately.

.. contents::
    :depth: 2
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16246">- @clean, @file, @edit and @auto trees create external files. @clean is recommended for most purposes.

- When writing @clean, @file and @auto trees, Leo replaces @others and section references with their expansions.
  
- A **section name** is any text of the form: ``&lt;&lt; any text &gt;&gt;``.

- A **section definition node** is a node whose headline starts with a section name.

- A **section reference** is a section name in body text.

- @edit reads an entire external file into the body text of the @edit node.

- @auto imports an external file into an outline, creating nodes for functions, methods and classes. @persistence nodes optionally save gnx's and uA's of @auto trees in a semi-permanent way.
  
- @first places lines before the first sentinel lines of a file.

- @path specifies a common prefix for file names of @clean, @file, @edit and @auto nodes.

- leo/core/LeoPyRef.leo contains all of Leo's core source code.

Exploring Leo's Code Base
#########################

.. |br| raw:: html

   &lt;br /&gt;
   
This chapter is for anyone who wants to understand Leo's code base,
including those who want to be one of Leo's implementors.

You already know that leoFind.py and leoUndo.py implement Leo's find and
undo command, and so on.

This chapter focuses on the *process* of finding your way around Leo's
code, not the myriad details you will find within Leo's code.

It's actually very easy! Try it. You'll see.

Reading this chapter should take about 20 minutes.

Leo highlights URLs whenever syntax is coloring is enabled.

``Ctrl-Left-Click (open-url-under-cursor)``
    Opens the URL under the cursor.
``open-url``
    Opens a URL appearing either in the headline or the first line of body text. If a headline starts with ``@url``, the rest of the headline is take to be a url.
    
**Note**:

- Leo opens URLs that look like file names using os.startfile.
- Leo opens all other URLs with your default web browser.
- Any scheme (http, mailto, ftp, file, etc.) supported by your browser is valid.
- URL's should contain no spaces: use ``%20`` instead of spaces.

`See the Appendix &lt;appendices.html#valid-url-s&gt;`_ for a complete description of valid URLs.

<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16748">.. index::
    pair: @rst Node; Tutorial
    
1. Create a node someplace in your outline.

2. Type this in the headline::

        @rst myDocument.html
        
The @rst node, and all its descendants, represents your document.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16750">Put something like this in the body of the @rst node::

    #############
    War and Peace
    #############
    
rST markup uses over/underlining to indicate chapter titles. Put a **overline** consisting of pounds signs above the title (War and Peace), and an identical **underline** of pound signs below as shown. rST markup for chapter titles is a bit picky:

- under/overlines must be at least 4 characters long
- under/overlines must be at least as long as the title.
- The overline and underline must be identical.

In addition, the rst3 command requires that the "#" character be used in the over/underlines for chapter titles.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16751">Now you write your novel, short story, documentation or whatever. Organize your work as always:

| **nodes create sections, subsections, sub-sub-sections, etc.**
| **depending on their position in the outline**.
</t>

    pair: rst3 Command; Tutorial

``&lt;Alt-X&gt;rst3&lt;Return&gt;`` runs the rst3 command.

- If the present node is an @rst node, or a descendant node of an @rst node, the rst3 command applies to the nearest ancestor @rst node.

- Otherwise, the rst3 command applies to all descendant @rst trees.

If @bool rst3_call_docutils is True, the rst3 command will call docutils automatically to create the output files. For more information about Leo settings, see `this section &lt;tutorial-basics.html#configuring-leo&gt;`_.

When using sphinx, run sphinx's "make" utility after running the rst3 command to create the final output files.

**Errors and warnings**:

1. Install docutils and then restart Leo if you see this error::

    writeToDocutils: docutils not present
    
2. ​Leo has a default stylesheet ​​that centers titles and makes them big and bold, so you can disregard messages such as::

    stylesheet not found &lt;path-to&gt;default.css
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16753">You now know enough to get started with the rst3 command. Some possible next steps are:

- Look at Leo's own documentation in LeoDocs.leo. Discover how the nodes in this tree correspond to the documentation you see before you.
   
- LeoDocs.leo has an @button make-sphinx script that calls sphinx automatically.

- Create your own @rst nodes. Run the rst3 command on them and see what happens. If you get stuck, please `ask for help &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leo-editor&gt;`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16754">Put the rst3_call_docutils setting in the @settings tree in the .leo file containing the @rst node. This setting determines whether to use plain rST markup or full sphinx markup. To use plain reStructuredText markup::

    @bool rst3_call_docutils = True
    
To use sphinx markup::

    @bool rst3_call_docutils = False
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16755">Sometimes you want to organize text without creating sections:

1. Create an outline node to organize your text.

2. Type the following in the headline::

    @rst-no-head &lt;any text: it is ignored&gt;
    
The rst3 command adds the body text of this node to the previous section:

- The headline is ignored.
- The @rst-no-head node does not change the rST section structure in any way.

    pair: Abbreviation; Tutorial

Leo optionally expands abbreviations as you type. Abbreviations typically end with something like ``;;`` so they won't trigger by accident.

You define abbreviations in ``@data abbreviations`` nodes or ``@data global-abbreviations`` nodes. None come predefined, but leoSettings.leo contains example abbreviations in the node ``@@data abbreviations examples``

Abbreviations can simply be shortcuts::

    ncn;;=@nocolor
    
Abbreviations can span multiple lines. Continued lines start with ``\\:``, like this::

    form;;=&lt;form action="main_submit" method="get" accept-charset="utf-8"&gt;
    \:&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Continue &amp;rarr;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    \:&lt;/form&gt;\n

Abbreviations can define templates in which ``&lt;\|a-field-name\|&gt;`` denotes a field to be filled in::

    input;;=&lt;input type="text/submit/hidden/button"
    \:name="&lt;|name|&gt;"
    \:value="" id="&lt;|id|&gt;"&gt;\n

Typing ``,,`` after inserting a template selects the next field.

Abbreviations can execute **abbreviation scripts**, delimited by ``{\|{ and }\|}``::

    date;;={|{import time ; x=time.asctime()}|}
    ts;;={|{import time ; x=time.strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")}|}
    
For example, typing ``ts;;`` gives::

    20131009171117
    
It's even possible to define a context in which abbreviation scripts execute. See leoSettings.leo for full details.

    pair: Plugins; Tutorial

`Leo plugins &lt;plugins.html&gt;`_ are Python programs that extend what Leo can do.

Plugins reside in the leo/plugins folder.

Enable plugins by adding their file names in ``@enabled-plugins`` nodes in an ``@settings`` tree. The ``@enabled-plugins`` node in leoSettings.leo enables the recommended plugins.

Programmers have contributed dozens of plugins, including:

- `bookmarks.py`_ manages and shows bookmarks.
- `contextmenu.py`_ shows a context menu when you right-click a headline.
- `mod_scripting.py`_ supports @button and @command nodes.
- `quicksearch.py`_ Adds Nav tab for searching.
- `todo.py`_ provides to-do list and simple project-management capabilities.
- `valuespace.py`_ adds outline-oriented spreadsheet capabilities.
- `viewrendered.py`_ creates the rendering pane and renders content in it.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.19039">Open bookmarks in a list, and show bookmarks in a pane.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.19040">Supports outline-based calculations similar to spreadsheets.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16815">The LoadManager (LM) class (in leoApp.py) is responsible for initing all objects and settings. This is a complex process. Here is the big picture:

- The LM reads each local (non-settings) file twice. The first load discovers the settings to be used in the second load. This ensures that proper settings are *available* during the second load.

- Ctors init settings "early", before calling the ctors for subsidiary objects. This ensures that proper settings are *in effect* for subsidiary ctors.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16860">In Leo, each class hides (encapsulates) the details of its internal workings from user (client) classes. This design principle has been spectacularly successful. Leo's overall design has remained remarkably stable for 20 years, even as the internal details of many classes have radically changed.

The distinction between gui-dependent and gui-independent is important. Almost all gui-dependent code resides in the plugins folder. Leo's core code is almost completely gui independent.

Leo's core typically assumes that w (an abstract widget) is a subclass of the baseTextWidget class. This class implements the DummyHighLevelInterface interface. Actually, w is usually a LeoQTextBrowser or leoQtBaseTextWidget object, defined in qtGui.py. These classes provide thin wrappers for corresponding Qt widgets.

Wrapper classes are useful, regardless of gui independence:

- Wrapper classes often simplify the corresponding code in Leo's code.
- Wrapper classes provide convenient methods for debugging and tracing.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16862">Once you know approximately where to look, it is easy to use traces to
discover what is going on. To trace the last n (default 4) callers of any
function::

    g.trace(g.callers(n))
    
Many complex methods define a trace variable::

    trace = False and not g.unitTesting
    
A good rule of thumb: the more complex a method is, the more useful its
traces are likely to be.

You can also to use g.pdb() to single-step through the code.
I typically use g.pdb() only for deep mysteries!

**Note**: you must run Leo from a console window to use either g.trace or
g.pdb. I recommend always running Leo from a console.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16866">Several modules contain long comments::

    &lt;&lt; about new sentinels &gt;&gt; (leoAtFile.py)
    &lt;&lt; about the leoBridge module &gt;&gt; (leoBridge.py)
    &lt;&lt; how to write a new importer &gt;&gt; (leoImport.py)
    &lt;&lt; How Leo implements unlimited undo &gt;&gt; (leoUndo.py)
    &lt;&lt; about gui classes and gui plugins &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; About handling events &gt;&gt; (leoFrame.py)
    &lt;&lt; Theory of operation of find/change &gt;&gt; (leoFind.py)
    &lt;&lt; Key bindings, an overview &gt;&gt; (leoKeys.py)
    &lt;&lt; about 'internal' bindings &gt;&gt; (leoKeys.py)
    &lt;&lt; about key dicts &gt;&gt; (leoKeys.py)
    
These comments may be helpful, but do *not* assume that they are accurate. When in doubt, trust the code, not the comments.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16868">You can learn *anything* about Leo, provided that you can cause Leo to execute the relevant code. That's usually very easy!

- It should be straightforward to isolate the module or modules involved.
- The next several sections give hints about finding interesting code.
- Once you find a bit of interesting code, use g.pdb or g.trace to study it.

The following sections provide more details...
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16870">The following methods and their helpers all have useful traces:

- leoQtEventFilter.eventFilter (qtGui.py) and helpers create keystrokes 
  (LeoKeyEvents) from QKeyEvent events.

- k.masterKeyHandler (leoKeys.py) receives LeoKeyEvents from eventFilter
  and invokes one of Leo's commands based on the users bindings.

- k.getArg handles commands like Ctrl-F (search-with-present-options)
  that prompt the user for input.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16871">c.outerUpdate and helpers eliminate flicker by redrawing the screen only at
the end of each command.

c.outerUpdate contains several sophisticated and useful traces.

qtGui.set_focus (qtGui.py) is the only place that actually explicitly sets
focus in Leo. Enabling a trace there can be useful.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16876">The following methods are surprisingly fragile. Change them only after careful thought. Make *sure* to run all unit tests after changing them in any way:

- leoTree.select and c.selectPosition switch nodes.

- c.endEditing ends editing in a headline and updates undo data.

- leoBody.onBodyChanged updates undo data when body text changes.

- baseNativeTree.onHeadChanged (baseNativeTree.py) updates undo data.

  **Note**: This method overrides leoTree.onHeadChanged (leoFrame.py),
  which is not used.

In addition, *all* event handling in baseNativeTree.py is extremely fragile. Don't even think about changing this code unless you know exactly what you are doing.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131012060912.16768">Leo creates commands in two ways:

1. Using the @g.command(command-name) decorator.

2. Using tables, usually getPublicCommands methods in various classes.

For example, to find the code for the sort-lines command, search for
sort-lines. You will find::

    'sort-lines':    self.sortLines,
    
Now search for "def sortLines" and you have arrived.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131012060912.16769">The following sections discuss topics that may not be apparent from reading
the sources.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131012060912.16770">Leo's key handling is complex because it does inherently complex things:

- Code in various places translate user key bindings to dictionaries.

- eventFilter and its helpers translates incoming QKeyEvents to LeoKeyEvents.

- k.masterKeyHandler associates incoming LeoKeyEvents with
  mode-and-pane-dependent bindings.
  
Much of this complexity is a direct result in the flexibility given to users in specifying key bindings.

    pair: Generator; Tutorial

Leo generators are `Python generators &lt;https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators&gt;`_. These generators traverse (step through) Leo outlines node by node: **Leo generators yield a sequence of positions.**

The Commands (commander) and position classes define several generators, discussed later in this chapter. c.all_positions() traverses the outline in outline order.  The following prints a properly-indented list of all headlines::

    for p in c.all_positions():
        print(' '*p.level()+p.h)
        
Leo generators **yield** (return a sequence of) positions. They do *not* return actual lists; this saves lots of space for large outlines. In fact, this "sequence of positions" is actually a sequence of a **single, constantly changing** position. This is a very important space optimization.
  
When a generator is finished, this single position becomes an **empty position**. p.v is None for empty positions. There are the right and wrong ways to test for empty positions::

    if not p:       # Right
    if not p.v:     # Right
    if p is None:   # Wrong!
    
The `scripting portion`_ of `Leo's cheat sheet`_ lists all of Leo's generators.

<t tx="ekr.20131012060912.16788">g.es can send it's output to tabs other than the log tab::

    c.frame.log.selectTab('Test')
        # Create Test or make it visible.

    g.es('Test',color='blue',tabName='Test')
        # Write to the test tab.

Plugins and scripts may call the c.frame.canvas.createCanvas method to create a log tab containing a graphics widget. Here is an example script::

    log = c.frame.log ; tag = 'my-canvas'
    w = log.canvasDict.get(tag)
    if not w:
        w = log.createCanvas(tag)

    pair: Hello World Example; Tutorial

Here is the obligatory "Hello World!" script::

    g.es('Hello World!')
    
In more detail:

1. Create a node anywhere in the outline.
2. Put g.es('hello, world!') in the node's body text.
3. Select the node and type Ctrl-B.

Notes:

- Output should appear in the log pane.
- ``Ctrl-B (execute-script)`` executes the body text of the selected node as a Python script.
- If text is selected, execute-script executes only the selected text.
- g.es prints its arguments to Leo's log pane.

    pair: Position; Tutorial
    pair: position class; Tutorial

A **position** represents a specific outline node at an exact location in the outline. Positions are instances of the position class, defined in leoNodes.py. Methods of the position class provide safe ways to insert, delete and move outline nodes. The `scripting portion`_ of `Leo's cheat sheet`_ lists the most important methods of the position class.

- The vnode at position p is p.v.

- Because all clones share the same vnode, many positions may have the same p.v field.

- p.b, p.h and p.u are synonyms for p.v.b, p.v.h and p.v.u.

- For any commander c, c.p is the presently selected node.

**positions usually become invalid when outline structure changes**. Scripts should store positions for later use only if the script does not cause the outline to change in any way.

- c.positionExists(p) returns True if p is (still) valid in c's outline.

The next section describes generators. Generators are a great way of gaining access to outline nodes.

    pair: Capturing Positions; Tutorial
    pair: p.copy(); Tutorial
    
As mentioned previously, **positions become invalid whenever nodes are inserted, deleted or moved**.

It is valid to capture positions *temporarily*, *provided* that the outline does not changed while the captured positions are being used. Here is the proper way::

    aList = [p.copy() for p in c.all_positions()]
        # aList is valid until the outline changes.
        
The p.copy() method returns a *separate* position that does not change when p changes. Beginners erroneously try to capture positions like this::

    aList = [p for p in c.all_positions()] # Wrong!
    
This is wrong. Leo's generators use a single position, and yield that *same* position for every node in the outline. Furthermore, that position will be empty when the generator ends, so every member of aList will be the (same) empty position!

    pair: Vnode; Tutorial
    pair: vnode class; Tutorial

This section discusses vnodes; the next discusses positions. To script Leo properly, you *must* understand how vnodes and positions are related.

**vnodes** are instances of the vnode class, defined in leoNodes.py. Each vnode represents *all* the data associated with an outline node, including *private* data carrying its outline structure. For each vnode v:

- v.b is the (outline) node's body text.

- v.h is the node's headline.

- v.u is the nodes **user data**, discussed later in this chapter.

| **All cloned outline nodes share a common vnode**. Conversely,
| each vnode represents *all* the clones of the corresponding outline node.

Because a *single* vnode can represent *many* outline nodes, it is awkward to use vnodes directly. This is where positions come in: **positions simplify access to vnodes**...

<t tx="ekr.20131014053720.16816">The .leo files in Leo's distribution contain many @button nodes (many disabled), that do repetitive chores. Here is one, @button promote-child-bodies, from LeoDocs.leo::

    # Great for creating what's new nodes.
    result = [p.b]
    b = c.undoer.beforeChangeNodeContents(p)

        else:

- c is a commander, g is the leoGlobals module, and p is the current position.
- Vnodes contain all outline data.
- Positions provide easy access to vnodes.
- Positions become invalid when outline nodes are inserted, deleted or moved.
- Generators visit all or parts of the outline, in a specified order.
- Generators yield a *single* position whose value constantly changes.
- p.copy() yields a new position that does not change when p changes.
- Alt-1 enables autocompletion.
- Leo's autocompleter understands symbols such as c, g, g.app, etc.
- @button nodes create scripts that can be applied to any outline node.
- @test nodes create unit tests (subclasses of unittest.TestCase) from body text.</t>

    "Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy."---Joe Orr

Leo is a fundamentally different way of using and organizing data, programs and scripts. Leo has been under active development for 15 years and has an active `group of developers and users`_.

You won't learn all about Leo in a day or two. `Leo's tutorial`_ explains the basic features. You can learn more advanced features later. Please `ask for help`_ immediately if you get stuck.

Leo has shamelessly stolen the best features of Emacs, including the minibuffer and many Emacs-like commands. But Leo goes *far* beyond other editors:

- Leo *completely integrates* Python scripting and outlines, not just the outline's data, but the outline structure as well.

- Features such as @test nodes and @button nodes can not even be *thought* in traditional editors. Leo implements such features easily; other editors could only simulate them--laboriously and unnaturally.
   
- Leo's outlines are based `Directed Acyclic Graphs`_. As a result, Leo can organize data in completely new ways.
  
These features combine to accelerate your work flow in a unique **Leonine** way, described more fully in `The Leonine World`_.
  
In the next sections, Leo's users tell, in their own words, why they think Leo is something truly special...
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131018100353.16706">Clones can greatly accelerate your work flow. To start a project, clone nodes related to the project and drag them at or near the top level, where you can get at them easily. When the project is complete, just delete the clones. This work flow is surprisingly effective:

- The original nodes never move, but they change whenever their clones do.

- There is nothing to "put back in place" when you are done. Just delete the clones.
  
Used this way, **clones create views**: when you gather cloned nodes together for a project, you are, in effect, creating a project-oriented view of the outline. This view **focuses your attention** on only those nodes that are relevant to the task at hand.
</t>

The Leonine World
#################

**Leonine** refers to Leo's unique way of organizing data and programs. This has many implications:

**Browsing**: Leo remembers your outline organization. Class browsers don't. Doh!

**The big picture**: Outline nodes hide messy details, revealing the big picture *at all times*.

**Programming**: Leo outlines naturally organize programs into modules, classes and functions. Leonine sources are their own design document. How you organize outlines is a choice in a new design space.

**User-defined types**: Headlines naturally describe a node's contents: **headlines naturally define types**. Leo's core supports types such as @button, @rst, @suite, @url, etc. Plugins define @bookmark, @graph, @html and @task types. Scripts can easily define other types.

**Testing**: Leo's @test nodes creates a unique unit-testing framework:

- @test nodes focus on the real test code.
- It is easy to run only the @test nodes in a particular suboutline.
- @test scripts can easily use data in their children.

**Work flow**: Clones accelerate your work flow by focusing your attention on the task at hand. Once you have gathered the relevant nodes, there is no need to keep searching for them. You can change the clones, and the original nodes change as well. This is a great way to fix bugs or to write books.

**Databases**: Leo's clones create new opportunities for scriptable databases. In my brother Speed's outlines, suboutlines *are* SQL queries!

<t tx="ekr.20131023151757.17124">"I would never again willingly program without Leo"---Edward K. Ream

From Terry Brown:

    If you're looking for an *environment* which includes a good editor and outliner and is completely scriptable / interactive / "live-code" in Python, then Leo wins hands down. Of course, it's basically alone in this field, as far as I know, but I'm sure it would do well even if it wasn't :-). Take out the Python part, and maybe they're some others out there, but who'd want to take out the Python part :) I guess Emacs is sort of an environment like this, only in Lisp with a prehistoric GUI system.

    Sometimes I've wondered why Leo seems to appeal to people who aren't comfortable in Python, I think now it's because they still recognize the value of an *environment*, and there's just not much in this niche.
    
    My feeling, talking generally and not about Leo in particular, is that while not everyone needs to be a "programmer", everyone who uses computers would benefit from being able to interact with them with more of the flexibility and efficiency that comes with even relatively simple "scripting", and less of the limitations that come with the "buy our latest product and you'll be able to do anything you want with a click" view pushed by other suppliers of computing environments.

From Jacob Peck:

    Leo's impact on my life since I found it in January has been substantial.

    Leo allows me to automate my life to a great extent. It is my to-do list, my personal assistant, my address book, my password log, my recipe archive, my rss feed reader (due to rss.py), and my favored editor. It partially powers my blog (along with git, ruby, and heroku), allowing me to create a new blog entry with one click and a bit of editing. Viewrendered (with markdown support!) has changed the way I write READMEs and blog posts. On top of all of that, it has allowed to me to organize several disparate tabletop game design projects I have going, as well as my numerous writing projects. Not to mention the impact it has on my ability to understand and decode large python projects!

    But what really cinches all of this for me is how crazy extensible Leo is. Script buttons in particular are an integral part of my daily workflow, allowing me to transform my productivity over the last month...I'm now a thing-getter-doner, and I find much of it is due to the powerful core of Leo, plus scripting.py and todo.py.
    
From Ville M. Vainio:
    
    The outliner format helps me organize/reorganize my thoughts gradually, instead of putting everything in the right place from the beginning. I write a lot of body text with few headlines, and Leo's approach leaves lots of space for the body text and therefore suits my workflow. I find that I end up revisiting notes composed on Leo more often than notes slapped into tools like Evernote or random files in the file system.

    With Leo, I can interleave "notes" (most of the content), generated files and even random data and python scripts to manipulate that data. I process this data in various tools, but Leo helps me group it together in "project specific" Leo files.

    I know how to script the outline, so I can easily whip up different tools for my needs that deal with the headline structure directly.
    
From Terry Brown:

    Why Leo? Because I have two nodes which were originally identical but are now different and I want to see the differences.
    
    My outline loads a @file called ~/.leo/t/gen which contains a @button with several @rclick children for commonly used tasks. I add a new one, @rclick diff::
    
        selected = c.getSelectedPositions()
        open('/tmp/a_diff', 'w').write(selected[0].b)
        open('/tmp/b_diff', 'w').write(selected[1].b)
        import os
        os.system("xxdiff /tmp/a_diff /tmp/b_diff &amp;")
    
    which is horrible for a number of reasons but also took only moments to write. And now, not only does this Leo session have a visual node diff capability, but also every future session which loads ~/.leo/t/gen.
    
    When you can go from wanting to having a feature in less time than it takes to write an email about it - well, that's "why Leo".

I still think the best way to do is to put examples. I was not able to
realize how to -clearly- say this until I read a recent post talking about
how tutorials are right now regarding the hello world, and how they should be.

That made me realize that that is exactly what I have being missing so far:
A step by step guide of the cool things Leo can do.

I wish I could get a step by step guide on how to transform an outline or a
subtree into a website html and open it. That is cool but I don't know how
to do that. How to post a node into a blog How to call and run an R file
from Leo Use RST properly

By step by step, I mean, literally, "write this in a new node" "write this
other thing in a sub-node" "Select the first node, then execute command..."

Heck, for pretty much any export file Leo can transform an outline into, I
would actually do something like that, in a "Leo quick examples" so within
a few examples and step-by-step guides as the ones mentioned, the users
will see how easy is to just write information once and have it as a
website, as a document, posted into a blog, etc.

Thanks to the new changes in the tutorial, now I clearly know how to find
strings, but it got me some months to be able to easily do something as
simple as that. But since the new tutorial explains that step by step (copy
this, insert text etc) as soon as I read that I could do that. There are
more Leo skills that don't come to mind but often find myself wandering
about when will I be able to do those, that is why I often ask for examples
on how do you guys use things, because without those, the new user has to
figure out how are the steps by himself without guides, and even though
they are very simple, you only know how simple those are after you see them
done, before, its just something you cant even imagine that is there.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131024051649.17136">Put introductory words in the body of the @rst node itself:

    "Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
    Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,
    if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
    Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more
    to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful
    slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have
    frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news."
    
    It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna
    Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna.
    With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank
    and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna
    Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering
    from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used
    only by the elite.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131024051649.17137">To create a new section, subsection, etc., in the output file:

1. Create a new outline node, as some descendant of the @rst node.

2. **The new node's headline becomes the section's title**.

3. Type the contents of the section in the body text of the node.

That's all there is to it:

- **The rst3 command generates rST underlining automatically**.

- **You reorganize your document by reorganizing nodes**.

There is *no* need to change markup when reorganizing your document, a huge improvement over writing "raw" rST.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131025044901.17143">Org mode is kinda like Leo for Emacs: http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html

As a result of "convergent evolution" it has many of Leo's features:

- Outline commands:
http://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-editing.html#Structure-editing

- To-do lists: http://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-Items.html#TODO-Items

- Hyperlinks: http://orgmode.org/manual/Hyperlinks.html#Hyperlinks

This is natural.

But org mode lacks *all* of Leo's crucial scripting features:

1. Org mode gives scripts *no* access to org mode outlines! There is no API, for elisp or any other language. No predefined c,g,p. In org mode, **everything is just text**.

2. Org mode has no extensibility features: no plugin architecture, no event handlers, no @button.

3. Org mode has no clones, generators, or positions because everything is a simple tree.

It is possible to create source files using org mode:
http://orgmode.org/manual/Working-With-Source-Code.html#Working-With-Source-Code

But org mode is feeble in comparison:

- No @others(!!)  noweb is used as the markup--there is *no* integration of markup with outline structure.
- Source code must be delimited with markup(!!)
  http://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-of-code-blocks.html#Structure-of-code-blocks
- No automatic tangling.
- No untangling at all.
- No automatic imports (@auto).

Emacs makes up for it's lack true outline structure with a huge user base,
so most (not all!) Leo's features have gotten *simulated* in an ugly,
hard-to-extend, way. But simulation has its limits: features like @button
and @test do not exist in org mode.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131025044901.17144">"Not sure why you said 'you can specify a computer program as an outline like thing in an outliner like setting.' Why not just say, 'write a computer program in an outline?' Is there some nuance I am missing?"---EKR

There are probably a million reasons I said it like that, but I think the main one is my ever present, brightly burning belief that a program should be designed before its coded. Remember those guys, back in the day, who after receiving their programming assignment, would go to the keyboard and start pounding out C code? Remember their finished product? Remember how long it took them to finally complete the project?

Meanwhile, when receiving an assignment, I'd spend hours to days with a bunch of paper, drawing diagrams. By the time I sat down at the terminal, I knew my data structures and algorithms. The hours to days head start of the "start coding immediately" guys evaporated because for me, coding was just a secretarial task, and I was required to do less refactoring, or even worse, kludging. Later, sometimes I'd substitute an outliner for the diagrams on paper; in the days of functional decomposition, an outliner was the perfect fit.

Back to your question: If all I needed to do was **write** a program, I'd just sit down at a computer and start pounding out C or Python or Lua or whatever. But that's not my style. I need to **design** a program, and after all, a design is just a specification of how the program is going to be written.

So it seems to me that I *design* the program on Leo, and then, when the time comes, I flip a switch and Leo *writes* the program for me. That's how I'd view what I've heard about Leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131025044901.17147">It is often useful to put reference material in your @rst tree that will *not* be included in the actual output. To have the rst3 command ignore a single node, type this in the node's headline::

    @rst-ignore &lt;ignored-text&gt;
    
Neither the headline nor body text will be part of the output file.
    
To have the rst3 command ignore a node and all its descendants, type this in the node's headline::

    @rst-ignore-tree &lt;ignored-text&gt;
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131025044901.17148">The `rST manual &lt;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#directives&gt;`_ tells how to insert "raw" markup into the output. For example, Leo's documentation defines the following::
    
    .. |---| unicode:: U+02015 .. for quotes
       :trim:

Now ``---`` inserts ---, the unicode "quotation dash" used to indicate the author of quotations. Note that rST automatically turns ``--`` into a dash: --.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131027064821.17131">Leo's read code parses text into true Python objects: Leo's positions and vnodes.

As a result, Leo scripts will be **orders of magnitude faster** than similar code in vim or emacs.

Leo scripts will also be **orders of magnitude simpler** than similar code in vim or emacs.

As a result, Leo has major subsystems, such as the rst3 command, that are virtually unthinkable
in text-oriented worlds such as vim or Emacs.  It would require emulating all of Leo's
fundamental, behind-the-scenes, data structures: generators, positions, and vnodes, including
the code that creates those data structures from both .leo files (xml readers and writers) 
and external files (code that creates vnodes from sentinel comments).

..  It would be easier in emacs, because elisp is more capable than the vim scripting language,
..  but neither elisp nor vimscript is anywhere near as easy to use as Python.

Emulating Leo in emacs or vim would have one advantage, it would not have to duplicate
the 15+ year process of improvement in Leo's read code (sentinels), data structures (vnodes)
and support code (generators).  But this would be a gigantic effort: to get the benefits of Leo
in either vim or Emacs the leoFileCommands, leoAtFileCommands and leoNodes modules would have to
be emulated.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131027064821.17144">The rst3 command applied to::

    @rst myDocument.html
    
will generate an **output file**, myDocument.html, from this node and its children, grand-children, etc. The rst3 command creates the output file in the same directory as the .leo file containing the @rst node. You can specify other directories using absolute or relative paths. Examples::

    @rst myDocument.html        # in same folder as the .leo file
    @rst html/myDocument.html   # in a subfolder
    @rst ~/docs/myDocument.html # an absolute path to the folder
    
The rst3 command writes an **intermediate file** in the same directory as the output file. This intermediate file contains the reStructuredText markup generated by the rst3 command. It has the suffix .txt::

    myDocument.html.txt


</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131027064821.18685"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20131027064821.18689">When using sphinx you must ensure that sphinx's conf.py file is configured so that it will find the intermediate files created by the rst3 command. For example, the conf.py file for Leo's docs contains the following::

    source_suffix = '.html.txt'
    
This "matches" the form of the intermediate files.  For example, given::

    @rst myDocument.html
    
and the default value for the rst3_write_intermediate_extension setting::

    @string rst3_write_intermediate_extension = .txt
    
the name of intermediate file will be::

    myDocument.html.txt

myDocument.html.txt is the **input** file for sphinx.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131028213522.17137">Samples of use (Maybe):

    Sample on how to import bookmarks from Internet browser (I have that
    script ready myself, I could add that)

    Sample of website generated with an outline, easy to open and edit for
    the user to view its power. Ideally, just after transforming the
    outline to website, the user should be able to open it and see it in
    html.

    Sample of RST outline and one click opening with render pane.

    The RPG helper we recently discussed about.

    And as many other practical and ready-to-go samples that could impress
    the new user. All of them, ready to go, no edit required to view. There
    are ways of using Leo that beginners can't think of and those would make
    a great addon for such a beginner's leo file.

Use .leo files to test settings rather than to contain data. These files would typically contain just an @settings tree, and one or two nodes illustrating their effect. Opening such files limits the effects of experimental/non-standard/risky settings. This is a great tip to know.

For example, the files leo10pt.leo, leo12pt.leo, leo14-12pt.leo and leo14pt.leo in the leo/config folder make it easy to compare different font settings.

As another example, when starting the vim-mode project I created a .leo file containing @bool vim-mode = True. By opening this file I test vim mode without interfering with my normal work flow.

<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16401">Making screencasts is a lot easier than you probably think. Here are some tips to get you started quickly.







</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16402">The primary purpose of this script is to open your app at a fixed, unchanging size. This is surprisingly important:

- It ensures that the window will always render to pixels in the same way.
- It makes it easier to splice in new video to an existing video.
- It makes it easier to plan your video to ensure everything will appear as you expect.
- It provides continuity when making a series of videos.

Here is a script that I use when making Leo's screencasts::

    python27 launchLeo.py --no-cache --gui=qttabs
    --window-size=682x1264 &lt;list of .leo files&gt; %*​
    
This *particular* --window-size causes Camtasia to create a window whose actual size is 720x1280, the nominal 720p resolution. It may prevent text blur. Or not. I do know that Leo's screencasts look great at 720p.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16403">Make sure that you can actually upload *excellent quality* videos before doing anything else. This step is crucial. If you skip this step, all of your initial recording an post-production work could be utterly wasted.

Use *short* (10-second) test videos at this step. Their primary purpose verify that you can can get to the *end* of the production process successfully. You *are* going to make lots of mistakes here: using short videos helps you make these mistakes quickly.

Don't even *think* about making longer videos until the answers to all the following questions are clearly "yes":

- Is your camera working?
- Is your microphone working?
- Do you know how to record your voice and screen?
- Can you log into YouTube or screencast.com?
- Can you upload to YouTube or screencast.com?
- Is the sound in your *uploaded* video great?
- Do the pixels in your *uploaded* look great?

This last item is particularly important. Just because pixels look good in your video editor is no guarantee that they will look good when uploaded.

You are ready to try your first "real" take *only* when you can upload a video that looks and sounds great.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16404">Before rushing right out and making your first video, I recommend watching the tutorial screencasts at screencast.com: http://www.techsmith.com/tutorial-camtasia-8.html

Watch the tutorials to see how the presentations themselves are organized. Watch them until it feels natural to emulate their style.

If you will be using Camtasia, you will also want to watch the tutorials to learn how Camtasia works.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16405">Now it's time to go beyond test videos. Even now, though, I recommend keeping your first efforts short: one minute or so. Again, this saves time. You'll ending up throwing away two or three anyway ;-)

Bring up your app using you demo script and run through your presentation.

Here's the **most important tip**: As you narrate your video, audio flubs are inevitable, but they don't matter at all *provided* that you *realize* that you have just flubbed a word or phrase.

When you flub a line, don't panic! Just *pause*, regroup, and repeat the phrase until you get it right. *Pausing is essential*: it simplifies inserting and deleting sound bites during post production.

You'll relax once you realize that flubs don't matter and that pausing makes post-production easier. Once you relax, getting a good take will suddenly become easier.

Correcting flubs *as soon as they happen* is absolutely essential. Don't even *think* about fixing audio flubs in post-production. It simply can't be done. Instead of spending 20 minutes trying (and failing) to correct a flub in post production, it is much faster and better to take 20 seconds during your take to correct the flub.

Similar remarks apply to video, but in my experience it's much easier to get the video right. If you do flub the video, it will be much easier if you just do a complete retake. With Camtasia, you can separate the audio and video tracks, but usually that won't work, especially if there is audio of key clicks.

By retaking audio flubs as they happen, I find it easy to work without a script. It feels more natural to me than reading a script. YMMV. When I get stuck, I just pause. Or just start over. Otoh, it wouldn't be that hard to read a script. Just *pause* before and after each phrase. Never rush your audio!

In short, the key Aha is: insert (audio) pauses *everywhere* as needed. It's easy to edit them out. It's virtually impossible to edit in the middle of words, even with the world's best audio editor.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16406">Post production should be easy provided that you have corrected all audio flubs as they happen. This keeps the audio and video in sync. Just edit out flubs and reduce overly-long pauses.

I won't discuss production details here because they depend on the editor you are using.

Do a new take if you don't have clean audio. Depending on the complexity of your video, it may be possible to splice a partial take in the middle or end of your video. Similarly, it may be possible to splice in a new take to add material you didn't cover in your first take.

One final word of advice. When editing your video, settle for "good enough". Perfectionism is not your friend.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16407">Making a screencast is a lot easier than you think :-)

- Create a script that will open your app at a fixed, optimal, size.

- Emulate the style and form of screencast.com tutorials.

- Verify the *entire* production process with short test videos.

  Before making longer videos, make *sure* that the test videos look and sound great *when they have been uploaded*.
  
- When doing a take, flubs don't matter, *provided* you correct them *during the take*.  Use pauses.  Make haste slowly!

- Splice in new takes during post-production to fix flubs and add new material.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131129061821.16884">Here are some more tips I've learned from experience:

1. Redo audio tests and video tests every time you start a new session. It's amazing how hum can creep into recordings.

2. The most important step in post production is to get the pacing so it feels right. Beware of editing out pauses. Make sure you give your viewers time to see what you are doing, and to see what you have done.
   
3. Don't waste time on callouts or captions until the audio and video work together at a relaxed pace. It's almost as hard to correct pacing mistakes as it is to correct audio flubs.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131211054925.16388">1. Enable volume leveling and noise removal in Camtasia. This tip, all by itself, makes a big difference.

2. Use a better microphone, preferably one with about a 1-inch diaphragm. This is the kind of microphone that Andrew Price uses. The Audio-technica AT2020 USB is relatively inexpensive.
  
3. Use "pop filter" with the microphone. This is a cloth or (better) a metal screen that is placed in front of the microphone. It smooths the sound.
  
4. Adjust the sound level for maximum volume without distortion: With the microphone about a foot from your mouth, turn the volume as loud as possible, then turn down until no red is visible in the meter.

<t tx="ekr.20131215083347.16902">Any Leo node may contain a Python script.

``Ctrl-B (execute-script)`` executes the body text of the presently selected node.

| execute-script creates the script using @others and section references:
| **you can create complex scripts from a node and its descendants.**

| As discussed below, execute-script predefines three variables: c, g and p.
| Using these variables, scripts may easily do any of the following:

- Gain access to all data contained in any Leo outline.
- Traverse the data in any outline.
- Use utility classes and function in the leo.core.leoGlobals module.
- Execute any code in Leo's own code base.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131215083347.16903">.. tutorial-programming.html

.. index::
    pair: @clean; Tutorial

Leo (5.1 and above) creates **external files** (files on your file system) from **@clean nodes** and their *descendant* nodes. Examples::

    @clean spam.py
    @clean ../foo.c
    @clean ~/bar.py

A single Leo outline may contain many @clean nodes. Leo outlines are like project files in other IDE's (Integrated Development Environments).

.. index::
    pair: Import Script; Tutorial
    pair: import-file command; Tutorial

Leo's import-file command creates a single @clean tree using the same imports that @auto uses. When importing several files it is more convenient to use a **import script**. Leo's `Scripting Tutorial &lt;tutorial-scripting.html&gt;`_ discusses such scripts.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140216125129.16666"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20140720203932.17747">Leo can automatically import and export Emacs org-mode (.org) files. Nodes like::

    @auto-org-mode &lt;path to .org file&gt;

or equivalently::

    @auto-org &lt;path to .org file&gt;
    
import the org-mode file as a Leo outline. 

These nodes work like other @auto nodes: when Leo loads an outline, Leo reads the .org file into the @auto-org-mode tree. When Leo writes an outline, Leo writes any @auto-org-mode tree back to the org-mode file.

After creating an @auto-org-mode node by hand, be sure to use Leo's refresh-from-disk command to populate the node. Do this *before* saving the .leo file. If you try to save an empty @auto-org-mode node Leo will warn you that you are about to overwrite the file.

The ``refresh-from-disk`` command creates an @auto-org-mode node whose **children** represent the contents of the external .org file. Leo does *not* write the @auto-org-mode node itself. This allows you to put Leo directives in the node.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140720203932.17748">Leo can automatically import and export vimoutline (.otl) files. Nodes like::

    @auto-otl &lt;path to .otl file&gt;

or equivalently::

    @auto-vimoutline &lt;path to .otl file&gt;
    
import the .otl as a Leo outline.

These nodes work like other @auto nodes: when Leo loads an outline, Leo reads the .otl file into the @auto-otl tree. When Leo writes an outline, Leo writes any @auto-otl tree back to the .otl file.

After creating an @auto-otl node by hand, be sure to use Leo's refresh-from-disk command to populate the node. Do this *before* saving the .leo file. If you try to save an empty @auto-otl node Leo will warn you that you are about to overwrite the file.

The refresh-from-disk command creates an @auto-otl node whose **children** represent the contents of the external .otl file. Leo does *not* write the @auto-otl node itself. This allows you to put Leo directives in the node.

<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18216"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18217">Leo's vim mode dispatches keystrokes sent to it from k.masterKeyHandler to **key handlers**.

Each key handler handles the incoming key and then calls either vc.accept(), vc.done(), vc.ignore() or vc.quit(). These methods tell k.masterKeyHandler whether vim-mode has completely handled the key. If so, k.masterKeyHandler simply returns. Otherwise, k.masterKeyHandler handles the key as usual.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18218">Key handlers handle a single key during the parsing of a vim command. Key handlers can either complete a command, thereby actually doing something, or change state so as to be able to parse (and possibly complete) the next incoming keystroke.

For example, the key handler for the G command handles the command completely. In contrast, two key handlers are needed to handle the gg command. The first handler, vc.vim_g, simply calls vc.accept(handler=vc.vim_g2). This call changes the vc.handler ivar to point to the **follow-on handler**, vim_g2. vim_g2 handles all commands after the user has typed 'g' in normal mode.

Each key handler must end with a call to an **acceptance method**. vc.accept is one such method. Acceptance methods prepare for the next keystroke by setting internal state ivars used by the various dispatchers.

Many key handlers simply call vc.done(). This method handles all the details of completing a key handler: it hides the details of parsing vim command.

**Important**: Any key handler that wants to change vc.state should set vc.state *before* calling vc.done()

Key handlers can call either **direct acceptance methods**, vc.accept, vc.delegate, vc.done, vc.ignore, vc.not_ready, vc.quit, and vc.reset, or **indirect acceptance methods**: vc.begin_insert_mode, vc.begin_motion, vc.end_insert_mode, and vc.vim_digits. Indirect acceptance methods must eventually call direct acceptance methods.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18219">Dispatchers set the following ivars for each key handler:

**vc.w** is the widget that has focus. Key handlers may use convenience methods to determine the location and type of vc.w. The most important are:

- vc.is_text_widget(w): True if w is any text widget, including headlines, body text and log pane.
  
- vc.in_headline(w): True if w is a headline widget in edit mode.

**vc.stroke** is a standard Leo stroke representing the incoming key. Note that the spelling of the stoke using the Tk spellings. Take a look at entries in the dispatch dicts to see such spellings. When in doubt, enable the trace in vc.do_key to see the incoming strokes.

**vc.n1** and **vc.n** are the repeat counts in effect for each key handler. Dispatchers and their allies handle most details of setting these repeat counts, so most key handlers can simply use vc.n1*vc.n as the ultimate repeat count.

**vc.motion_i** is the insertion point *before* the motion has taken place.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18220">The simplest way of moving the cursor or changing text is to use the vc.do method, a thin wrapper for c.k.simulateCommand.  For example::

    if vc.state == 'visual':
        vc.do('end-of-buffer-extend-selection')
    else:
        vc.do('end-of-buffer')

Key handlers may also use the **high-level interface**. This is the API used throughout Leo's core. For details, see the HighLevelInterface class in leoFrame.py and various subclasses in qtGui.py.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18221">The vc.vim_d method and its follow-on methods handle vim's d commands.

The vc.vis_d method handles the d keystroke that ends visual mode.

The following sections examine each piece of the code in detail. If you understand how it works you should know everything you need to write any other key handler.

    def vim_d(vc):
        '''

        '''
        if vc.is_text_widget(vc.w):
            vc.n = 1
            vc.accept(handler=vc.vim_d2)
        else:
            vc.quit()
@language rest

This is the key handler for the 'd' key in normal mode.

The entry in vc.normal_dispatch_d for 'd' is: 'd':vc.vim_d.

Because this command changes text, vc.is_text_widget(vc.w) must be True. If
so, this handler simply calls vc.accept(handler=vc.vim_d2) to queue up the
follow-on handler. Otherwise, the handler calls vc.quit() to end the
command.

                vc.done()
            else:
                vc.d_stroke = vc.stroke # A scratch var.
                vc.begin_motion(vc.vim_d3)
        else:
            vc.quit()
@language rest

This is the follow-on handler for the 'd' command. It will be called when
the user types a *second* character following the 'd' command in normal
mode.

All forms of the 'd' command alter text, so this handler calls vc.quit if
vc.w is not a text widget.

If the second character is another 'd', we have the 'dd' command. The code
uses the high-level interface to delete a line, then calls vc.done() to end
the command.

If the second character is *not* a 'd', it should be a following motion,
such as "2j" in "d2j".

vc.vim_d2 remembers the character that started the motion in a **scratch
ivar**, vc.d_stroke. Such ivars are not inited or touched outside of vim_d
and its follow-on key handlers. This code must remember this character so
that the vim_d3 handler will know whether to expand the deleted text to a
line.

Finally, vc.vim_d2 calls vc.begin_motion, which does the following:

- Calls vc.ignore if the second character doesn't really start a motion.
- Sets vc.handler to vc.do_inner_motion.  This handles the motion.
- Sets the vc.after_motion to the next follow-on handler: vc.vim_d3.
  vc.vim_d3 will be called when the motion is complete. The details are
  complicated, but happily the key handlers don't have to know about them!

This is the second and last follow-on handler for the d command. The
dispatcher that handles vim motions will call this handler after the
motions **have actually happened**.

First, the code double-checks that we are still in a text widget, calling
vc.quit() if not.

Next, the code compares the present insertion point, w,getInsertPoint(),
with the insertion point before the motion happened, vc.motion_i. It
extends the selection range if the scratch ivar, vc.d_stroke, is in ('jk').
The code then deletes the selected text.

Finally, this method calls vc.done().

This is the key handler for the 'd' key in normal mode.

It is *not* a follow-on method of vim_d. The dispatcher calls this method
after visual mode has highlighted text. Here is the entry for 'd' in
vc.visual_dispatch_d: 'd':vc.vis_d.

Visual mode has already highlighted the text to be deleted, so this code
simply deletes the highlighted text and calls vc.done().

<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18226">The VimCommands class in leoVim.py implements Leo's vim mode. Vim mode is active only if @bool vim-mode = True.

The following sections will be of interest only to those seeking a deep knowledge of how vim mode's dispatchers work. Such knowledge should rarely be required because dispatchers and key handlers are completely unaware of each other. Dispatch dicts and acceptance methods shield dispatchers and key handlers of all knowledge of each other. In particular, acceptance methods handle the sometimes tricky details of ending a key handler.

Leo's vim code is spectacularly different from the real vim's code. Wherever possible, Leo uses methods to hide implementation details.

Ironically, now that everything is hard coded in tables, it would be easy for plugins to customize the workings of vim-mode.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18227">The init code for each Leo commander c assigns an instance of VimCommands to c.vimCommands. This is done regardless of the @bool vim-mode setting.

Each ivar of the VimCommands class is inited by exactly one of the following::

    vc.init_constant_ivars()
    vc.init_dot_ivars()
    vc.init_persistent_ivars()
    vc.init_state_ivars()
    vc.create_dispatch_dicts()
    
In effect, this code partitions each ivar into disjoint sets. This partitioning simplifies code that must re-init some ivars but not others.

The init code creates **dispatch dicts** used by dispatchers.  
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18228">Depending on various state date, dispatchers route incoming keys to the proper **key handler**. Dispatchers use **dispatch dicts** to assign handlers to incoming keys. These dicts eliminate almost all special case code.
   
vc.do_key is the top-level dispatcher. k.masterKeyHandler calls it for all keys *except* Ctrl-G. **Note**: k.masterKeyHandler calls vc.do_key only when there no key state in effect, that is, when the minibuffer is not active.

As discussed below, the value returned by vc.do_key tells k.masterKeyHandler whether vim mode has completely handled the key.

Depending on the vc.handler ivar, vc.do_key can route the incoming key either to an **inner dispatcher** or directly to a key handler.

Inner dispatchers handle keys for a particular vim mode using dispatch dicts. Inner dispatchers the following ivars behind the scenes::

    vc.handler, vc.next_func, vc.return_value
    vc.in_motion and vc.motion_func
    
Handling these ivars can be tricky; hiding the details greatly simplifies all key handlers.

<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18229">vc.do_key returns the value of vc.return_value. Most the acceptance functions set vc.return_value to True, indicating that vim mode has completely handled the key and that k.masterKeyHandler should simply return. k.masterKeyHandler handles the key as usual if vc.do_key returns False.

Each key handler sets vc.return_value indirectly by calling an acceptance method. A simple check in vc.do_key ensures that every key handler, has, in fact, called an acceptance method. In practice, this check has been very effective.

- The gb,ge,gh commands are synonyms for 0,$,^.
- The h,j,k,l commands work on outlines when entered in the outline pane.
- 0 in outline pane: goto-first-visible-node
- e in outline pane: goto-last-visible-node.
- Deleting text: d{motion},{motion}d,v{motion}d,diw,x.
- Insert commands: a,A,i,o,O and switch to insert mode if entered in the outline pane.
- Yank &amp; paste commands: y,p. These act on outlines if entered in the outline pane.
- Search commands: /,?,n,*,#.  These commands are node-only searches.
- The dot command '.' works for motions, but not yet for inserts or searches.
- v: start/end visual mode.

Notes:

- Except as noted above, all vim-mode commands must be entered in the body pane.
- &lt;Return&gt; in headlines switches to the outline pane.
- &lt;Return&gt; in the outline pane switches to the body pane.

The handler for the G command moves or extends the cursor depending on vc.state.

@language python
::

    def vim_G(vc):
        '''Put the cursor on the last character of the body pane.'''
        if vc.is_text_widget(vc.w):
            if vc.state == 'visual':
                vc.do('end-of-buffer-extend-selection')

        else:
            vc.quit()
            
@language rest

On entry, the dispatcher has set vc.w to the widget with focus. First, the code ensures that this widget is a text widget. If so, the code uses the vc.do method, a thin wrapper for c.k.simulateCommand, to execute Leo commands by name.

zero-length, and it automatically removes surrounding whitespace
(calling .strip()).

<t tx="ekr.20141105085003.12">I like to use reStructuredText (reST) for all of my note-taking, idea
development, project and task management and automation of desktop
activities (e.g. initiating a backup). You could say it is the control
center of my daily activities, including calculating and showing dashboards
of where I am and where I'm going.

This means I need a tool which seamlessly shows me the full-fidelity
browser-rendered version of what I am writing and be able to print my notes
for meetings, cut and paste nicely formatted output to my office e-mails
and documents, as well as show some of the material as a slideshow.

The existing *viewrendered* plugin couldn't seem to do what I needed
(especially math) and I was almost ready to abandon Leo again. This time I
bit the bullet and created a more capable renderer in viewrendered2 (VR2).
Initially I made a plugin that rendered, on demand, to my normal web
browser. This worked well, but I really thought live rendering like
"viewrendered" would be better, and for that I needed close control over
scroll positions etc. that I couldn't get with an external browser. So the
plugin became much more complex as I merged it with the existing
viewrendered plugin, but was ultimately more powerful and useful to me.

      s5 slideshows
      javascript
      svg images
      configurable css

* Allow showing of node tree rather than just the current node. This can
  give a better overview perspective of the tree contents.

* Be able to lock the rendering on the root node of a tree, to view the
  effect editing a sub-node within the larger html document.

* Provide proper rendering of any combination of node types in a tree, so long as
  they have been properly designated by @language directives (i.e. reST, text,
  code, css, ...).

* Allow viewing (and printing) of an entire source file from an @file type
  root node.

* Be able to *export* any of these renderings to a full web-browser to take advantage
  of the large rendering window (especially for slideshows, as well as printing, saving output.
  
* Be able to integrate automatically executed code nodes intermingled with
  reST nodes to provide an automatic calculation-based "Notebook" or "Report"
  type output.

* Don't increase the dependencies of Leo.

<t tx="ekr.20141105085003.14">VR2 is implemented mostly as an ~600 line expansion of the update_rst
method in the viewrendered.py plugin. The text-oriented class used for
rendering in VR1 has been replaced by the QWebView class which provides the
full rendering functionality of a real web-browser. To make this flexible,
a toolbar has been attached to the top with a few controls.

Because I wanted to retain compatibility with VR1, I created the
viewrendered2.py plugin, but retained all the class naming which occurred
within VR1. This means that it remains compatible with the existing
mechanisms (like free_layout) of showing and creating panes for VR1. I
tried this with an expectation that it would fail, but it appears to work
without any unintended side-effects.

Tooltips have been added where Qt allows, with the philosophy that a user
shouldn't need a manual to use this pane.

VR2 has been used a lot under Windows 7 and a little under Ubuntu 13.10.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20141105085003.15">I use VR2 every few minutes every working day. However, VR2 is likely to
still have a lot of rough edges and, in particular, bugs that show up with
different work flows or css folder layouts etc. In fact, VR2 is still a
work in progress and therefore still being fiddled with, so bugs creep in
regularly.

But overall, my perception of its deficiencies are:

* Does not handle reST headings within the node bodies well (sometimes very
  slow render, blocking Leo).

* VR2 attempts to reconcile reST headings that originate from explicit
  headings within the nodes against reST headings that are
  automatically generated by the node hierarchy. In many cases, this
  is impossible, resulting in many errors which drastically slows down
  rendering. - Recommend not using headings within the nodes
  themselves, leaving the node hierarchy to do this automatically.

* If the node triggers one of the special viewrendered node header types
  (@md, @image, @movie, @html) VR2 simply defaults to the old handlers for
  those types. This means it jumps back to whatever pane type VR1 uses, so
  the features of VR2 disappear. I suspect that VR2 could incorporate these
  types into the new version and retain these new features. I should look
  at that.
    
* Doesn't integrate with rst3 plugin, especially honouring @others etc.
  There are some conflicts in objectives, so this may never be fully
  resolved. It would probably make sense for rst3 settings to get used for
  VR2 as well, along with additional VR2 specific settings. Currently, VR2
  has its own @settings-style settings. The rst3 code is not used.
  
* For slideshow purposes, a patch to docutils s5_writer is required to be
  able to handle an arbitrary hierarchy of nodes (forces all headings to
  start a new slide). Otherwise, only the 2nd level nodes (from the root)
  force a new slide.
  
* The integration of VR2 code into the existing viewrendered plugin code is
  rudimentary. I took the shortcut of not trying to understand this code
  well and confining my integration to the rst rendering only. Better
  integration would be a good future step.

With the plugin being able to execute javascript etc. there may be some
form of security issue, but I can't see it myself (given that Leo can
execute arbitrary python code anyway).

        # outline, automatically updated to be consistent

a set.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20141105085003.8">The "Tags" tab in the Log pane is the UI for this plugin.  The bar at
the top is a search bar, editable to allow complex search queries.  It
is pre-populated with all existing tags in the outline, and remembers
your custom searches within the given session.  It also acts double duty
as an input box for the add (+) button, which adds the contents of the
search bar as a tag to the currently selected node.

The list box in the middle is a list of headlines of nodes which contain
the tag(s) defined by the current search string.  These are clickable,
and doing so will center the focus in the outline pane on the selected node.

Below the list box is a dynamic display of tags on the currently
selected node.  Left-clicking on any of these will populate the search
bar with that tag, allowing you to explore similarly tagged nodes.
Right-clicking on a tag will remove it from the currently selected node.

The status line at the bottom is purely informational.

The tag browser has set-algebra querying possible.  Users may search for
strings like 'foo&amp;bar', to get nodes with both tags foo and bar, or
'foo|bar' to get nodes with either or both.  Set difference (-) and
symmetric set difference (^) are supported as well.  These queries are
left-associative, meaning they are read from left to right, with no
other precedence.  Parentheses are not supported. See below for more
details.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20141108064630.10">Leo makes it easy to create and run unit tests from individual outline nodes or trees. A node whose headline starts with @test defines a unit test. The body text of the @test node contains a **self-contained** unit test. For example, this creates a complete unit test::

    @test fails  (headline)
    assert False (body text)

To run this test, select the @test node and do::

    &lt;alt-x&gt;run-selected-unit-tests-locally.

Leo will create and run the unit test automatically.

To see all of Leo's unit testing commands, do::

    &lt;alt-x&gt;run&lt;tab&gt;

Leo pre-defines 'c', 'g' and 'p' in unit tests just as in scripts.

For more details about unit testing, see: http://leoeditor.com/unitTesting.html

**Notes for Leo developers**

leo/test/unitTest.leo contains all of Leo's own unit tests.

Running all tests is not necessary.  Just select::

    Active Unit Tests

and then do Alt-4 (run-selected-unit-tests-locally).

**Note**: Some tests will likely fail on machines other than EKR's. You only need to be concerned about unit tests that start failing after you make your changes.

File under things-I-didn't-know-but-should-have:

Instead of creating batch files all over the place to fire up python programs, and then having to cope with annoying "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?" with Ctrl-C/Break you can ask python setuptools to create an .exe in the Python\Scripts folder.

in same folder as foo.py create setup.py, populate like so::

@language python

    from setuptools import setup
    
    setup(
        name='Foo for you',
        version='0.3',
        py_modules=['foo'],
        entry_points='''
            [console_scripts]
            foo = foo
            '''
        )
    
@language rest

Then run "pip --editable install . " in the same folder. Foo.exe will be created in C:\pythonxx\Scripts. As long as that folder is in path you can use foo like any other command line program. Furthermore the "editable" parameter means we can continue to edit and change foo.py and the changes are always live.

Yeah! No more "pushd ..\path\to\data\folder &amp;&amp; python ..\path\to\code\foo.py
--do-stuff-here ..." for me. :)

Works for Leo too -- with the existing setup.py. It creates leo.exe and leoc.exe for Windowed mode (no log messages to console) and console mode respectively.

I don't get the difference when I have to call them using g.Functionname(), c.functionname(), or when those wont do.

How can I call the function "insertIconFromFile"? How can I know how to call functions found in LeoPyRef.leo?

-----

Ok, in order to print icons, the code is this::

    c.editCommands.insertIconFromFile(path)

I'm quoting from this Leo manual
http://leoeditor.com/scripting.html#important-objects,
http://leoeditor.com/scripting.html#inserting-and-deleting-icons

Although I still have a mess on which functions can be called how, and where to find the list of classes that can be called such as "editCommands" and the rest that they might exist. Thanks!

I suppose you could say that there is no general solution, but the situation isn't really all that difficult.

Start with c. We know what that is: it is a commander object representing an open outline.

There are **official ivars** of c, all referring to wrapper classes defined in leoFrame.py::

    c.frame         an instance of leoFrame.
    c.frame.tree    an instance of  leoTree.
    c.frame.body    an instance of leoBody.
    c.frame.log     an instance of leoLog.

The tree, body and log objects have a *wrapper* object::

    c.frame.tree.wrapper
    c.frame.body.wrapper
    c.frame.log.wrapper

See http://leoeditor.com/scripting.html#c-frame-body-bodyctrl for a description of the high-level text interface supported by all high-level text widgets, including the log and body classes.

These wrapper classes have a widget ivar, which is a reference to the corresponding Qt widget object.  For example::

    import PyQt4.QtGui as QtGui
    w =3D c.frame.body.wrapper.widget
    g.es(w)
    g.es(isinstance(w,QtGui.QTextBrowser)

yields::

    (LeoQTextBrowser) 62418136
    True

As shown, the LeoQTextBrowser class is a real (subclass of) QTextBrowser.

==== Terry

I'm not aware of a general solution to the problem of finding the various pieces of Leo's class structure. Basically there are all these classes defined in the source, and instances of these are attached to each other in a hierarchical network (with loops).

I've written an introspection function which lists the methods and instance variables (and class variables) of an arbitrary object by name and by type. I should release it. It builds its lists in a Leo outline, so you can navigate around that outline and expand nodes by introspection as needed.

It occurs to me that the same code could be used to search Leo's runtime object hierarchy for you, i.e. you enter 'insertIconFromFile' and it recursively searches for it.

-----

I didn't really finish the above para. The problem is that it's hard to guess what the names of the attachment points are, and the attaching is done in a variety of places, sometimes by factory functions which further obscure linkages. Not a fault with Leo, just the way programs work. So the tool I've written may be the best approach to mapping Leo's runtime structure. Another thing it could do, try and map 'major' classes, or at least classes from leo.core.* - i.e. ignore the built in types.

<t tx="ekr.20141108064630.14">If I want to use leo to make mathematical notes, how can I type in some special mathematical symbols? Or is there a good way to make mathematical notes using leo?

===== Terry

I use itex2MML with reStructuredText.  So within Leo you're looking at LaTeX math markup, and you get outputs in PDF and XHTML, with MathML in the latter.

===== Jose

I've been doing this for about a year now.  I use the math docutils directive.  A custom .XCompose file (for example: https://github.com/kragen/xcompose)  also helps.

===== Terry

I think math was added to docutils after I started using itex2mml, neater to use docutils built in math now I think.

Although having said that, playing with docutils math a bit suggests itex2mml gives more complete support for both MathML and perhaps LaTeX math (with the PDF target).

===== Jose

Terry, your setup is probably more flexible, but I haven't had any problems with docutils math. It seems to support all the syntax that I've found necessary.

I forgot to mention that the viewrendered plug-in doesn't display math correctly.  I'm not sure what the problem is, I remember trying to figure it out a while back, but I never got anywhere.  It's not really a big problem though, I have scripts to compile nodes to html/pdfs and open them in firefox/pdf reader; math works fine that way.

===== offray

Is not properly Leo, but is python related, tailored for math and with a web interface and has leo bindings, check IPython: http://ipython.org/

I'm trying to create a interactive chart in a embedded in a new leo pane using matplotlib. However, I am not sure about the the best way to implement this. I would appreciate some guidance on this please? The questions I would like answered are:

1. How do I create a new blank pane for embedding a chart as well as other QtWidgets.

2. Can I do this in a script or do I need to work with leo source?

I want to create a data processing and visualization tool kit in leo. Like Excel but using nodes instead of columns. Nodes will have data and I want to create new data nodes by applying python functions to data in existing nodes. The thing missing is the visualization within a leo pane (I can easily launch a chart in it's own window).

You can run this script from any body pane::

    '''
    A script that adds a MatPlotLib pane to Leo.
    
    After running this script, right click on one of the pane dividers and
    select Insert. A new pane with a button 'Action' appears. Click it, and
    select "Add matplot" from the context menu.
    '''
    
    from leo.core.leoQt import QtWidgets

----- OP

I have managed to get a matplotlib graph embedded within a pane in leo as a widget. I now need some help with how to interact with the widget using scripts in leo. I am unsure about the following:
 
*1/ How do I expose the widget within the leo environment?* 

If you were only going to have one and you weren't going to destroy it, you could just do something simple like c._matplot = self in its constrictor (assuming c was passed to the constructor).

If you're going to have more than one and they may be destroyed, it might be simplest to let the free_layout / nested_splitter system manage them::

    ts = c.free_layout.get_top_splitter()
    matplotters = ts.findChildren(myMatplotWidget)

should return a list of the widgets of your class in the layout, but only if they're in the main window, widgets in extra windows opened from the "Open window" context menu item would be missed, I can add a find_children() method to complement the find_child() method the splitters already have to account for this.

Detail: the above is just using Qt's QObject.findChildren(), the nested_splitter find_child() and (not yet written) find_children() versions search the extra windows as well.

Here I have created a self.mat in your MatplotPaneProvider class to make the windget accessible but it doesn't feel like the correct way to do this.

@language python

    mat = MatplotPaneProvider(c)
    mat.mat.someMethod()
    mat.mat.someOtherMethod()
    
@language rest
 
2. I would also like to make the widget accessible from any script within leo. What's the leo way of doing this?

See above
 
3. If I create more than 1 pane containing these widgets. How do I switch between them in scripts?

See above

4. Running this script more than once creates multiple items for Add Matplot when pressing the Action button. How do I stop this from happening? I have already tried returning a unique integer in * ns_provider_id *but that did not work.*
 
The value returned by ns_provider_id should be unique for the provider class, but constant. So it can just return something like "matplotlib provider ver 1"

For the last several weeks I've used clones in a new, more effective way, inspired by git's stash/unstash commands. Here are the main ideas.

1. [Most important] I avoid putting clones in two different *external* files.

For any task, I create a task node that resides in @file leoToDo.txt. I clone that node and put it in the outline, *never* in any other @file node. This instantly eliminates clone wars.

2. I use top-level "stashed" nodes/trees in my local copy of leoPy.leo.

These clones are *not* written to any external file, so they would be lost if I lost leoPy.leo. But the risks are negligible because all stashed nodes are clones of nodes that *do* exist in external files.

3. I have two main stashed trees: recent files and recent code.

The "recent files" tree contains clones of all the @file nodes I have worked on recently. This speeds up access to them. That happens surprisingly often--often enough to be well worth maintaining the tree. Furthermore, because Leo's new pylint command now works on trees, I can check all recently-changed files simply by running pylint on the "recent files" tree.

The "recent code" tree is even more valuable, for three reasons. The first is obvious--it speeds access to recently-changed nodes.

Second, the "recent code" tree allows me to work on multiple tasks without getting overwhelmed by details and loose nodes lying around. I add organizer nodes as needed to make accessing the nodes faster, and also to jog my memory about what I was doing when I changed those nodes ;-)

Third, the "recent code" tree allows me *not* to put clones in the @file leoProjects.txt tree. This leads me to...

4. I use clones in a stylized way when fixing and committing bugs.

I always use clones when working on a project. A "task" node contains clones of all nodes related to the task. The task node typically remains in leoToDo.txt until the task is completely finished. While working on the bug, I create a clone of the task node, and move that clone to the bottom top-level node of the outline. Among other things, this makes it easy to limit searches without actually choosing "suboutline only" in the Find panel. This workflow is decades old.

The following is the heart of the new workflow. When a task is complete, I do the following:

A. First, I create a **stashed-task** node, containing all the clones that were previously in the task node.

The *stashed-task* becomes pre-writing for the commit log. The *task* node instantly becomes pre-writing for the release notes, so if it needs to discuss any code in the clones that have just been moved to the stashed-task node, I write those words immediately, while all details are fresh in my mind.

B. Now I move the cloned task node that is in leoToDo.txt to the appropriate place in leoProjects.txt.

C. Next I do the commit.

The *other* clone of the task node, and the stashed task node are still within easy reach, and I typically use both nodes to create the commit log. The commit will typically consist of the changed leoToDo.txt and leoProjects.txt and whatever .py files the task itself changed. Happily, leoToDo.txt and leoProjects.txt are now up-to-date because of steps A and B.

D. Finally, I clean up.

I delete the top-level clone of the task node, and move the stashed-task
node to the "recent code" tree.

E. Later, when it appears that activity has died down on various projects, I'll delete nodes from the "recent files" an "recent code" trees. This is a minor judgment call: I want to leave nodes in the trees while they are useful, but not significantly longer than that. I do *not* regard these trees as permanently useful. leoProjects.txt should contain *all* permanent notes about a project.

===== Conclusions

This work flow may seem complicated. Believe me, it is not. It's easier to use than to describe.

This workflow has big advantages:

1. Clone wars are gone for good.
2. All recent data is easily available.
3. Task nodes and stashed-task nodes provide natural places for proto-documentation.
4. Banning clones from leoProjects.txt forces me to complete the first draft of the documentation before committing the fix.

Here is a surprisingly useful workflow tip related to GTD.

Ideas often "intrude" when I am busy with something else. When that happens, I create a top-level node of the form::

    ** description of idea

Now I can continue what I was doing! This is such a simple idea, but it's really really important: it means I never have to put off getting my ideas into Leo. The "**" draws my attention to the new to-do item. Later, when I am not fully immersed in the previous task, I can put the "**" node somewhere else.

It's super important to deal with new ideas *instantly* but *without* greatly interrupting the task at hand. Creating "**" nodes does that. This new workflow has been a big improvement to my GTD practice.

.. @language python below
A head-slapping moment: the so-called high-level interfaced throughout Leo's core to interact with Leo's text panes lacks a way of getting the length of text *without* making a copy of the text.

This is more than a slight oversight: I imagine there are several place were the code does s = w.getAllText() merely so it can use len(s)! This is a huge strain on the GC for large p.b.

Worse, the absence of w.getTextLength() has lead to the most unfortunate LeoQTextEditWidget.lengthHelper, which calculated the length of the text using QTextCursor methods! This is catastrophically slow for large text. This method was doubling node load times for large nodes. In other words, w.getTextLength() is an essential part of fixing git bug 28: https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/28

But nooooooo... w.getTextLength() is far from easy to do. There is no QTextEdit or QTextDocument method that delivers the length of the text! This is a *huge* hole in the QTextEdit and QTextDocument api's, but there is nothing we can do about that.

The simplest thing that could possibly work would be::

@language python

    def getTextLength(self):
        w = self.widget
        return len(w.getAllText())
        
@language rest

But this would be a step backwards because it hides the fact that it is expensive.

It might be possible to cache the value of w.getAllText in an "text changed" event handler in LeoQTextBrowser:(QTextBrowser). But I would like to avoid this approach--any bug would lead to data loss or corruption. I may play around with this, but for now it's not likely to happen. See below for a workaround.

By analogy with w.getTextLength(), we can imagine a p.b_length method that would simply return len(p.v._bodyString). This, at least, is worth doing.

===== Summary

w.getTextLength() isn't trivial.

Caching the value returned by w.getAllText() seems too dangerous.

As a work-around, the crucial node-selection logic will attempt to minimize calls to w.getAllText. There, and *only* there, it should be possible to create a *single* copy of the text and pass that copy around to all code that needs it. It would be a complication, but a completely safe one.

Otoh, p/v.b_length are trivial and useful. They will be added asap.

-------------

Two parts to this reply:

===== Part 1: defining w.getTextLength

&gt; w.getTextLength() isn't trivial...Caching the value returned by w.getAllText() seems too dangerous.

Actually, defining w.getTextLength using a textChanged event handler in LeoQTextBrowser is straightforward::

@language python

    def onTextChanged(self):
        '''The textChanged event handler.  Cached the text in self.leo_s.'''
        self.leo_s = s = g.u(self.toPlainText())

    def getTextLength(self):
        '''Return the length of all the text.'''
        if 1: # safe.
            s = g.u(self.toPlainText())
            if s != self.leo_s:
                g.trace('can not happen: text mismatch.')
                self.leo_s = s
            return len(self.leo_s)
        else: # fast
            return len(self.leo_s)
            
@language rest

We can use the "safe" version of getTextLength until we are *sure* the can not happen message never happens ;-)

Otoh, we must be careful: onTextChanged will be called in the middle of the node-switching logic.

===== Part 2: doing without w.getTextLength

The simplest thing that could possibly work is to avoid the extra call to w.getAllText in the node switching logic in selectHelper.

Here are the relevant parts of selectHelper. (w is a LeoQTextEditWidget).

1. setBodyTextAfterSelect *already* calls w.getAllText() to get the "before" text. This is unavoidable.

The "after" text will be p.b, where p is the *new* position.

2. restoreCursorAndScroll calls w.setInsertPoint, which just calls w.setSelectionRangeHelper.

3. w.setSelectionRangeHelper is the problem It used to call the horribly slow lengthHelper. Now it calls w.getAllText()

But w.getAllText must be the new p.b! So the selectHelper logic could simply pass an optional s argument to w.setInsertPoint and w.setSelectionRangeHelper. If present, setSelectionRangeHelper will use s rather than calling w.getAllText.

Imo, this is the safe, if not exactly elegant way.

<t tx="ekr.20150210062226.4">This appendix documents the Mulder/Ream update algorithm in detail, with an informal proof of its correctness.

Prior to Leo 5.1, Leo used Bernhard Mulder's original algorithm to read @shadow files. Starting with Leo 5.1, Leo uses this algorithm to read both @clean and @shadow files. Conceptually, both algorithms work as described in the next section.

In February 2015 EKR realized that the @shadow algorithm could be used to update @clean (@nosent) files. Simplifying the algorithm instantly became a top priority. The new code emerged several days later, made possible by the x.sentinels array. It is an important milestone in Leo's history.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150210062226.5">The algorithm depends on three simple, guaranteed, properties of
SequenceMatcher.opcodes. See
https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html#sequencematcher-examples

**Fact 1**: The opcodes tell how to turn x.a (a list of lines) into x.b
(another list of lines).

The code uses the a and b terminology. It's concise and easy to remember.

**Fact 2**: The opcode indices ai, aj, bi, bj *never* change because
neither x.a nor x.b changes.

Plain lines of the result can be built up by copying lines from x.b to x.results::

    'replace'   x.results.extend(x.b[b1:b2])
    'delete'    do nothing  (b1 == b2)
    'insert'    x.results.extend(x.b[b1:b2])
    'equal'     x.results.extend(x.b[b1:b2])

**Fact 3**: The opcodes *cover* both x.a and x.b, in order, without any gaps.

This is an explicit requirement of sm.get_opcode:

- The first tuple has ai==aj==bi==bj==0.

- Remaining tuples have ai == (aj from the preceding tuple) and bi == (bj
  from the previous tuple).
  
Keep in mind this crucial picture:

- The slices x.a[ai:aj] cover the x.a array, in order without gaps.
- The slices x.b[bi:bj] cover the x.b array, in order without gaps.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150210062226.6">Given the x.sentinels array, the strategy for creating the results is
simple. Given indices ai, aj, bi, bj from an opcode, the algorithm:

- Writes sentinels from x.sentinels[i], for i in range(ai,aj).

- Writes plain lines from b[i], for i in range(bi,bj).

This "just works" because the indices cover both a and b.

- The algorithm writes sentinels exactly once (in order) because each
  sentinel appears in x.sentinels[i] for some i in range(len(x.a)).

- The algorithm writes plain lines exactly once (in order) because
  each plain line appears in x.b[i] for some i in range(len(x.b)).

This completes an informal proof of the correctness of the algorithm.

The leading and trailing sentinels lines are easy special cases. This
code, appearing before the main loop, ensures that leading lines are
written first, and only once::

    x.put_sentinels(0)
    x.sentinels[0] = []

Similarly, this line, at the end of the main loop, writes trailing
sentinels::

    x.results.extend(x.trailing_sentinels)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150210062226.7">The algorithm creates an updated set of lines *with* sentinels using the
@clean outline and the updated external file. These new lines then replace
the original @clean with a new @clean tree. The algorithm uses only
difflib. It will work with *any* kind of text file. No knowledge of any
language is needed.

The algorithm depends on simple, guaranteed, properties of indices in
SequenceMatcher opcodes.

The algorithm steps through x.sentinels and x.b, extending x.results
as it goes.

The algorithm gets all needed data directly from opcode indices into
x.sentinels and x.b. Using opcode indices requires neither reader
classes nor auxiliary indices.

The algorithm is simple enough to be understood at first reading. I'll
remember its details for the rest of my life.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150211131925.9">Mulder's original algorithm was hard to understand or to change. The
culprit was the x.mapping array, which mapped indices into arrays of lines
*with* sentinels to indices into arrays of lines *without* sentinels.

The new algorithm replaces the x.mapping array with the x.sentinels array.
As a result, diff indices never need to be adjusted and handling diff
opcodes is easy.

For any index i, x.sentinels[i] is the (possibly empty) list of sentinel
lines that precede line a[i]. Computing x.sentinels from old_private_lines
is easy. Crucially, x.a and x.sentinels are *parallel arrays*. That is,
len(x.a) == len(x.sentinels), so indices into x.a are *also* indices into
x.sentinels.

With @clean and @file, Leo can store **persistent data** in nodes. This
information consists of the node's **gnx** (Global Node Index) and the
node's **uA**, (User Attributes). The gnx gives each node a unique,
immutable identity. Gnx's make clones possible. The uA allows scripts and
plugins to associate arbitrarily much additional data with each node.

.. To do: links to further discussion of gnx and uA.

By default, Leo's importers preserve neither gnx's nor uA's. This makes
imported @auto trees second class citizens. To remedy this, if an outline
contains an @persistence node, Leo will save data in the @persistence tree
that allows Leo to recover gnx's and uA's when re-reading @auto files
later. This allows clone links and uA's to persist.

@persistence is an optional feature. The stored data is akin to bookmarks.
The data can "break" (become inaccessible) if the structure (including
class/method/function names) changes. However, the data will typically
break infrequently. To disable this feature, just delete an existing
@persistence node or change @persistence to @@persistence.</t>

- Updating an @clean tree is faster that importing an @auto tree.

<t tx="ekr.20150220145456.4">For simplicity, this discussion will assume that we are updating an
external file, x, created with @clean x. The update algorithm works
exactly the same way with @shadow trees.

The algorithm works with *any* kind of text file. The algorithm uses only
difflib. It knows nothing about the text or its meaning. No parsing is ever
done.

Suppose file x has been changed outside of Leo. When Leo reads x it does
the following:

1. Recreates the *old* version of x *without* sentinels by writing the
   @clean x *outline* into a string, as if it were writing the @clean x
   outline again.
   
2. Recreates all the lines of x *with* sentinels by writing the @clean x
   *outline* into a string, as if it was writing an @file node! Let's call
   these lines the **old sentinels** lines.
   
3. Uses difflib.SequenceMatcher to create a set of diffs between the
   old and new versions of x *without* sentinels.
   
   **Terminology**: the diffs tell how to change file a into file b. The
   actual code uses this terminology: **a** is set of lines in the old
   version of x, **b** is the set of lines in the new version of x.
   
4. Creates a set of lines, the **new sentinels lines** using the old
   sentinels lines, the a and b lines and the diffs.
   
   This is the magic. Bernhard Mulder's genius was conceiving that a
   three-way merge of lines could produce the new outline, *with*
   sentinels. The code is in x.propagate_changed_lines and its helpers.
   
5. Replaces the @clean tree with the new tree created by reading the new
   sentinels lines with the @file read logic.

**Important**: The update algorithm never changes sentinels. It never
inserts or deletes nodes. The user is responsible for creating nodes to
hold new lines, or for deleting nodes that become empty as the result of
deleting lines.

    pair: sentinel lines; Tutorial

Before Leo 5.1, the recommended way to create external files was with **@file trees**. @file trees use the same markup as @clean trees.

The only difference between @clean and @file is that @file insert **sentinel lines** into external files. Sentinel lines are comments corresponding to markup. Sentinel lines *explicitly* represent structure.

Sentinel comments greatly simplify the update algorithm. There are no ambiguous lines @file trees! @file nodes are especially useful when everyone in a project uses Leo. Leo's sources use @file trees for the convenience of Leo developers.

@file is recommended if you seldom share files with others. Nevertheless,
most people will prefer to use @clean instead of @file. For example,
changing::

    @clean myfile.py
    
to::

    @file myfile.py
    
in the earlier example will create the file myfile.py whose contents looks something like this::

    #@+leo-ver=5-thin
    #@+node:ekr.20131023081456.2537: * @file myfile.py
    #@@language python
    #@@tabwidth -4
    #@+&lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    #@+node:ekr.20131023081456.2538: ** &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    '''This is the docstring for this python module.'''
    #@-&lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    #@+others
    #@+node:ekr.20131023081456.2539: ** main
    def main():
        print('hello from main')
    #@-others
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    #@-leo
    
Not pleasant to look at. However, sentinel lines won't bother you if you
seldom change the external file outside Leo. For example, Leo's developers
use @file nodes for Leo's own sources.

    pair: Section Reference; Tutorial
    pair: Expansion; Tutorial
    pair: Markup; Tutorial
    pair: @others; Tutorial
    
This section discusses Leo's markup. This markup tells how to create
external files from @clean trees.

**Essential Terms**:

- A **section name** is any text of the form: &lt;&lt; any text &gt;&gt;.
  (&gt;&gt; must not appear in "any text".)

- A **section definition node** is any node whose headline starts with a
  section name.

- A **section reference** is a section name that appears in body text.

| Leo creates external files containing @others directives by writing the *expansion* of the @clean node.
| The **expansion** of *any* node is the node's body text after making these text **substitutions**:

1. Leo replaces @others with the *expansion* of all descendant nodes
   **except** section definition nodes. That's how @others got its name.

2. Leo replaces section references by the *expansion* of the body text of
   the corresponding section definition node.
   
Whitespace is significant before @others and section references. Leo adds
the leading whitespace appearing before each @others directive or section
reference to every line of their expansion. As a result, Leo can generate
external files even for Python.  For example, here is a cute trick::

    if 1:
        &lt;&lt; a section &gt;&gt;
    if 0:
        @others

**Notes**:

- Neither whitespace nor capitalization are important in section names.
  The following section names are equivalent::
  
      &lt;&lt; a section &gt;&gt;
      &lt;&lt;ASection&gt;&gt;

- Any node may contain a *single* @others directive. No node may contain more
  than one @others directive.

- Nodes that *aren't* section definition nodes are included in the expansion
  of the *nearest* ancestor node containing an @others directive.
  
.. index::
    pair: Orphan Node; Tutorial

- An **orphan node** is a descendant of an @clean node not included in any
  substitution. Leo refuses to write external files containing orphan
  nodes. Instead, Leo writes the @clean tree to the .leo file itself,
  thereby preserving all data.

**Example 1**: The body of the @clean node for a typical Python module will
look something like::

    '''A docstring.'''
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    @others
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
        
**Example 2**:  Here is a typical Python class definition in Leo::

    class MyClass:
        '''A docstring.'''
        @others
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150221052529.5">Leo 5.1 introduced the ability to update @clean trees from changes made to
the corresponding external file. This is one of the most important
developments in Leo's history. Previously, Leo could perform such updates
only if the external file contained **sentinel lines**, comment lines
corresponding to Leo markup that indicated outline structure.

.. index::
    pair: Mulder/Ream update algorithm; Tutorial
    pair: Update algorithm; Tutorial
    
The update algorithm is a clever three-way diff/merge of lines computed
from the outline and the external files. You don't have to know how it
works in order to use Leo. It is `explained here &lt;http://leoeditor.com/appendices.html#the-mulder-ream-update-algorithm&gt;`_.

In most cases, the update algorithm "just works". However, there is one
edge case that you should be aware of.

**Ambiguous lines** are lines that could be placed either at the end of a
node or at the beginning of the following node. The update algorithm must
**guess** where to place such lines--there simply is not enough data to
know for sure. The algorithm always places ambiguous lines at the start of
the following node because it's more common to add lines to the end of
nodes.

The update algorithm is **sound** because guesses do not affect the
resulting external file. That is, the contents of the external file will be
the same whether an ambiguous line is placed at the end of one node or the
beginning of the next.

The exact placement of ambiguous lines may not matter as far as the
contents of the external files is concerned, but it will certainly matter
to you! You will want lines placed in their proper nodes.

Happily, Leo reports which nodes have been updated. You can override
guesses manually by moving lines to a new node. Once you save the outline,
the lines will no longer become ambiguous. The next time the update
algorithm runs, it will no longer have to guess where the lines belong!
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150221052529.6">You now know enough to create external files and to choose between @clean and @file. The following sections discuss directives affecting external files.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150221052529.7">This tutorial discussed @clean first for three reasons:

1. To avoid making excuses for sentinel lines.

2. To brag about the @clean update algorithm.

3. It is often more convenient to avoid sentinels. For example, when I study other people's code I do the following:

- Create a `git &lt;http://git-scm.com/&gt;`_ repo of the directory to be studied, adding all the source files and doing an initial commit.
  
- Use an `import script &lt;tutorial-scripting.html#import-scripts&gt;`_ to create the desired @clean nodes.

- Explicitly save all the imported files using Ctrl-Shift-W (write-at-file-nodes).

- Use git diff to ensure that no important changes have been made while importing the nodes.

- Use git diff to track any changes I make (such as adding tracing or debugging statements) for the purposes of studying the code.

Using @clean is an essential part of this work flow. The diffs would be much harder to read if I had imported files into @file trees instead.

Nevertheless, there are advantages to using @file instead of @clean. All these advantages arise because external files created by @file contain explicit outline structure.

1. Leo can read @file trees more quickly and without guesses. There is never any need for you to move ambiguous lines from one node to another.
   
2. Sentinels allow you to share structure simply by sending the external file. This is an overwhelming advantage for Leo's developers.
   
3. A minor advantage: @file makes Leo files smaller. Leo stores the entire @clean *tree* in the .leo file, but only stores the top-level @file *node* in the .leo file.
   
In short: use @clean for most purposes. Use @file when all developers in a project use Leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150221092405.2">Use @auto instead of @clear when you expect other people to make substantial changes to an external file without using Leo.

.. index::
    pair: @auto; Tutorial
    pair: Importer; Tutorial

When reading @auto files, Leo **importers** create an outline from the external file. Importers create nodes for each class, method and function in the external file.

Notes:

- Leo determines the language using the file's extension.

- Importers exist for C, C#, elisp, html, .ini files, Java, Javascript, Pascal, PHP, Python, TypeScript, vimoutliner files and xml.

- If no importer exists for a file, Leo reads the entire file into an @edit node.

Leo is a PIM, an IDE and an outliner. Video tutorials: http://leoeditor.com/screencasts.html Text tutorials: http://leoeditor.com/tutorial.html

The highlights of Leo 5.1
--------------------------

* @clean trees, one of the most important developments in Leo's history.

  @clean create external files without sentinel comments, yet Leo can
  update @trees from changes made to the corresponding external files,
  something long thought impossible. @clean trees preserve clone links and
  user attributes (uA's). Reading @clean trees is faster than reading @auto
  or @shadow trees.
    
  The Mulder/Ream algorithm updates @clean trees from changes made from the
  corresponding external files. This is a completely rewritten and much
  simpler version of Bernhard Mulder's original @shadow update algorithm.

  @shadow is now deprecated. @clean is superior to @shadow in all respects.
  Leo will support all flavors of @auto indefinitely.
  
* A new web page, http://leoeditor.com/load-leo.html, displays .leo files
  in the browser.

* A new IdleTime class greatly simplifies idle-time handling.

* Leo now honors @language inside @doc parts, a major convenience.

goto-global-line doesn't work properly on @nosent files.

It seems that it counts non-existing sentinel lines so it positions cursor
few lines before the requested. The exact difference between required line
number and found one depends on size of file and number of nodes, and also
grows with required line number.

You can exhibit this by looking in attached Leo file. For example Alt+g 45
should position cursor on the declaration line of function temp7(a), but it
positions cursor on line 39.

Sentinels create **identity**, the notion that a particular
nodes starts at *this* place in the external file and
extends to *this other* place. Identity is a persistent,
invariant attribute of a file: Leo recreates all the nodes
of the external files when re-reading the file.

It's really that simple, but here are some consequences:

1. Identity remains even when the contents of a node
   changes. Thus, there is *no way* to use content-related
   mechanisms to recreate identity. This means, for example,
   that git can never help recover identity.

2. Leo's sentinels mark an *arbitrary* range of text within

I have been wondering whether it would be possible to use xslt to render
.leo files from web pages. This would build on Ville's work. First, a demo:

1. Copy the two attached files to the same folder on your hard drive.

Note: recent revs have added these two files to the top-level leo folder,
so you could also use those files instead. Both demo files are now in the
top-level leo-editor in the git repo *and* on leoeditor.com.

2. Open xslt-test.leo in your browser.  You should see something like this:

    test.leo

    This is a test

        node 1

        Node 1 text.

        node 2

        Node 2 text.

That is, browsers (tested with IE and Mozilla) can render .leo files on
your file system as html.

Alas, there are problems rending .leo files from urls instead of files. But
when we succeed we will have a read-only version of Leo as a web app!

===== About leo_to_html.xsl

Ville created leo_to_html.xsl, but I didn't understand its significance
until early this morning. This xslt file tells a web browser (or other xslt
processor) how to render a .leo file as html.

I made several changes this morning to leo_to_html.xsl so that it works
with the "tryit" editor for xslt at w3schools:
http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/tryxslt.asp?xmlfile=cdcatalog&amp;xsltfile=cdcatalog_ex1

This editor is a good way to discover problems either in .xsl files
themselves or references to .xsl files from .xml files.

===== Problems

It does not seem possible to use leo_to_html.xsl directly:

1. Visiting http://leoeditor.com/xslt-test.leo does not work.

The browser renders xslt-test.leo xml, not html. That is, the browser does
not perform the xslt transformations.

2. Visiting
   https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/blob/master/xslt-test.leo shows
   the "raw" xml, without the xslt transformations being applied.

The reason is clear enough. The url is a *representation* of the .leo file,
not the .leo file itself.

3. xslt-test.leo contains the following line::

    &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="leo_to_html.xsl"?&gt;

This line is supposed to be set by the following setting::

    @string stylesheet = ekr_test

This default is useless, and setting it to::

    @string stylesheet = type="text/xsl" href="leo_to_html.xsl"

does not appear to work. I'll look into this, but cutting and pasting the
desired &lt;?xml-stylesheet &gt; element into .leo files should work well enough
for testing.

4. By default, Mozilla refuses to render xslt-test.leo containing the
   following stylesheet element::

    &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="leoeditor.com/leo_to_html.xsl"?&gt;

In other words, Mozilla refuses to execute "remote" .xsl files. A cryptic
message is shown instead. Googling that message gives:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3420513/firefox-and-remote-xsl-stylesheets

Apparently Mozilla enforces "same origin" policy. But it's no good relaxing
that policy: browsers on smart phones are probably even more restrictive.

===== Conclusions

The tryit editor shows that it is possible to apply arbitrary xslt style
sheets to arbitrary xml files. We should be able to create a page, say on
leoeditor.com, that would render .leo files properly using leo_to_html.xsl.
The question is, how exactly to do this?

This is exciting, despite the problem listed above, and probably others.
The xslt approach is almost infinitely easier than alternative approaches.

Once we can properly render, say, a link to a .leo file on GitHub, we can
start improving leo_to_html.xsl. The obvious thing to do is to change the
xsl so that it generates html similar to that generated by Bernhard

Leo 5.1 adds the LeoQtGui.IdleTime class. Creating multiple instances of this class allows multiple, independent (or cooperating) idle-time handlers. g.IdleTime is a thin wrapper that returns None if g.app.gui doesn't an IdleTime class. 

The following creates an instance of the IdleTime class that calls the given handler at idle time, no more than once every 500 msec::
    
@language python

    def handler(it):
        '''The IdleTime handler: called at idle time.'''
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace(it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),'%2.4f' % (delta_t))
        if it.count &gt;= 5:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    it = g.IdleTime(c,handler,delay=500)
    if it: it.start()
    
@language rest

Here is the output::

    handler 1 ekr.leo 0.5100
    handler 2 ekr.leo 1.0300
    handler 3 ekr.leo 1.5400
    handler 4 ekr.leo 2.0500
    handler 5 ekr.leo 2.5610
    handler done

Timer instances are completely independent::

@language python

    def handler1(it):
        '''The IdleTime handler: called at idle time.'''
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace('%2s %s %2.4f' % (it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),delta_t))
        if it.count &gt;= 5:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    def handler2(it):
        '''The IdleTime handler: called at idle time.'''
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace('%2s %s %2.4f' % (it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),delta_t))
        if it.count &gt;= 10:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    it1 = g.IdleTime(c,handler1,delay=500)
    it2 = g.IdleTime(c,handler2,delay=1000)
    if it1 and it2:
        it1.start()
        it2.start()
        
@language rest

Here is the output::

    handler1  1 ekr.leo 0.5200
    handler2  1 ekr.leo 1.0100

<t tx="ekr.20150311123850.54">Rev 7a851eb enables automatic updating of @nosent files. When loading a .leo file, Leo will automatically update @nosent trees if the corresponding external file has been changed outside Leo! This is one of the most important advances in Leo's history.

As discussed yesterday, using @nosent files is about twice as fast as using @shadow trees. No shadow directories or shadow files are needed: it's trivial to recreate the "shadow" data from the @nosent tree!

Why, of why, did we never see this before? It could have been done at any time since Leo supported @shadow.

Finally, Leo reports all changes using the "recovered nodes" mechanism. No new code was required: the core @shadow code was not changed in any way.

at.readOneAtNosentNode and two simple helpers handle all the details. readOneAtNosentNode uses the @shadow algorithm to compute the updated lines of the @nosent tree, exactly as described yesterday. If the new lines match the old, nothing more need be done: we can use the existing @nosent tree as is. Otherwise, the new lines are passed to at.readOpenFile to delete the old tree and create the @nosent tree. This part of the code is similar to the code in at.read, but it is much simpler because caching is not involved. In essence, everything "just worked" from the get go.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150311123850.55">I just want to provide my own thoughts about the importance of @clean. I look at the posts in this group a fair amount because I find the discussion interesting but I had abandoned leo as a day-to-day tool principally because of the sentinels in @file nodes. Even for solo projects, I just found them visually unappealing and beyond that occasionally confusing when I went to edit files with external editors. I would sometimes start a project in leo, particularly if it was based on code I developed in the past using leo, and then would use the old @nosent to save a version of the code without sentinels and then use my external editor of choice and not use leo at all. I missed many of the features of leo but just couldn't get over the sentinel issue.

@clean really seems to solve all the issues that I had. In particular--and somehow this point doesn't seem to me to have been emphasized enough--it seems to fully support organizer nodes. They are one of the great things about leo--it's happy to guess initially at what the structure of your program is but it's completely up to you to determine the structure and the ability to do things like break up long methods, group like methods, group menu actions in GUI code, etc etc is one of the very cool things about leo. My limited but growing experience with @clean's handling of external changes has been mainly with incremental (as opposed to more sweeping) code changes, and the assignment of new lines is reasonable and you can always fix them it quickly if you don't like how external changes have been handled.

There have been some posts about the recovered nodes, comparing the old and new nodes where there were external changes. I think it's genius. As opposed to hoping that leo has correctly incorporated external changes, it's all there in case you want to take a closer look. Without this, I would just not have the confidence that external changes were being applied correctly and while you can always do a git diff, I am not looking to do that every time I change a file externally especially if I am not at the point where I am about to do a commit.

There has been some discussion of @auto v. @clean. Preference is obviously a matter of taste. I will say that for me the fact that node headlines are unaffected by external file changes is a feature not a problem since I place notes in the headlines that I want preserved when I edit files externally. Yes, if the node headlines are the method names then they won't be updated if an external edit changes a method name but this was true of @file as well.

The ability to work on projects with people who don't have leo is obvious; one perhaps slightly less obvious benefit of no sentinels is that I suspect that the likelihood that someone will clone a git repository is reduced when that repository's code is riddled with leo sentinels (unless the potential cloner is a leo loyalist). The one downside to no sentinels--there is no evidence that leo is being used but I think that raises the broader question of marketing leo, which I certainly believe will be aided significantly by being able to take advantage of leo without sentinels in external files.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150311123850.56">@clean is the long-sought breakthrough that just might allow Leo to "go viral". For the very first time, Leo can be used in *all* situations without compromise.  There is no longer any need to make excuses for sentinel lines, or argue whether people should accept them.  Sentinels are simply gone.

I have just realized how inconvenient sentinels might be for my *own* work flow.  This was a shocking revelation.  To illustrate, here is an excerpt from the programming tutorial:

QQQQQ
When I study other people's code I do the following:

- Create a git repo of the directory to be studied, adding all the source files and doing an initial commit.
 
- Use an `import script`_ to create the desired @clean nodes.

- Explicitly save all the imported files using Ctrl-Shift-W (write-at-file-nodes).

- Use `git`_ diff to ensure that no important changes have been made while importing the nodes.

- Use git diff to track any changes I make (such as adding tracing or debugging statements) for the purposes of studying the code.

Using @clean is an essential part of this work flow. The diffs would be much harder to read if I had imported files into @file trees instead.
QQQQQ

In short, I have just now realized how badly sentinels interfered with git diffs.

This post will summarize what has already been done and what will be done in the next few days.  Let's start with the basics...

===== About wrappers and widgets

Wrapper and widget classes are at the heart of Leo's design. Clarifying the relationships between wrappers and widgets started the present avalanche.

Here is what you *must know* to understand Leo's core:

1. A **widget** is an actual Qt widget.

Leo's core seldom accesses widgets directly. Instead...

2. A **wrapper class** defines a standard api that hides the details of the underlying gui **text** widgets.

Leo's core uses this api almost exclusively. That is, Leo's core code treats wrappers *as if* they were only text widgets there are!

There is, however, a back door for (hopefully rare!) special cases. All wrapper classes define an official "widget" ivar, so core or plugin code can gain access to the real Qt widget using wrapper.widget. Searching for wrapper.widget should find all gui-dependent snippets of code in Leo's core.

Wrappers are crucial, even if Leo *always* uses the Qt gui. Wrappers allow users to choose different Qt widgets for the body pane, without changing *any* of Leo's core code, except the startup code that actually allocates widgets. Wrappers allow Leo's text-handling code to remain unchanged regardless of whether the body or log panes are a QTextBrowser or a QsciScintilla widget. Without wrappers, all of Leo's text-editing commands would have to know the details of the api of the actual Qt text widget!

==== Summary of the avalanche

Here is what is happening now in Leo's code base, and in my thinking!

1. A collapse in the complexity of relationships between Leo's most important classes and between the files containing those classes.

qt_text.py was supposedly a minor reorg. Wrong! It has become the road map to the reorganization of all of Leo's fundamental classes:

- qt_text.py is *self contained*: it doesn't depend on any other classes!

- qt_text.py defines a QTextMixin class. This is a new kind of class for me. As its name suggest, it is not so much a base class as a helper class. It provides helper code for all of Leo's Qt wrapper widgets.

- All the classes that use QTextMixin implement the HighLevelInterface class in leoFrame.py.

The HighLevelInterface class will soon morph into the WrapperInterface class. Th WrapperInterface class will contain only the definition of methods and their docstrings. Unlike the HighLevelInterface class, the WrapperInterface will contain *no* redirection code!

- If we were (heaven forbid) going to change Leo's gui, we would simply use a copy of qt_text.py, say new_gui.text.py, as a starting point.

2. All "redirection" code will soon be gone.

Ville, Terry and I will be much happier. Eliminating this cruft makes Leo's code both lighter and thicker, to use the go terminology. It's lighter because there is far less blah, blah, blah. It's thicker because there is less to check and to fail.

It's easy to eliminate redirection. For example, the LeoBody methods that just call the corresponding wrapper methods will soon be gone. We'll change::

    c.frame.body.wrapperMethod

to::

    c.frame.body.wrapper.wrapperMethod

Doh! This should have been done years ago. Yes, it's more verbose, but it's also more explicit. Furthermore, few such calls actually exist!

3. widget.widget and other type-checking horrors will soon be a thing of the past.

New coding conventions will remove all confusion between wrappers and widgets. Wrappers will *always* be called wrappers, never widgets.

There has always been something both fundamentally wrong and confusing about widget.widget. The first widget must have a different type than the second, but there is *no* indication of this fundamental fact. The reorg changes widget.widget to wrapper.widget everywhere.

4. I have a new approach toward type checking.

It is obvious now, in retrospect, that clarity of design is something much more important than type checking! Leo's code will soon make the types of objects *explicit* and this far more important in practice than even "perfect" static type checking. This is a revolution in my thinking.

pylint, while supremely important for day-to-day programming, is *totally inadequate* to have produced the design changes I have been discussing.

Now that widgets are always clearly distinct from wrappers, we could imaging type-checking assertions to verify their apparent types. Imo, such assertions are seldom pythonic, but in this case assertions might be good documentation, if nothing else. The assertions would be based on the following functions:

- g.isWrapper(obj): calls g.app.gui.isWrapper(obj)
- g.isWidget(obj): calls g.app.gui.isWidget(obj)

5. A dead-easy script shows how to enforce the relationships between types that really matter.

This is a big Aha. The script merely compares dir(o1) with dir(o2), where o1 is the "template" HighLevelInterface class in leoFrame.py and o2 is one of QTextEditWrapper or QScintillaWrapper. You could call this the "back door" approach to type checking. It's sooo easy! No more messing with ast's!

As a result of running this script, (given in the P.P.S.) I was able to removed cruft from both the HighLevelInterface class, and other parts of Leo's code.

===== Summary

None of these massive changes adds anything directly to Leo :-)

However, they make understanding and changing Leo's code far easier and more pleasant. Leo's code is now more beautiful.

Imo, these changes are long overdue. They fundamentally improve Leo's code base.

Edward

P.S. git and easier access to pylint contributed to the present avalanche of energy and ideas.

Git has allowed me to revise Leo's source code radically, with complete safety. I would never have done what I have done lately with bzr.

Leo's new pylint command allows me to run pylint *easily* on one or more "recent" files, *without* having to change any list. As a result, I run pylint much more often.

P.P.S. Here is the script that checks that all text wrapper classes implement all required methods. This is, to the first approximation, the only type checking that Leo really needs. It will probably become a unit test.

@language python

    import leo.core.leoFrame as leoFrame
    import leo.plugins.qt_text as qt_text
    from leo.core.leoQt import Qsci,QtWidgets
    
    h = leoFrame.HighLevelInterface(c)
    w = Qsci.QsciScintilla()
    tw = QtWidgets.QTextBrowser()
    q = qt_text.QScintillaWrapper(widget=w,c=c,name='test')
    t = qt_text.QTextEditWrapper(widget=tw,name='test2')
    
    h_list = [z for z in sorted(dir(h)) if not z.startswith('__')]
    t_list = [z for z in sorted(dir(t)) if not z.startswith('__')]
    q_list = [z for z in sorted(dir(q)) if not z.startswith('__')]
    ignore = [
        'set_focus', # synonym for setFocus
        'mutable_methods', # To be removed.
    ]
    for z in h_list:
        if z not in t_list and z not in ignore:
            print('QTextEditWrapper: not in HighLevelInterface: %s' % z)
    for z in h_list:
        if z not in q_list and z not in ignore:
            print('QScintillaWrapper: not in HighLevelInterface: %s' % z)
    print('done')

=====

This project appears to be a complete success. No further work is planned. I have encountered no problems at all during this reorg, and don't expect any, but we shall see...

Here are the highlights:

1. *All* of the odious redirection code in Leo is gone.
 
The redirection code appeared in various places, especially in the HighLevelInterface class.

2. The HighLevelInterface class is gone: the LeoBody and LeoLog classes are now subclasses of object.

3. The logCtrl property is gone: the LeoLog class now defines a .logCtrl ivar.

This ivar is inherently tricky: depending on which log *tab* is selected, LeoLog.logCtrl may be either a wrapper or a widget!

Because LeoLog no longer contains redirection code a hack was needed. k.masterKeyHandler redirects text-related events originally sent to the c.frame.log to c.frame.log.logWidget, which, confusingly enough, is actually a text wrapper.

4. leoFrame.py contains several new API classes: ColorizerAPI, IconBarAPI, StatusLineAPI and WrapperAPI.

No class is a subclass of these classes: they are for unit testing only.

The new unit test, "@test interfaces using API classes", checks that classes implement all the methods in the corresponding API class. This is not a perfect solution and it is no substitute for pylint. Nevertheless, these API classes are good documentation, and they did result in a few new methods being added to each tested "Null" class.

Rev 060c33a contains a spectacular collapse in complexity in idle-time
handling.

Instantly, registering idle-time event handlers can be considered
deprecated, though I have no plans to remove the horrendous older code.

The new pattern allows multiple, independent (or cooperating) idle-time
handlers, created at will as needed.

The new code is based on the IdleTime class in qtGui.py. Rather than access
this directly, code should use the g.IdleTime proxy::

@language python

    def IdleTime(c,handler,delay=500):
        '''A proxy for the g.app.gui.IdleTime class.'''
        if g.app and g.app.gui and hasattr(g.app.gui,'idleTimeClass'):
            return g.app.gui.idleTimeClass(c,handler,delay)
        else:
            return None
            
@language rest

g.IdleTime ensures that all is well when using gui's that don't have an IdleTime class.

Here is how to use the new code::

@language python

    def handler(it):
        '''The IdleTime handler: called at idle time.'''
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace(it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),'%2.4f' % (delta_t))
        if it.count &gt;= 5:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    it = g.IdleTime(c,handler,delay=500)
    if it: it.start()
    
@language rest

The code creates an instance of the IdleTime class that calls the given
handler at idle time, and no more than once every 500 msec. Here is the
output::

    handler 1 ekr.leo 0.5100
    handler 2 ekr.leo 1.0300
    handler 3 ekr.leo 1.5400
    handler 4 ekr.leo 2.0500
    handler 5 ekr.leo 2.5610
    handler done

Timer instances are completely independent.  For example:

@language python

    def handler1(it):
        '''The IdleTime handler: called at idle time.'''
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace('%2s %s %2.4f' % (it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),delta_t))
        if it.count &gt;= 5:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    def handler2(it):
        '''The IdleTime handler: called at idle time.'''
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace('%2s %s %2.4f' % (it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),delta_t))
        if it.count &gt;= 10:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    it1 = g.IdleTime(c,handler1,delay=500)
    it2 = g.IdleTime(c,handler2,delay=1000)
    if it1 and it2:
        it1.start()
        it2.start()
        
@language rest

Here is the output::

    handler1  1 ekr.leo 0.5200
    handler2  1 ekr.leo 1.0100
    handler1  2 ekr.leo 1.0300
    handler1  3 ekr.leo 1.5400
    handler2  2 ekr.leo 2.0300
    handler1  4 ekr.leo 2.0600
    handler1  5 ekr.leo 2.5600
    handler1 done
    handler2  3 ekr.leo 3.0400
    handler2  4 ekr.leo 4.0600
    handler2  5 ekr.leo 5.0700
    handler2  6 ekr.leo 6.0800
    handler2  7 ekr.leo 7.1000
    handler2  8 ekr.leo 8.1100

It's easy to replace methods with classes.  Just add a __call__ method. Yes, several of Leo's commands are implemented this way. But read on...

Various vim commands advertise, by having a tab_callback method, that they want to handle a tab that follows their name. ga.do_tab then defers to the vim command. Vim's tab handler no longer knows *anything* about colon commands, or what any command intends to do with the tab! If the command handler has a tab_callback attribute, vim's tab handler just calls it!

Here is the flattened form of the class that handles the :tabnew command. Note that the __call__ and tab_callback methods are trivial::

@language python

class Tabnew:
    '''
    A class to handle Vim's :tabnew command.
    This class supports the do_tab callback.
    '''
    def __init__(self,vc):
        '''Ctor for VimCommands.tabnew class.'''
        self.vc = vc
    __name__ = ':tabnew'

<t tx="ekr.20150312080344.19">How did we ever live without this?

@data nodes, like @data qt-gui-plugin-style-sheet may now be composed of
the body text of the @data node itself, concatenated to the body text of
all its descendants, in outline order.

For example, @data qt-gui-plugin-style-sheet node consists of some general
comments, with descendant nodes for the body pane, tree pane, etc. etc.
There is no limit of nesting: the Plugins node has a child for each plugin
that uses style sheets.

Not only does this new arrangement make it far easier to find the style
sheet of interest, it makes debugging style sheets easier. Typically, an
error in any part of the style sheet invalidates the whole style sheet.
With the new organization, one can swap nodes into or out of the @data node
to find the invalid node or nodes.

Two fine points about the concatenation of data:

1. Descendant nodes whose headlines start with '@' do not become part of
   the data. At present, no @data nodes have descendants, but this
   convention does something reasonable if nodes like @int or @string were
   descendants of an @data node.

2. The @data parser adds a newline to every "fragment" if necessary. This
   doesn't seem to matter for style sheets, but it could matter for other
   kinds of @data data.

<t tx="ekr.20150312080344.20">The leo/plugins/importers folders now contains importer plugins.

The leo/plugins/writers folders now contain writer plugins.

Both importer and writer plugins can defined new kinds of @auto nodes.

Importers and writers can register either @auto-names or file extensions.
For example, @auto x.xyzzy will use both the importer and the writer for
the .xyzzy extension, that is, importers/test.py and writers/test.py. So,
for *unique* extensions, there is no need to use a separate @auto name, you
can just use @auto.

<t tx="ekr.20150312080344.21">After Alt-x puts you in the minibuffer, you can now use UpArrow and DownArrow keys to cycle through previous "complex" commands, that is, commands entered via Alt-x&lt;command-name&gt;&lt;return&gt;. For example, Alt-x UpArrow is roughly equivalent to Ctrl-p.

This fixes git bug 28: https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/28
Leo hangs when a node with too large body is selected

To see the effect of the new code:

1  Create a node with *lots* of colored text.
2. Move the cursor to the last line of the text.
3. Select another node, and then move back to the "big" node.

You should see the end of the text all in black at first, and then become
colored later.

In the meantime, Leo is responsive to all commands, mouse clicks, etc.

<t tx="ekr.20150312080344.28">In February 2015 I realized that the @shadow algorithm could be used to update @clean (aka @nosent) files. This inspired me to simplify the @shadow update algorithm. The Mulder/Ream algorithm emerged several days later.

Thinking of using Leo as a diff program may have been the line of thought that lead to @clean. It turned my attention to the @shadow algorithm, and that may have been enough to see that the algorithm could get sentinels from the .leo file instead of hidden shadow files.

I'll probably never be able to recreate a clearer picture of how the Aha came to be.  That's the nature of big Aha's: they obliterate previous ways of thought so completely that it's hard to remember the time before the Aha.

If the installer doesn't work (or puts up a dialog containing no text), you may install Leo from the .zip file as described at `How to install Leo on Windows`_. However you are installing Leo, be sure to `run Leo in a console window`_. because as a last resort Leo prints error messages to the console.

<t tx="ekr.20150313053238.44">I just want to provide my own thoughts about the importance of @clean. I look at the posts in this group a fair amount because I find the discussion interesting but I had abandoned leo as a day-to-day tool principally because of the sentinels in @file nodes. Even for solo projects, I just found them visually unappealing and beyond that occasionally confusing when I went to edit files with external editors. I would sometimes start a project in leo, particularly if it was based on code I developed in the past using leo, and then would use the old @nosent to save a version of the code without sentinels and then use my external editor of choice and not use leo at all. I missed many of the features of leo but just couldn't get over the sentinel issue.

@clean really seems to solve all the issues that I had. In particular--and somehow this point doesn't seem to me to have been emphasized enough--it seems to fully support organizer nodes. They are one of the great things about leo--it's happy to guess initially at what the structure of your program is but it's completely up to you to determine the structure and the ability to do things like break up long methods, group like methods, group menu actions in GUI code, etc etc is one of the very cool things about leo. My limited but growing experience with @clean's handling of external changes has been mainly with incremental (as opposed to more sweeping) code changes, and the assignment of new lines is reasonable and you can always fix them it quickly if you don't like how external changes have been handled.

There have been some posts about the recovered nodes, comparing the old and new nodes where there were external changes. I think it's genius. As opposed to hoping that leo has correctly incorporated external changes, it's all there in case you want to take a closer look. Without this, I would just not have the confidence that external changes were being applied correctly and while you can always do a git diff, I am not looking to do that every time I change a file externally especially if I am not at the point where I am about to do a commit.

There has been some discussion of @auto v. @clean. Preference is obviously a matter of taste. I will say that for me the fact that node headlines are unaffected by external file changes is a feature not a problem since I place notes in the headlines that I want preserved when I edit files externally. Yes, if the node headlines are the method names then they won't be updated if an external edit changes a method name but this was true of @file as well.

The ability to work on projects with people who don't have leo is obvious; one perhaps slightly less obvious benefit of no sentinels is that I suspect that the likelihood that someone will clone a git repository is reduced when that repository's code is riddled with leo sentinels (unless the potential cloner is a leo loyalist). The one downside to no sentinels--there is no evidence that leo is being used but I think that raises the broader question of marketing leo, which I certainly believe will be aided significantly by being able to take advantage of leo without sentinels in external files.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150313053238.45">.. _`import script`: tutorial-scripting.html#import-scripts
.. _git: http://git-scm.com/

@clean is the long-sought breakthrough that just might allow Leo to "go viral". For the very first time, Leo can be used in *all* situations without compromise.  There is no longer any need to make excuses for sentinel lines, or argue whether people should accept them.  Sentinels are simply gone.

I have just realized how inconvenient sentinels might be for my *own* work flow.  This was a shocking revelation.  To illustrate, here is an excerpt from the programming tutorial:

When I study other people's code I do the following:

- Create a git repo of the directory to be studied, adding all the source files and doing an initial commit.
 
- Use an `import script`_ to create the desired @clean nodes.

- Explicitly save all the imported files using Ctrl-Shift-W (write-at-file-nodes).

- Use `git`_ diff to ensure that no important changes have been made while importing the nodes.

- Use git diff to track any changes I make (such as adding tracing or debugging statements) for the purposes of studying the code. Using @clean is an essential part of this work flow. The diffs would be much harder to read if I had imported files into @file trees instead.

In short, I have just now realized how badly sentinels interfered with git diffs.

``advertised-undo``

Leo supports unlimited undo and redo with the ``undo`` (Ctrl-Z) and ``redo`` (Ctrl-Shift-Z) commands. Think of actions that may be undone or redone as a string of beads. A "bead pointer" points to the present bead. Performing an operation creates a new bead after the present bead and removes all following beads. Undoing an operation moves the bead pointer backwards; redoing an operation moves the bead pointer forwards. The ``undo`` command is disabled when the bead pointer moves in front of the first bead; the ``redo`` command is disabled when the bead pointer points to the last bead.

The @string undo_granularity setting controls the granularity of undo. There are four possible values:

``node``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to a new node.

``line (default)``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to new line.

``word``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing starts a new word.

``char`` (not recommended)
    Starts a new undo unit for each character typed.
    This wastes lots of computer memory.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.21">``cut-text (Ctrl-X)``
    Cut the selected text and put it to the clipboard.
``copy-text (Ctrl-C)``
    Copy the selected text to the clipboard.
``paste-text (Ctrl-V)``
    Paste test from the clipboard.

These commands work with either headline or body text.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.22">.. revise

The ``indent-region`` (Tab) and ``unindent-region`` (Shift-Tab) commands
shift selected lines in the body text left or right one tab position. These
commands shift the entire line if any characters in that line are selected.
If no text is selected, the Tab character insert a hard or soft tab
depending on the value of the @tabwidth directive in effect.

**Notes**: Leo auto indents unless @nocolor is in effect.  Typing a newline automatically inserts the same leading whitespace present on the previous line.

If Python is the present language, Leo inserts an additional tab if the previous line ends with a colon.  When the smart_auto_indent setting is True, Leo uses Emacs-style auto-indentation instead.  This style of auto-indent aligns newly created lines with unmatched ( [ or { brackets in the previous line.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.23">``add-comments (Ctrl-))``
    Adds comments to the selected lines, using single-line comments if possible.
``delete-comments (Ctrl-()``
    Deletes comments in the selected lines.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.24">``clean-lines``
    Removes trailing whitespace from all lines, preserving newlines. 
``convert-tabs``
    Converts leading tabs to blanks in a single node.
``convert-blanks``
    Cconverts blanks to tabs in a single node.
``convert-all-tabs``
    Converts leading tabs to blanks throughout the selected tree.
``convert-all-blanks``
    Converts leading blanks to tabs throughout the selected tree.
    
**@tabwidth**: The ``convert-*`` commands convert between tabs and blanks using the @tabwidth setting presently in effect.

``pretty-print-python-code`` and ``pretty-print-all-python-code``
    Pretty prints body text. You can customize this code by overriding the following methods of class prettyPrinter in leoCommands.py::

        putOperator:      puts whitespace around operators.
        putNormalToken:   puts whitespace around everything else.

``reformat-paragraph (Ctrl-Shift-P)``
    Rearranges the words in a text paragraph to fill each line as full as possible, up to the @pagewidth setting. A paragraph is delimited by blank lines, Leo directives, and (of course) start and end of text in a node. The width of the line used by the reformatting operation is governed by @pagewidth and the indentation that would be applied to the node when Leo writes the file.

The command operates on the paragraph containing the insert cursor. If the insert cursor is on a blank line or directive, nothing happens. If the cursor is on a line containing text, then the paragraph containing that text line is reformatted and the insert cursor is moved to the next paragraph.

**Note**: Hanging indentation is preserved. This is most useful for bulleted or numbered lists, such as::

  1. This is the first paragraph,
     and it has a hanging indentation.

  2. This is the second paragraph,
     and it too has a hanging indentation.
     
``unformat-paragraph (Ctrl-Shift-U)``
    Removes all extra whitespace from a paragraph, including leading whitespace.  This command is useful when @wrap is in effect.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.25">``extract (Ctrl-Shift-D)``
    Creates a new node whose headline is the first line of selected body text and whose body is all other lines of selected text. Previously selected text is deleted from the original body text.
``extract-names (Ctrl-Shift-N)``
    Creates one or more child nodes, one for each section name in the selected body text. The headline of each created node is the section name.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.26">.. revise

The ``execute-script`` (Ctrl-B) command executes body text as a Python script. Leo execute the selected text, or the entire body text if no text is selected. The Execute Script command pre-defines the values c, g and p as follows:

- c is the commander of the outline containing the script.
- g is the leoGlobals modules.
- p is c.p, that is, c.currentPosition().

**Important**: Body text may contain Leo directives and section references. You can use all of Leo's features to organize scripts that you execute interactively. Section definitions must appear in the node containing the script or in descendant nodes.

Leo preprocesses all scripts by simulating the writing of a external file to a string. The ``execute-script`` command sets app.scriptDict["script1"] to the value of the script before preprocessing, and sets app.scriptDict["script2"] to the value of the script after preprocessing. Scripts may examine and change app.scriptDict as they please.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.27">``add-editor``
    Adds a new editor in the body pane and gives it the body editor focus.
``delete-editor``
    Deletes the editor with body editor focus.
``cycle-editor-focus``
    Cycles body editor focus between editors in the body text. The editor that has focus shows the content of the selected outline node; the other body editors continue to show the node contents they last had when they had the body editor focus.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.28">``clear-selected-text``
    Delete the selected text.
``goto-global-line (Alt-G)``
    Selects the locations in your outlines corresponding to a line in a external file.
``insert-body-time`` and ``insert-headline-time``
    Insert formatted time and date into body or headline text. You must be editing a headline to be able to insert the time/date into the headline. The body_time_format_string and headline_time_format_string settings specify the format of the inserted text. These settings are the format string passed to time.strftime. For a complete list of the format options see http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html The "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S" format is used by default, resulting in a time/date format like::

        1/30/2003 8:31:55

``match-brackets``
    Enabled if the cursor is next to one of these characters in the body pane: ``( ) [ ] { } &lt; &gt;`` The command looks for the matching character, searching backwards through the body text if the cursor is next to ``)`` ``]`` ``}`` or ``&gt;`` and searching forward through the text otherwise. If the cursor is between two brackets the search is made for the bracket matching the leftmost bracket. If a match is found, the entire range of characters delimited by the brackets is highlighted and the cursor is placed just to the left of the matching characters. Thus, executing this command twice highlights the range of matched characters without changing the cursor.
``replace-current-character``
     Replace the selected character with the next character typed.
``toggle-angle-brackets``
    Adds or removes double angle brackets from the headline of the selected node.</t>

    Same as ``save-file-as``, compressing the .leo file with Python's zipfile module.
``save-file-as-unzipped``
    Same as ``save-as``, suppressing compression.


**About compression**: The ``save-file``, ``save-file-as`` and ``save-file-to`` commands compress the file if it was originally compressed. Leo always uses the .leo extension, regardless of whether the file is zipped. Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose name is the same as the .leo file itself. Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or other program to expand the .leo file contained within.

**About sessions**: An @session node specifies a list of tabs (.leo files) that Leo opens automatically when Leo first starts. The ``--session-save`` and ``--session-restore`` command-line options write and read @session nodes from the leo.session file. The next time Leo is started with those options, the files will be open, and the nodes focused as when the previous session ended.

``clone-node-to-last-node``
    Creates a clone as the last top-level node of the outline.
``insert-node (Ctrl-I or Insert)``

``insert-node-before``
    Inserts a node before the presently selected node.
``delete-node``
    Deletes a node and all its descendants.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.47">**Arrow keys**: When focus is in the outline pane, ou can move about the outline using *plain* arrow keys. Regardless of focus, Alt-Arrow keys select nodes in the outline pane.

``goto-first-sibling``
    Select the first sibling of the selected node.

<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.48">``copy-node (Ctrl-Shift-C)``
    Copies a node and all its descendants to the clipboard
``cut-node (Ctrl-Shift-X)``
    Copies a node and all its descendants to the clipboard and then delete them.
``delete-node``
    Deletes a node and all its descendants.
``paste-node (Ctrl-Shift-V)``
    Pastes a node and its descendants from the outline. This commands creates *copies* of nodes, not clones.
``past-retaining-clones``
    Pastes a node and its descendants from the outline.  This command preserves the identify (gnx's) of the pasted nodes, thereby preserving any clone links. This command ensures that no newly-pasted node is an ancestor of itself.

**Outline representation**: When cutting or copying an outine to the clipboard, Leo writes the outline in the same xml (text) format used in .leo files. You may copy this text representation into a body pane (or into any other text editor) using ``Ctrl-V``.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.49">``move-outline-down (Ctrl-D or Shift-Down or Alt-Shift-Down)``
    Move the selected node down, if possible.
``move-outline-left (Ctrl-L or Shift-Left or Alt-Shift-Left)``
    Move the selected node left, if possible.
``move-outline-right (Ctrl-R or Shift-Right or Alt-Shift-Right)`` 
    Move the selected node right, if possible.
``move-outline-up (Ctrl-U or Shift-Up Alt-Shift-Up)``
    Move the selected node up, if possible.

**Alt Modifiers not needed in the outline pane**: When focus is in the outline pane, you can move nodes without adding the Alt modifier. Shift-Up moves the select node up, etc.

**Important**: The following commands reorganize groups of nodes:

``de-hoist``
    Undoes the effect of the previous ``hoist`` command.
``demote (Ctrl-])``
    Makes all following siblings of a node children of the node.
``hoist``
    Redraws the screen so presently selected tree becomes the only visible part of the outline. You may hoist an outline as many times as you wish.
``promote (Ctrl-[)``
    Makes all the children of a node siblings of the node.
``sort-children``
    Sort all children of the children of the present node by their headlines.
``sort-siblings (Alt-A)``
    Sort the present node and all its siblings by their headlines.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.50">``code-to-rst``
    Format the presently selected node as computer code.
``flatten-outline-to-node``
    Appends the headline and body text of all descendants of the selected node to the body text of the selected node.
``head-to-prev-node``
    Moves non-empty text preceding a class, method or function definition to the end of the previous sibling node.
``parse-body``
    Parse p.b as source code, creating a tree of descendant nodes.
    This is essentially an import of p.b.
``tail-to-next-node``
    Moves non-empty text following a class, method or function definition to the start of the next sibling node.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.51">You may drag a node (including all its descendants) from one place to another in an outline. To start a drag, press the main (left) mouse button while the cursor is over the icon for a node. The cursor will change to a hand icon. If you release the mouse button while the hand cursor is above another node, Leo will move the dragged node after that node. If you release the mouse button when the hand cursor is not over a node, Leo will leave the outline pane as it is. Leo scrolls the outline pane as the result of mouse-moved events, so to continue scrolling you must keep moving the mouse.

If the recipient node has children and is expanded, the dropped node will be inserted as the first child of the recipient node, otherwise the dropped node will be inserted after the recipient node.

Holding down Alt before releasing the node will force insertion as a child of the recipient node, even if the recipient node is not expanded. Holding down Control before releasing the node will cause a clone to be dropped, leaving the original where it was.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.52">``goto-next-marked``
    Selects the next marked node.
``mark (Ctrl-M)``
    Marks node if it is unmarked, and unmarks the node if it is already marked.
``mark-changed-items``
    Marks all nodes whose headline or body text has been changed since the file was last saved.
``mark-subheads``
    Marks all children of the presently selected node.
``marked-list``
    Lists all marked nodes in the Nav pane.
``unmark-all``
    Unmarks all marked nodes in the outline.

**Marking groups of nodes**: Leo's find and change commands mark nodes if the "Mark Changes" and "Mark Finds" checkboxes are checked. You can change these checkboxes with the ``toggle-find-mark-changes-option`` and ``toggle-find-mark-finds-option`` commands.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.53">``clone-marked-nodes``
    Makes clones of all marked nodes and moves them to be children of the present position.
``delete-marked-nodes``
    Deletes all marked nodes.
``move-marked-nodes``
    Moves all nodes to be children of the present position.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.54">``file-compare-leo-files``
    Prompts for another (presumably similar) .leo file that will be compared with the presently selected outline file (main window). It then creates clones of all inserted, deleted and changed nodes.
``file-diff-files``
    Creates a node and puts the diff between 2 files into it. 
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.55">Chapters are sub-outlines rooted in an @chapter node. @chapter nodes should be children of an @chapters node. Selecting a chapter makes only those nodes in the chapter visible, much like a hoist. The ``main`` chapter represents the entire outline. Selecting the ``main`` chapter is much like a de-hoist command.

``chapter-clone-node-to``
    Moves a clone of the selected node to another chapter.
``chapter-convert-node-to``
    Makes the selected node into a new chapter, 'in place'. That is, it creates the new @chapter node as the next sibling of the node, then moves the node as the first child of the new @chapter node. 
``chapter-copy-node-to``
    Moves a copy of the selected node to another chapter.
``chapter-create``
    Creates an @chapter node and populates it with a single node.
``chapter-create-from-node``
    Creates an @chapter node from a node and its descendants.
``chapter-move-node-to``
    Moves the selected node to another chapter.
``chapter-remove``
    Deletes the currently selected chapter.
``chapter-rename``
    Renames the present chapter.
``chapter-select``
    Prompts for a chapter name selects that chapter, hiding all other nodes.

Associated settings:

``@bool use_chapters``
    True: chapters are enabled.
``@bool use_chapter_tabs``
    True: chapters pop-up menu appears in the icon area.

From: Terry Brown &lt;terry_n_brown@yahoo.com&gt;

I just pushed two new commands, zoom-in and zoom-out, which increase
or decrease the body text font size by one point size.  They probably
deserve default bindings, but to what?  I have them on Ctrl-; and Ctrl-'

They leverage the new theme "engine" by manipulating a constant
"@font-size-body".  I've set it up in the default theme, anyone using
the new dark theme will need to add

   @font-size-body = 18px

in the config node for that theme, 

@settings--&gt;solarized_dark theme settings--&gt;stylesheet &amp; source--&gt;config

and replace the literal "18px" with "@font-size-body" in the node

@settings--&gt;solarized_dark theme settings--&gt;stylesheet &amp; source--&gt;Non-color styles (fonts etc.)--&gt;body editor

commit log:

  zoom-in / zoom-out commands
  ctrl-mouse wheel scrolling for same
  
  replace old focused pane border highlight with pure stylesheet
  version
  
  rename solarized_dark theme leo_dark_0

1. The @data abbreviations-subst-env node contains a script defining the environment in which all abbreviations execute. This allows helper functions to be defined. Very handy.
   
2. Scripts may span multiple lines. Line starting with "\:" (2 characters) continue a script. This allows abbreviations to define multi-line templates.  Helpers defined in @data abbreviations-subst-env can fill in templates with *calculated* (not predefined) data.
   
3. Templates may contain placeholders that the user can fill in.  By default, the double comma binding selects the next placeholder.

4. Added a new setting: @bool scripting-abbreviations, default False. Scripting abbreviations will be enabled if *either* of the following is True::

    @bool scripting-abbreviations
    @bool scripting-at-script-nodes
    
This is a safety feature: it allows scripting abbreviations to be enabled *without* enabling the (very dangerous in general) scripting-at-script-nodes setting.

5. Added a new example node: @@data abbreviations examples.  This contains
   several extremely useful scripts.

Python code.

    Deletes each line that contains a match for regexp, operating on the text after point.
    In Transient Mark mode, if the region is active, the command operates on the region instead.

<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.83">The quicksearch plugin now supports the go-anywhere command. It works "sort of" like Nav bar. Also Nav bar now does live search on headline (you have to press enter to force search of bodies as well)

Once the hits are shows, you can navigate them by pressing up/down while focus is still in line editor &amp; you can keep on typing (sort of like sublime text).

This has a very clever hack (even if I say so myself)--spaces in search string are replaced with * wild card. So if you search for, say "file txt", it will search for "file*txt", matching e.g. @file readme.txt

``back-to-home``
    Many editors allow you to jump over, select and delete words, especially those containing or surrounded by special characters, in a smarter way than just "going to the beginning of the word before" (back-word) or "going to the end of the next word" (forward-word).

Patches add "-smart" equivalents of the jump, select and delete commands.
Users wanting to use these commands can set in their myLeoSettings.leo::

  back-word-smart                  = Ctrl-LtArrow
  back-word-smart-extend-selection = Ctrl-Shift-LtArrow

  forward-word-smart                  = Ctrl-RtArrow
  forward-word-smart-extend-selection = Ctrl-Shift-RtArrow

  delete-word-smart          = Ctrl-Delete
  backward-delete-word-smart = Ctrl-BackSpace
</t>

Given::

    I'm really glad the docs are being updated. I know that's a
    monumental task. I only use a fraction of Leo's commands, mostly
    because I don't even know what they're supposed to accomplish. A few
    examples:

Placing the cursor immediately before the first "I", holding shift and
moving it to immediately before the word "examples" selects a zero
width rectangle from the beginning to the end of the selection (zero
width because the selection starts and ends in the same column.  Then
running rectangle-string "[largo]&lt;space&gt;&lt;enter&gt;" yields:

- Document the plugin thoroughly in the plugin's docstring. This allows the documentation to be accessed from the Plugins menu.
  
- Document any new commands with a proper docstring. This allows the minibuffer command `help-for-command` to provide help for the command.
  
- In `leo/doc/sphinx-docs/sphinxDocs.leo`, to the node `@file leo.plugins.rst`, add the following snippet (preferably in alphabetical order), with the name of the plugin modified to the name of your plugin (here `ipython`). This allows the API docs to be automatically updated::

<t tx="shadow.20080825171547.9">**Question**: I must follow a coding standard when writing source code. It includes a maximum line length restriction. How can I know the length of a line when it gets written to the external file?

**Answer**: If a node belongs to a external file hierarchy, its body might get indented when it is written to the external file. It happens when an @others directive or a section name appears indented in a higher-level node body. While (**line**, **col**) in status area show the line and column containing the body text's cursor, **fcol** shows the cursor coordinate relative to the external file, not to the current node. The relation **fcol &gt;= col** is always true.

<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.1">Leo's ``--ipython`` command-line option enables two-way communication (**ILeo**, the **IPython bridge**) between Leo and IPython: you can run Leo scripts from IPython, and IPython scripts from Leo.

The level of integration is much deeper than conventional integration in IDEs. Most notably, you are able to store and manipulate *data* in Leo nodes, in addition to mere program code--essentially making ILeo a hierarchical spreadsheet, albeit with non-grid view of the data. The possibilities of this are endless, and the approach can be applied in wide range of problem domains with very little actual coding.
</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.2">To run Leo's IPython bridge:

1. Install IPython 0.8.3 or above.

2. `run Leo in a console window`_ with the ``--ipython`` command-line option
   enabled. This option starts an instance of the IPython shell in the
   console. Leo and IPython run simultaneously and independently. Their
   separate event loops do not interfere with each other.

   The ipython-new command launches new terminals connected to the same
   IPython kernel.</t>
