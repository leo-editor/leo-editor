<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.140">Leo stores options in **@settings trees**, outlines whose headline is @settings. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files. This scheme allows for the following kinds of settings:

- Per-installation or per-machine settings.
- Per-user settings.
- Per-folder settings.
- Per-file settings.

There are four kinds of settings files:

1. **Default settings files**, named **leoSettings.leo**. Although they can be used in other ways, they typically contain default settings.

2. **Personal settings files**, named **myLeoSettings.leo**. They provide a way of ensuring that your customized settings are not altered when updating Leo from git or while installing a new version of Leo. The myLeoSettings.leo acts much like Python's site-customize.py file. myLeoSettings.leo will never be part of any Leo distribution, and it will never exist in Leo's cvs repository. This solution is *much* better than trying to update leoSettings.leo with scripts.

3. **Machine settings files**, named **LeoSettings.leo** (note the capital 'L'), and appearing in a unique directory.

4. **Theme files**. These are .leo files containing stylesheets and other appearance-related settings.

The following sections describe the kinds of nodes in @settings trees.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.224" str_atime="1376412038.0">Naively using plugins can expose you and your .leo files to malicious attacks. The fundamental principles are::

    Scripts and plugins must never blindly execute code from untrusted sources.

and::

    .leo files obtained from other people may potentially contain hostile code.

Stephen Schaefer summarizes the danger this way::

    I foresee a future in which the majority of leo projects come from
    marginally trusted sources...a world of leo documents sent hither
    and yon - resumes, project proposals, textbooks, magazines,
    contracts - and as a race of Pandora's, we cannot resist wanting
    to see "What's in the box?" And are we going to fire up a text
    editor to make a detailed examination of the ASCII XML? Never!
    We're going to double click on the cute leo file icon, and leo
    will fire up in all its raging glory. Just like Word (and its
    macros) or Excel (and its macros).

In other words::

    When we share "our" .leo files we can NOT assume that we know what
    is in our "own" documents!

Not all environments are untrustworthy. Code in a commercial cvs repository is probably trustworthy: employees might be terminated for posting malicious code. Still, the potential for abuse exists anywhere.

In Python it is very easy to write a script that will blindly execute other scripts::

    # Warning: extremely dangerous code

    # Execute the body text of all nodes that start with `@script`.
    def onLoadFile():
        for p in c.all_positions():
            h = p.h.lower()
            if g.match_word(h,0,"@script"):
                s = p.b
                if s and len(s) &gt; 0:
                    try: # SECURITY BREACH: s may be malicious!
                        exec(s + '\n')
                    except:
                        es_exception()

Executing this kind of code is typically an intolerable security risk. **Important**: rexec provides *no protection whatever*. Leo is a repository of source code, so any text operation is potentially malicious. For example, consider the following script, which is valid in rexec mode::

    badNode = c.p
    for p in c.all_positions():
        &lt;&lt; change `rexec` to `exec` in p's body &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; delete badNode &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; clear the undo stack &gt;&gt;

This script will introduce a security hole the .leo file without doing anything prohibited by rexec, and without leaving any traces of the perpetrating script behind. The damage will become permanent *outside* this script when the user saves the .leo file.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.240" str_atime="1376411987.0">If a plugin has a function at the outer (module) level called unitTest, Leo's unit tests will call that function.

So it would be good if writers of plugins would create such a unitTest function. To indicate a failure the unitTest can just throw an exception. Leo's plugins test suite takes care of the rest.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.248">The following sections describe the complexities that were involved in designing Leo's simple-looking mechanisms. They give a pseudo-chronological list of the major Aha's involved in creating Leo2. These Aha's form the real design and theory of operation of Leo. 

I am writing these notes for several reasons. First, the initial design and coding of Leo2, spanning a period of about 8 weeks, was some of the most creative and rewarding work I have ever done. The result is elegant and simple. I'm proud of it. Second, much of the design work is not reflected in the code, because improved design often eliminated code entirely. The final code is so elegant that it obscures the hard work that created it. Third, you must understand this design in order to understand the implementation of @file trees and their external files. Someday someone else may take charge of Leo. That person should know what really makes Leo work.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.249">In the summer of 2001 I began work on a project that for a long time I had considered impossible. I had long considered that "private" file formats such as .leo files were the only way to represent an outline properly and safely. I'm not sure what changed my mind, but I finally was willing to consider that information embedded in external files might be useful. This meant accepting the possibility that sentinel lines might be corrupted. This was a crucial first step. If we can trust the user not to corrupt sentinel lines than we can embed almost any kind of information into a external file.

There were several motivations for this work. I wanted to eliminate the need for explicit Tangle and Untangle commands. I thought of this as "Untangle on Read/Tangle on Write." If tangling and untangling could be made automatic it would save the user a lot of work. I also wanted to make external files the primary sources files. .leo files might be made much smaller external files contained the primary source information. This hope turned out to be false.

The result of this design work was something I originally called Leo2. Now, I prefer to talk about @file trees. Initially most design issues were unresolved or unknown. I resolved to attempt a robust error-recovery scheme, not knowing in advance what that might involve. I also wanted to solve what I thought of as the "cross-file clone" problem: clones that point from a .leo outline into a external file. With Leo1 cross-file clones do not exist; everything is in the same .leo file. It was clear that Leo2 would have to change some aspects of clones, but all details were fuzzy.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.250">The next step was also crucial. I started to use Leo1 as a prototype to design what the new body pane would look like to the user. In retrospect, using Leo1 as a prototype for Leo2 was just as inspired as using MORE as a prototype for Leo1. Both prototypes marked the true beginning of their respective projects. The Leo2 prototype was a mockup in Python of the code for reading and writing derived files.

Writing the prototype got me thinking about improving noweb. With my experience with Leo1, I was able to create a new markup language that took advantage of outline structure. I called the new language "simplified noweb", though that terminology is obsolete. I created @file nodes to distinguish between the old and new ways of creating external files. In Leo1, the @code directive is simply an abbreviation for a section definition line. Simplified noweb used @c as an abbreviation for @code. More importantly, simplified noweb used @c to separate doc parts from code parts without necessarily specifying a section name. It quickly became apparent that most nodes could be unnamed. All I needed was the @others directive to specify the location for all such unnamed nodes.

From the start, simplified noweb was a joy to use. The @others directive could replace all section definition lines. Furthermore, I could make @doc directive optional if the body pane started in "code mode". But this meant that plain body text could become a program! This was an amazing discovery. These Aha's got me excited about Leo2. This was important, as it motivated me to do a lot of difficult design work.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.251">In spite of this excitement, I was uneasy. After much "daydreaming" I realized that I was afraid that reading and writing external files would be interrupted by a long series of alerts. I saw that designing the "user interaction" during reading and writing would be very important. The next Aha was that I could replace a long series of alerts with messages to the log window, followed by a single "summary" alert. Much later I saw how to eliminate alerts entirely.

At this time I thought there would be two kinds of "errors" while reading external files. Warnings would alert the user that something non-serious had happened. True errors would alert the user that data might have been lost. Indeed, if Leo2 saves orphan and ignored nodes in a .leo file under an @file node, then read errors could endanger such nodes. Much later I saw that a robust error recovery scheme demands that @file nodes not contain orphan and @ignored nodes. (More on this subject later.) But if orphan and @ignored nodes are moved out of @file trees, there are no read errors that can cause data loss! So the distinction between warnings and errors finally went away.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.252">I next turned my attention to writing @file nodes. A huge Aha: I realized that sentinel lines must contain both a leading and a trailing newline. The general principle is this: the write code must contain absolutely no "conditional" logic, because otherwise the read code could not figure out whether the condition should be true or false. So external files contain blank lines between sentinel lines. These "extra" newlines are very useful, because the read (untangle) code can now easily determine exactly where every blank, tab and newline of the external file came from. It would be hard to overstate how important this simplifying principle was in practice.

Much later, with urging from a customer, I realized that the write code could safely remove "extra" newlines between sentinels with a caching scheme in the low level atFile::os() routine. This scheme does not alter the body of the write code in any way: in effect, sentinels still contain leading and trailing "logical" newlines. The read code had to be modified to handle "missing" leading newlines, but this can always be done assuming that sentinels still contain logical leading and trailing newlines!

At about this time I designed a clever way of having the write code tell the read code which newlines were inserted in doc parts. (The whole point of doc parts is to have the write code format long comments by splitting long lines.) To quote from my diary:

"We can use the following convention to determine where putDocPart has inserted line breaks: A line in a doc part is followed by an inserted newline if and only if the newline is preceded by whitespace. This is an elegant convention, and is essentially invisible to the user. Tangle outputs words until the line would become too long, and then it inserts a newline. To preserve all whitespace, tangle always includes the whitespace that terminates a word on the same line as the word itself. Therefore, split lines always end in whitespace. To make this convention work, tangle only has to delete the trailing whitespace of all lines that are followed by a 'real' newline."
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.253">After the write code was working I turned my attention to the read (untangle) code. Leo's Untangle command is the most complex and difficult code I have ever written. Imagine my surprise when I realized that the Leo2 read code is essentially trivial! Indeed, the Leo2 untangle code is like an assembler. The read code scans lines of a external files looking for "opcodes", that is, sentinel lines, and executes some simple code for each separate opcode. The heart of this code is the scanText routine in atFile.cpp.

The read code was written and debugged in less than two days! It is the most elegant code I have ever written. While perfecting the read code I realized that sentinel lines should show the complete nesting structure found in the outline, even if this information seems redundant. For example, I was tempted to use a single sentinel to represent an @other directive, but finally abandoned this plan in favor of the @+other and @-other sentinels.

This redundancy greatly simplified the read code and made the structure of external files absolutely clear. Moreover, it turned out that we need, in general, all the information created by the present sentinel lines. In short, sentinels are as simple as they can be, and no simpler.

The atFile::createNthChild method is a very important: it ensures that nodes will be correctly inserted into the outline. createNthChild must be bullet-proof if the Read code is to be robust. Note that the write code outputs @node sentinels, that is, section definitions, in the order in which sections are referenced in the outline, not the order in which sections appear in the outline. So createNthChild must insert the n'th node of parent p properly even if p contains fewer than n-1 children! The write code ensures that section references are properly nested: @node sentinels are enclosed in @node sentinels for all their ancestors in the @file tree. createNthChild creates dummy siblings as needed, then replaces the dummy siblings later when their actual definitions, that is, @node sentinels, are encountered.

At this point the fundamental read/write code was complete. I found three minor bugs in the code over the next week or so, but it was clear that the read/write code formed a rock-solid base from which to continue design and implementation. This was an entirely unexpected surprise.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.254">At this point I could read and write external files "by hand", using temporary Read and Write commands. The next step was to integrate the reading and writing of external files with the loading and saving of .leo files. From time to time I made minor changes to the drivers for the read/write code to accommodate the Load and Save code, but at no time did I significantly alter the read or write code itself.

The user interaction of the Load and Save commands drove the design and implementation of the load/store code. The most important questions were: "what do we tell the user?", and "what does the user do with the information?" It turns out that the user can't make any complex decision during error recovery because the user doesn't have nearly enough information to make an informed choice. In turn, this means that certain kinds of error recovery schemes are out of the question...
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.255">I now turned my attention to "attributes" of nodes. Most attributes, like user marks, are non-essential. However, clone information is essential; we must never lose clone links. At this time I had a preliminary design for cross-file clones that involved a two part "pointer" consisting of a full path name and an immutable clone index within the external file. Eventually such pointers completely disappeared, but the immutable clone indices remain.

My first thought was that it would be good to store all attributes in @node sentinels in the external file, but experience showed that would be irritating. Indeed, one wants Leo2 to rewrite external files only if something essential has changed. For example, one doesn't want to rewrite the external file just because a different node as been selected.

At this point I had another Aha: we can use the .leo file to store all non-essential attributes. For example, this means that the .leo file, not the external files, will change if we select a new node. In effect, the .leo file mirrors the external file. The only reason to store nodes in the .leo file under an @file node is to carry these attributes, so Leo2 wrote dummy nodes that do not reference body text. Much later I saw that dummy nodes were dangerous and that .leo files should contain all information found in external files.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.256">The concept of mirroring created a huge breakthrough with cross-file clones: Here is an excerpt of an email i sent to my brother Speed:

"I realized this morning that since a .leo file contains dummy vnodes for all nodes in a external file, those dummy nodes can carry clone info! I changed one line to make sure that the write code always writes clone info in dummy vnodes and voila! Cross-file clones worked!"

All of Leo1's clone code could be used completely unchanged. Everything "just works".
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.257">At first I thought we could make sure that the .leo file always correctly mirrors all external file, but disastrous experience showed that is a completely false hope. Indeed, backup .leo files will almost never mirror external file correctly. So it became urgent to find a completely fool-proof error recovery scheme.

I had known for quite a while that error recovery should work "as if" the mirroring nodes were deleted, then recreated afresh. Several failed attempts at an error recovery scheme convinced me that error recovery would actually have to delete all dummy nodes and then do a complete reread. This is what Leo2 does.

But erasing dummy nodes would destroy any orphan and ignored nodes--by definition such nodes appear nowhere in the external file. Therefore, I had to enforce the rule that @file nodes should contain no such nodes. Here is an email I wrote to my brother, Speed Ream discussing what turned out to be the penultimate error recovery scheme:

"The error recovery saga continues. After much pondering and some trial coding I have changed my mind about orphans and @ignored nodes. They simply should never appear as descendants of @file nodes. Fortunately, this simplifies all aspects of Leo2. Leo2 will issue a warning (not an error) if an orphan or @ignored node appears as the descendant of an @file node when a .leo file is being saved. If any warnings occur while writing the external file, Leo2 will write the "offending" @file tree to the .leo file instead of the external file. This has several advantages:

1. The user gets warned about orphan nodes. These are useful warnings! Orphan nodes arise from missing @others directives or missing section references.

2. The user doesn't have to change anything immediately in order to save an outline. This is very important. Besides warnings about orphans, Leo2 will also warn about undefined or unreferenced sections. User's shouldn't have to fix these warnings to do a Save!

3. No errors or alerts will occur during Reading or Writing, so the user's anxiety level goes way down. At worst, some informational message will be sent to the log. The user will never have to make important decisions during Loads or Saves. [At last the dubious distinction between errors and warnings disappears.]

4. Error recovery can be bullet-proof. Simple code will guarantee that after any read operation the structure of an @file node will match the structure of the external file. Also, sentinels in external files will now account for all children of an @file node. There are no more "missing nodes" that must be filled in using the .leo file. Finally, error recovery will never change the @file tree in any way: no more "recovered nodes" nodes.

5. The present read code can be used almost unchanged. The only addition is the posting of a warning if the structure of the .leo file does not match the structure of the external file. We need a warning because non-essential attribute of nodes (like user marks) may be altered."

This ends the original history of Leo2. In fact, it took quite a while before Leo recovered properly from all errors. I finally saw that .leo files should duplicate all information in external files. This allows a .leo file to be used a single backup file and allows maximal error recovery in all situations. It took several months to stamp out several subtle bugs involving clones that caused spurious read errors. Such errors undermine confidence in Leo and can cause disastrous reversions. See my diary entries for January 2002 in leo.py for details.

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.268">Leo's grand strategy for handling text is as follows:

1. Internally, Leo uses unicode objects for all text.

2. When reading files or user input, Leo converts all plain (encoded)
   strings to unicode.

3. When reading or writing files, Leo converts unicode strings to encoded
   strings.
   
To make this strategy work, Leo must know the encoding used for external files. This is why Leo supports the @encoding directive and various encoding-related settings.

The g.toUnicode and g.toEncodedString functions convert to and from unicode. These methods catch all unicode-related exceptions.

The g.u function should be used *only* to convert from the Qt string type (a wrapper for a unicode string) to unicode. Do not use g.u instead of g.toUnicode.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.354">Leo uses unicode internally for all strings.

1. Leo converts headline and body text to unicode when reading .leo files and external files. Both .leo files and external files may specify their encoding.  The default is utf-8. If the encoding used in a external file is not "utf-8" it is represented in the @+leo sentinel line. For example::

        #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

    The utf-8 encoding is a "lossless" encoding (it can represent all
    unicode code points), so converting to and from utf-8 plain
    strings will never cause a problem. When reading or writing a
    character not in a "lossy" encoding, Leo converts such characters
    to '?' and issues a warning.

2. When writing .leo files and external files Leo uses the same encoding used to read the file, again with utf-8 used as a default.

3. leoSettings.leo contains the following Unicode settings, with the defaults as shown::

        default_derived_file_encoding = UTF-8 
        new_leo_file_encoding = UTF-8 

    These control the default encodings used when writing external
    files and .leo files. Changing the new_leo_file_encoding setting
    is not recommended. See the comments in leoSettings.leo. You may
    set default_derived_file_encoding to anything that makes sense for
    you.

4. The @encoding directive specifies the encoding used in a external file. You can't mix encodings in a single external file.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.357">.. _`Writing plugins`:   writingPlugins.html

Here are the XML elements that may appear in Leo files:

&lt;?xml&gt;
    Leo files start with the following line::

        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;?xml-stylesheet&gt;
    An xml-stylesheet line is option.  For example::

        &lt;?xml-stylesheet ekr_stylesheet?&gt;

&lt;leo_file&gt;
    The &lt;leo_file&gt; element opens an element that contains the entire file.
    &lt;/leo_file&gt; ends the file.

&lt;leo_header&gt; 
    The &lt;leo_header&gt; element specifies version information and other information
    that affects how Leo parses the file.  For example::

        &lt;leo_header file_format="2" tnodes="0" max_tnode_index="5725" clone_windows="0"/&gt;

    The file_format attribute gives the 'major' format number.
    It is '2' for all 4.x versions of Leo.
    The tnodes and clone_windows attributes are no longer used.
    The max_tnode_index	attribute is the largest tnode index.

&lt;globals&gt;
    The globals element specifies information relating to the entire file.
    For example::

        &lt;globals body_outline_ratio="0.50"&gt;
            &lt;global_window_position top="27" left="27" height="472" width="571"/&gt;
            &lt;global_log_window_position top="183" left="446" height="397" width="534"/&gt;
        &lt;/globals&gt;

    -   The body_outline_ratio attribute specifies the ratio of the height of the body pane to
        the total height of the Leo window.
        It initializes the position of the splitter separating the outline pane from the body pane.

    -   The global_window_position and global_log_window_position elements
        specify the position of the Leo window and Log window in global coordinates:

&lt;preferences&gt;
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the &lt;preferences&gt; element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty &lt;preferences&gt; element.

&lt;find_panel_settings&gt;
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the &lt;find_panel_settings&gt; element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty &lt;find_panel_settings&gt; element.

&lt;clone_windows&gt;
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the &lt;clone_windows&gt; element when reading.
    Leo no longer writes &lt;clone_windows&gt; elements.

&lt;vnodes&gt;
    A single &lt;vnodes&gt; element contains nested &lt;v&gt; elements.
    &lt;v&gt; elements correspond to vnodes.
    The nesting of &lt;v&gt; elements indicates outline structure in the obvious way.

&lt;v&gt;
    The &lt;v&gt; element represents a single vnode and has the following form::

        &lt;v...&gt;&lt;vh&gt;sss&lt;/vh&gt; (zero or more nested v elements) &lt;/v&gt;

    The &lt;vh&gt; element specifies the headline text.
    sss is the headline text encoded with the usual XML escapes.
    As shown above, a &lt;v&gt; element may contain nested &lt;v&gt; elements.
    This nesting indicates outline structure in the obvious way.
    Zero or more of the following attributes may appear in &lt;v&gt; elements::

        t=name.timestamp.n
        a="xxx"

    The t="Tnnn" attribute specifies the &lt;t&gt; element associated with a &lt;v&gt; element.
    The a="xxx" attribute specifies vnode attributes.
    The xxx denotes one or more upper-case letters whose meanings are as follows::

        C	The vnode is a clone. (Not used in 4.x)
        E	The vnode is expanded so its children are visible.
        M	The vnode is marked.
        T	The vnode is the top visible node.
        V	The vnode is the current vnode.

    For example, a="EM"  specifies that the vnode is expanded and is marked.

    **New in 4.0**:

    -   &lt;v&gt; elements corresponding to @file nodes now contain tnodeList attributes.
        The tnodeList attribute allows Leo to recreate the order in which nodes should 
        appear in the outline.
        The tnodeList attribute is a list of gnx's: global node indices.
        See Format of external files (4.x) for the format of gnx's.

    -   Plugins and scripts may add attributes to &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements.
        See `Writing plugins`_ for details.

&lt;tnodes&gt;
    A single &lt;tnodes&gt; element contains a non-nested list of &lt;t&gt; elements.

&lt;t&gt;
    The &lt;t&gt; element represents the body text of the corresponding &lt;v&gt; element.
    It has this form::

        &lt;t tx="&lt;gnx&gt;"&gt;sss&lt;/t&gt;

    The tx attribute is required.
    The t attribute of &lt;v&gt; elements refer to this tx attribute.
    sss is the body text encoded with the usual XML escapes.

    **New in 4.0**: Plugins and scripts may add attributes to &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt;
    elements. See `Writing plugins`_ for details.

<t tx="TL.20080804095315.9">If you use the open-with command to open a node text in Vim and your Vim's "tag" file refers to external files then there is a risk that a external file that is initially displayed via the "tag" command" in Vim is accidentally edited and saved from the external Vim editor while your Leo session still contains the external file's original text that may later recreate the original external file during a Leo save operation (overwriting the changes saved from the Vim editor).

To prevent this problem, modifications to external files can be avoided by using Vim's "modeline" feature to disable editing of external files.

Vim's "modeline" feature scans each loaded buffer for text at the top or bottom of the file containing " vim:" followed by a series of Vim options. The text is usually embedded within a comment. The following example prevents modifications to a buffer in a Python file::

    # vim:noma (A space is required between the '#' and "vim:noma")

If this line is placed in a separate Leo node at the top or bottom of the list of nodes under a external file node (ex: @file) then any external file saved and then later loaded into Vim will, by default, not be modifiable. If a derived file does need to be edited then modifications can be re-enabled on a file-by-file basis by issuing Vim's ":ma" command while viewing the derived file.

The number of lines that Vim checks at the top and bottom of the buffer is configurable. The following Vim command must be placed in the vimrc file to allow for Leo's trailing sentinel lines::

    set modelines=8

Issue the ":help modeline" command within Vim for the more information about modelines.

#############################
Writing Leo scripts in Python
#############################

..  "Leo a way to make a "living" document. A document built out of
..  discrete parts that can be re-organized on the fly to meet the needs of
..  a varying audience... just the possibility of keeping system
..  maintenance scripts in the IT manual is mind boggling."---David Nichols

This chapter tells how to write **Leo scripts**, Python scripts run from any Leo node. This chapter is intended for those fairly comfortable with Python scripting. If you are not, please study the excellent `Python Tutorial &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/&gt;`_. Jacob Peck has written a more `informal scripting tutorial &lt;http://blog.suspended-chord.info/2014/01/28/intro-to-leo-scripting/&gt;`_.

.. ``Ctrl-B (execute-script)`` executes the body text of the presently selected node. Guided by Leo's markup, execute-script **composes** the script from the node and possibly some or all of its descendants.

Three predefined symbols, **c**, **g** and **p** give Leo scripts easy access to all the data in the outline. These symbols also allow Leo scripts to execute any code in Leo's own code base.

**Positions** and **vnodes** are the foundation of Leo scripting. leo/core/leoNodes.py defines the corresponding Position and VNode classes. These classes provide access to all outline data, and allow Leo scripts to create and change outlines.

.. _`Leo's cheat sheet`: cheatsheet.html
.. _`scripting portion`: cheatsheet.html#scripting

**Further study**: The `scripting portion`_ of `Leo's cheat sheet`_ contains more information about scripting.

    c.doCommand(c.markHeadline,label="markheadline")

You can also call command handlers directly so that hooks will not be called::

    c.markHeadline()

You can invoke minibuffer commands by name.  For example::

    c.executeMinibufferCommand('open-outline')

c.keyHandler.funcReturn contains the value returned from the command. In many cases, as above, this value is simply 'break'.

Scripts can get the following ivars of the Commands class::

    ivars = (

    )
    print("Prefs ivars...\n",color="purple")
    for ivar in ivars:
        print(getattr(c,ivar))

If your script sets c.tab_width it should call f.setTabWidth to redraw the screen::

    c.tab_width = -4    # Change this and see what happens.

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows. Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of that file using Leo's Execute Script command. By default, Leo sends all output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable this output by calling app.log.disable or app.log.enable

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body and Edit Headline commands. Those commands require interaction with the user. For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the headlines in that file::

    path = g.os_path_finalize_join(g.app.loadDir,'..','test','test.leo')
    assert g.os_path_exists(path),path

    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    c2 = g.openWithFileName(path)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

    for p in c2.all_positions():
        g.es(g.toEncodedString(p.h,"utf-8"))

From the movie, My Cousin Vinny::

    Mona Lisa Vito: So what's your problem?
    Vinny Gambini: My problem is, I wanted to win my first case
    without any help from anybody.
    Mona Lisa: Well, I guess that plan's moot.
    Vinny : Yeah.
    Mona Lisa: You know, this could be a sign of things to come.
    You win all your cases, but with somebody else's help, right?
    You win case after case, and then afterwards you have to go up
    to somebody and you have to say, "thank you."

    Oh my God, what a fucking nightmare! 

Leo owes much of its visual design to MORE, possibly the most elegant computer program ever written. Leo's clone nodes are inspired by MORE.

The following deserve special thanks:

<t tx="ekr.20050306090601">.. index:: uA

Leo's .leo file format is extensible. The basis for extending .leo files are the v.unknownAttributes ivars of vnodes, also know as **user attributes**, uA's for short. Leo translates between uA's and xml attributes in the corresponding &lt;v&gt; elements in .leo files. Plugins may also use v.tempAttributes ivars to hold temporary information that will *not* be written to the .leo file. These two ivars are called **attribute ivars**.

Attribute ivars must be Python dictionaries, whose keys are names of plugins and whose values are *other* dictionaries, called **inner dictionaries**, for exclusive use of each plugin.

The v.u Python property allows plugins to get and set v.unknownAttributes easily::

    d = v.u # gets uA (the outer dict) for v
    v.u = d # sets uA (the outer dict) for v

For example::

    plugin_name = 'xyzzy'
    d = v.u # Get the outer dict.
    inner_d = d.get(plugin_name,{}) # Get the inner dict.
    inner_d ['duration']= 5
    inner_d ['notes'] "This is a note."
    d [plugin_name] = inner_d
    v.u = d

No corresponding Python properties exist for v.tempAttributes, so the corresponding example would be::

    plugin_name = 'xyzzy'
    # Get the outer dict.
    if hasattr(p.v,'tempAttributes'): d = p.v.tempAttributes
    else: d = {}
    inner_d = d.get(plugin_name,{}) # Get the inner dict.
    inner_d ['duration'] = 5
    inner_d ['notes'] = "This is a note."
    d [plugin_name] = inner_d
    p.v.tempAttributes = d

**Important**: All members of inner dictionaries should be picklable: Leo uses Python's Pickle module to encode all values in these dictionaries. Leo will discard any attributes that can not be pickled. This should not be a major problem to plugins. For example, instead of putting a tnode into these dictionaries, a plugin could put the tnode's gnx (a string) in the dictionary.

**Note**: Leo does *not* pickle members of inner dictionaries whose name (key) starts with str\_. The values of such members should be a Python string. This convention allows strings to appear in .leo files in a more readable format.

Here is how Leo associates uA's with &lt;v&gt; elements in .leo files:

- **Native xml attributes** are the attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements that are known (treated specially) by Leo's read/write code. The native attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements are a, t, vtag, tnodeList, marks, expanded and descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes. All other attributes of &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements are **foreign xml attributes**.

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create v.unknownAttributes ivars for any vnode whose corresponding &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt; element contains a foreign xml attribute.

- When writing a file, Leo will write foreign xml attributes in &lt;v&gt; elements if the corresponding vnode contains an unknownAttributes ivar.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing the unknownAttributes ivars.

<t tx="ekr.20050417072710.1">Plugins and scripts should call u.beforeX and u.afterX methods to describe the operation that is being performed. **Note**: u is shorthand for c.undoer. Most u.beforeX methods return undoData that the client code merely passes to the corresponding u.afterX method. This data contains the 'before' snapshot. The u.afterX methods then create a bead containing both the 'before' and 'after' snapshots.

u.beforeChangeGroup and u.afterChangeGroup allow multiple calls to u.beforeX and u.afterX methods to be treated as a single undoable entry. See the code for the Replace All, Sort, Promote and Demote commands for examples. The u.beforeChangeGroup and u.afterChangeGroup methods substantially reduce the number of u.beforeX and afterX methods needed.

Plugins and scripts may define their own u.beforeX and afterX methods. Indeed, u.afterX merely needs to set the bunch.undoHelper and bunch.redoHelper ivars to the methods used to undo and redo the operation. See the code for the various u.beforeX and afterX methods for guidance.

p.setDirty and p.setAllAncestorAtFileNodesDirty now return a dirtyVnodeList that all vnodes that became dirty as the result of an operation. More than one list may be generated: client code is responsible for merging lists using the pattern dirtyVnodeList.extend(dirtyVnodeList2)

See the section &lt;&lt; How Leo implements unlimited undo &gt;&gt; in leoUndo.py for more details. In general, the best way to see how to implement undo is to see how Leo's core calls the u.beforeX and afterX methods.

.. _`rst3 tutorial`: tutorial-rst3.html

Please read the `rst3 tutorial`_ before reading this chapter.

This chapter covers advanced settings and features of the rst3 command. It is for power users only.

*Are you sure you want to read this chapter?* The tutorial covers everything most people need to know about the rst3 command. Leo's own documentation uses none of the features discussed here.

<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.10">The rst3 command defines a code-block rST directive. The primary purpose of this directive is to show formatted source code.

In rst mode you can insert the code-block directive like any other rST markup. The rst3 command generates code-block directives automatically in code mode. This directive takes one argument, a language name.  Like this::

    .. code-block:: Python

        import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
        import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

The output looks like this::

    import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

.. _`Scripting Tutorial`:   tutorial-scripting.html

See the `Scripting Tutorial`_ for many examples of how to use code-blocks.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.11">HTML files generated by the rst3 command assume that three .css (cascading style sheet) files exist in the same directory. For the HTML output to look good the following .css files should exist:

- default.css is the default style sheet that docutils expects to exist.

- leo_rst.css contains some style improvements based on Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory.

.. - silver_city.css is the style sheet that controls the syntax highlighting generated by SilverCity.

The latter two style sheets are imported at the end of the default.css.

**Important:** You can use cascading style sheets to do things that otherwise wouldn't be possible with "plain" rST. For instance, the background color of this page was specified in a body style.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.13">.. _ListManagerDocs.html: ListManagerDocs.html
.. _wxListManager.leo:    wxListManager.leo

The file `ListManagerDocs.html`_ is an impressive example of the kind of output that can be generated relatively easily using the rst3 command.

The source for ListManagerDocs.html is `wxListManager.leo`_. **Important**: wxListManager.leo was written for the old rst2 plugin; it could be greatly simplified if adapted for the rst3 command.

This documentation was created using the rst3 command. The source code for this documentation is in LeoDocs.leo. The source code for the rst3 command is in leoRst.py in leoPy.leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.14">Leo 5.1 substantially simplifies the code in leoRst.py. The only rules:

- All top-level commands must call rst.initSettings, which calls rst.preprocessTree.
- Code that writes body text must call rst.init_write.

``rst.d0``
    This dictionary contains the defaults for each option. Keys are the option name, *not* including the ``rst3_`` prefix. Settings in @settings trees update its entries.
    
``rst.dd``
    A dictionary of dictionaries. Keys are vnodes. Values are a dictionary of settings set in that *particular* vnode.

``rst.getOption(p,name)``
    Searches the ``rst.dd`` and ``rst.d0`` dicts, starting at ``p``, looking for an entry for ``name``. This greatly simplifies the code that creates ``rst.dd``. Surprisingly, this search makes the code about 50% faster.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.16">Josef Dalcolmo wrote the initial rst plugin. Timo Honkasalo, Bernhard Mulder, Paul Paterson, Kent Tenney and Steve Zatz made contributions to the rst and rst2 plugins.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.4">The section covers complex options arising from two equivalent problems:

- How to generate documentation from computer source code in a Leo outline.
- How to embed documentation in computer source code in a Leo outline.

*Please stop reading now if these problems don't interest you!*
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.5">The following options are for the use of Bernhard Mulder's http plugin. The http plugin creates an http server running on a local port, typically 8130. When the http plugin is running you will see a purple message in the log window that looks something like this::

    http serving enabled on port 8130...

To use the http plugin, start a web browser and enter this url::

    http://localhost:8130/

You will see a a top level page containing one link for every open .leo file. Clicking on a link will cause the http server to pass a new page to the browser. You can use the browser's refresh button to update the top-level view in the browser after you have opened or closed files.

**Important**: See the docstring for the http plugin for information on configuring the plugin. Some of the following rst3 settings must match values of settings for the http plugin.

Here are the rst3 options that support the http plugin:

.. glossary::

``http_server_support (default: False)``
    A master switch: none of the following options have any effect unless this option is True. If True, the rst3 command does the following:

- Writes **node markers** in the rst output for use by the http plugin. Node markers are rst named hyperlink targets. By default they look like: ``.. _http-node-marker-N``, where N is a unique node number.

- Adds additional information to all nodes of the tree being formatted using Leo's unknownAttributes mechanism.

``http_attributename (default: rst_http_attribute)``
    The name of the attribute name written to the ``unknownAttributes`` attribute of each outline node in the rst root tree. The default is ``rst_http_attribute``. It should match this setting: ``@string rst_http_attributename = rst_http_attribute``.

``clear_http_attributes (default: False)``
    **True**: the rst3 command initially clears the fields specified by `http_attributename`.  

``node_begin_marker (default: http-node-marker-)``
    The string used for node markers.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.7">Any headline that starts with @rst- controls the rst3 command.

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

..  @rst-code &lt;section&gt; 
..      Enter code mode. (Code mode is covered in the advanced topics sections)
..      Create a section if the show_headlines option is True.

``@rst-ignore &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Ignore the node, but *not* its descendants.

``@rst-ignore-node &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Same as `@rst-ignore`.

``@rst-ignore-tree &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Ignore the node and its descendants.

``@rst-no-head &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Ignore the headline but not the body text of this node. *This option has no effect on descendant nodes*.

``@rst-no-headlines &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Ignore the headline of this node and descendant nodes.
    
``@rst-table &lt;ignored text&gt;``
    Ignore headlines and write exactly one newline at the end of this node and all descendant nodes. Very useful for creating rST tables.

``@rst-option &lt;option&gt; = &lt;value&gt;``
    Set a single option to the given value. The default value is True.

``@rst-options &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Set options from body text. The body text should contain nothing but
    lines of the form ``&lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;``

``@rst-preformat &lt;ignored-text&gt;``
    Format the body text of the node as computer source code. In effect, this option adds a line containing '::' at the start of the body text. The option then indents all following lines. *This option has no effect on descendant nodes*.

..  @rst-rst
..      Enter rst mode. (Rst mode is the mode of operation discussed in the tutorial.)
..      Create a section if the show_headlines option is True.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.8">**Option doc parts** set rst3 options. Option doc parts start with ``@ @rst-options`` followed by lines of the form ``name=value``. Comment lines starting with ``..`` are allowed. For example::

    @ @rst-options
    .. This comment line is ignored.
    show_headlines=False
    show_leo_directives=False
    verbose=True
    @c

This is a real Leo doc part. Like all other doc parts an option doc part starts with ``@`` and continues until the end of body text or until the next ``@c``.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.9">Settings in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo specify the defaults to be used for all rst3 options.  The form of these settings is::

    @bool rst3_&lt;option name&gt; = True/False
    @string rst3_&lt;option name&gt; = aString

That is, to create a default value for an rst3 setting, you must prefix the option name with ``rst3_``.  For example::

    @bool rst3_write_intermediate_file = True

The main concept that impress me is that the source listing isn't the main focus any more. You focus on the non-linear, hierarchical, collapsible outline of the source code."---Korakot Chaovavanich

"Leo is a quantum leap for me in terms of how many projects I can manage and how much information I can find and organize and store in a useful way."---Dan Winkler

"Wow, wow, and wow...I finally understand how to use clones and I realized that this is exactly how I want to organize my information. Multiple views on my data, fully interlinkable just like my thoughts."---Anon

"Edward... you've come up with perhaps the most powerful new concept in code manipulation since VI and Emacs.---David McNab

"Leo is...a revolutionary step in the right direction for programming."---Brian Takita

"Leo is amazingly stable. Docs are often weak with Open Source Software. Not so Leo: Leo is unusually well documented."---F. Geiger

"Leo is unimaginably useful and I always find new things it already knows(!) how to do. Indeed I am amazed by the never-ending resources and patience Edward is putting into it and its users community. Excellent."---Gil Shwartz

I feel strongly that Ed Ream, our ever-patient, ever-productive Leo architect deserves a nomination [for the ActiveState OpenSource Award.] Among other reasons, for:

- Delivering the first usable visual literate programming tool.
- Adding a vast abundance of new features.
- Making possible a previously unimaginable amount of leverage in code editing.
- Eliminating vast amounts of menial programming labour.
- Tirelessly and patiently supporting users, and catering to a wide range of feature requests.---David McNab

August 28, 2002, on `slashdot`_.

Hello, my full name is David Speed Ream. I am known as Speed to friends and enemies alike, but I gladly answer to David or most any other handle. I am an unabashed and biased fan of Leo, the fact that it was written by my brother Edward only slightly coloring my already colored glasses. I have been testing and using Leo in software production for over 4 years. My company currently has over 50,000 lines of code in over 100 source files that are written using Leo.

My comments are from two points of view, the first being software project manager for a complicated, multi-module software product, and the second being as a production line coder. For me, Leo’s greatest and only real drawback is the learning curve. This learning curve can be shallow if all that is required is that someone code using Leo. However, in our company we allocate 40 to 80 hours *on top* of the normal coding load for someone to come up to speed on Leo. The ROI (return on investment) is calculated by me to be on the order of 3 months. So if I hire a consultant for less than 3 months, I don’t teach him Leo, even though all source code in our company must reside in Leo files for the reasons I won’t go into now.

I consider that my coders are 15 to 30 percent more efficient in their daily operations than my competition’s people. This indefensible claim of mine is based on the changes in my productivity as Leo grew from a test document production tool to the primary production method for all our assembly, c and cpp source code.

Personally, I hate to deal with documentation when I write code, except:

1) When I am first sitting down to solve a new problem. Then the documentation becomes quite long-winded and pontificatory, as if I were the only one on earth smart enough to solve the problem - or

2) When I come back to code I or someone else has written and find the documentation insufficient to understand the code without study (seems to be most of the time).

So I do not require my engineers or myself to do a great job of documentation, nor do I use Leo for that purpose. Rather, it is Leo’s outlining and organizing ability, and Leo’s ability to create source files from within the outline that give me what I think is a tremendous competitive advantage. Each of my company’s products run on all versions of windows from Win 3.1 to XP. In our flagship software piece, there are ten main modules, and each module is maintained by one single Leo file. In the CODEC module, one Leo file named compress.leo organizes and creates seven .asm files, forty-four .c files, twenty .h files, two .def files, four .mak files, etc. etc. etc. This one file can be checked out from source code control and given to an engineer for the addition of a new feature.

In it are contained all the known issues for the CODEC, each issue arranged in its own clone section. One clone section groups together every routine, variable or type definition that must change between different versions of Windows. These sections could be from six different c source files, two assembly files, and eight .h files. Another clone section groups together those sections relating to memory problems, which change according to the memory configuration and TSR configuration (or lack thereof) on the target machine. Another clone section groups sections that fail (or don’t fail) if the routine in question was accidentally run during the dreaded ‘interrupt time’. Another clone section is a section containing clones, each of which is named after the major bug that was fixed when the engineer who fixed the bug grouped a bunch of routines, definitions, etc. together to fix the bug.

None of the above clone sections was ‘designed’ into the document. Just the opposite happens. When the codec was first written, there was just a single Leo file with a bunch of sections for each c routine or assembly module. As the product grew and was tested on various platforms, each failure of the module was organized into clones each time a failure was fixed. This is what I call “SELF DOCUMENTING CODE”. This has nothing to do with me sitting and documenting anything. Its just that the STRUCTURE of a bug fix (or product enhancement) lives on long after the coding is done, as long as no one is foolish enough to delete the cloned sections that ‘DOCUMENT’ what happened.

In actual practice, this organizational ‘history’ is so powerful that I can’t begin to describe it. A ‘REVERSE LEARNING CURVE’ happens when an engineer gets a Leo file that already has the ‘interrupt time sensitive’ routines grouped together by the last unfortunate soul who had to work on them. There may not be any more written documentation, but the knowledge contained in the structure can be breathtaking. It is certainly time saving. I find this particularly true in my own case. Often I’ll look at some code that seems totally unfamiliar and think ‘what idiot wrote this crap’. Then I’ll look at the version control comments and realize that I wrote the crap. Then for sure I know the documentation is non-existent, but the clones I used to develop it are still there, and they always serve to refresh my memory in an indescribable way.

Enough of this commentary, I just looked at the clock. Best wishes to anyone willing to try Leo for a week. I hope you will be glad you did.

<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.13">The Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy.

#1 Reason would probably be clone nodes. One node can point to another. Another way of putting this is is that a leaf can be on more than one tree. For example, suppose you have a list of recipes. You simultaneously put a single recipe under multiple categories or even multiple hierarchies. You could put "3 bean enchilada" simultaneously under Recipes-Mexican and Food-Gas. Another example would be, if you are a biologist trying to decide under which genus to put a new species, you could put the species under two simultaneously. In effect, you can build a 3-D tree.


#2 Reason would probably be that Leo outlines can be embedded in external text files. So, a Leo outline is more than an outline, it is a meta-structure that can be added to another text without changing that text, but rather providing an external road map to the text. Microsoft Word has a text (xml) version with a commenting convention, so Leo can even be used to add outlines into Word docs, although it isn't set up to do that now. For example, see http://www.3dtree.com/ev/e/sbooks/leo/sbframetoc_ie.htm In this case, the upper window of Leo is the meta-structure, and the bottom window is the file to which the meta-structure is being applied, viewed one node at a time.

I may not have made #2 very clear, but it is actually a very useful feature. It takes some getting used to before one sees all of the possibilities tho. One way to think of it is that Leo allows you to throw external documents into your outline, and yet the external document remains independent and can still be edited separately.

Some other cool things about Leo which Word doesn't feature:
1. Pure xml output that is easy to transform into other formats (next version of Word will have true XML format, but not as easy to work with). One consequence of this is that Leo files can be transformed pretty easily to web pages with their outlining capability intact.
2. Easy to add features since is programmed in Python and open source. Maybe your average user can't start hacking on it, but a surprising amount can be tacked on...
3. Free, opensource, multi-platform
4. Leo is scriptable with Python. It should be possible to build a Tickler into Leo using Python scripting, for example.

<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.14">First of all, kudos to you for the excellent progress you've been making with Leo. I upgraded today after about three months of using and older version and I was thrilled to see all the great improvements that have happened so fast. I especially love the ability to go to next clone. I think you're really showing what open source can do and your current trajectory puts you on track to kick Emacs into the dustbin of computing history.

So today I copied all my data (personal information manager and project management stuff) out of my old outliner (ThoughtManager, which syncs with and runs on the Palm) and put it into Leo. It took me hours to do it and then to rearrange it the way I really wanted it. But having the ability to make clones and have different ways to view my data is, as you know, fabulous. In my case, for personal information and project management things, I used the flexibility of clones to allow me to see my data in several different views: 1) by project, the logical hierarchical breakdown by topic, 2) by person, so whenever I'm talking to someone I can easily see all the pending items related to them which may be spread over multiple projects, 3) by priority, so I can see what needs to get done sooner and what can wait for later and, 4) a special case of priority called "Today" for the things I'm going to focus on in the coming hours.

Now here's why I don't miss the ability of my old outliner to sync the entire outline with the Palm. It turns out the main thing I really want in the Palm is the top category "Today" so all I have to do is have Leo flatten that one heading into a text file (and it kindly remembers the name and directory of the file I used last time) and then I'm done because I've told the Palm Hotsync manager that that file should be sent to Palm memo pad every time I sync. The Palm Hotsync manager does a nice job of sending a text file to the Palm memo pad and even breaks the file up into multiple memo records if it's too big to fit in just one. So that gives me enough to be able to browse (or full text search) the small amount of data that I really want right inside my Palm (which is also my cell phone). Quick and dirty but it works.

For times when I want my whole outline with me, Leo wins again because thanks to its cross platform nature I can take my whole outline with me on my Mac iBook, even though I usually edit it on a Windows PC (which is the only kind of machine my old outliner would run on). Quite frankly, although my old outliner was able to shoehorn the whole thing into my palm/cellphone, it was a pain to access it on the small screen and slow processor. Now when I anticipate I'll need the whole thing, for example when I'm going to a meeting, I can put it on my Mac iBook (under X and Fink for now until Python can do it native under Aqua) and have real, full access to it all.

I think now in addition to being great for programming Leo is also a great PIM. Being able to flatten a strategically chosen portion of the outline into a known file name that the Palm sync manager has been told to send to the Palm on every sync does the trick for me. I wonder if you would consider something like an @flatten directive so I can have that done automatically for me every time I save my outline? For now it's up to me to flatten the node I want manually, although once I've done that the transfer to the Palm is automatic.

You're my hero! Thank you so much.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.15">Another day, another breakthrough using Leo--now I realize Leo is the best URL bookmark manager there is.  No more bookmarks menus or favorites lists inside the browser for me.  With the @url directive I can just double click on the URL to open it in my browser.  Leo lets me arrange the URLs in a hierarchy (or multiple hierarchies), attach notes to them, save clippings of things I read on the sites.  It's sooo much better than anything the browsers have built in and it lets me easily use different browsers on different platforms and different machines (try that with the browsers' built-in bookmark managers).

When using Leo as a project manager and personal information manager as I do I can heavily annotate every task and project with helpful and relevant URLs.  And since URLs can be of the file:// form, they're not just for web pages or HTML documents;  I can link to any file on my disk of any type to be opened by any program.

Leo is a quantum leap for me in terms of how many projects I can manage and how much information I can find and organize and store in a useful way.  I'm a data-mining army of one now and the web is my playground. Every time I find a web page that has interesting links to others, those links get stored in my Leo outline too, right where I can find them and make practical use of them.  I can easily accept dozens of valuable links every day and integrate them into what I'm doing in a way that I'm confidant they won't get lost or forgotten.  Before I always used to get bogged down by the difficulty of managing bookmarks inside the browser.  But now I'm no longer the victim of information overload buried in the knowledge landslide of the Internet;  instead I'm the professional strip miner with the world's biggest bulldozer.  I eagerly plunge into mountains of data and emerge with all the valuable information nuggets neatly stored and organized.  And my storehouse of knowledge is a flexible thing where I can reorganize and prioritize and massage the data to my heart's content as I learn more about it and decide to use it in different ways for different purposes.  It's the difference between the pick axe and the steam shovel for me.

<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.16">This year my accountant is getting a beautiful printout generated by LaTeX and Leo. I have a complicated tax situation this year, but I got it all laid out and organized in Leo. Then I had each of the nodes that had something my accountant needs to see write the data out to a file in the form a LaTeX table.

Sometimes a row of a table would have a result that was calculated by adding up a list of numbers. For that I used the modern day equivalent of an adding machine paper tape--I stored a lisp s-expression in a Leo comment. I like s-expressions for this because once I put the opening "(+" on one line and the closing ")" on another line, I can fill in additional numbers just by typing them and can even annotate them with comments. So in the middle of generating a LaTeX file I might have something like this::

    @
    (+
    1165.26 1823.70 ; May 2002
    123.38 ; June 2002
    13.50 ; July 2002
    13.21 ; October 2002
    55.25 ; November 2002
    )
    @c

That's an annotated record of how I arrived at the number the accountant will actually see. I can just paste it into any lisp or scheme interpreter and get the total. Adding additional numbers is easy.

For next year, I think I might take this a step further. What I did this year is good for adding up numbers to get a total for one row of a LaTeX table. But it turns out I'd also like some more processing done on those tables (which I had to do by hand this time--I'd like the rows sorted in reverse order by magnitude (so that the big numbers jump out at you from the start of the tables) and I'd like a total of all the rows in the table. So I think next year, instead of having an s-expression that computes the total of one row for me, I think I'll use s-expressions that generate whole tables, formatted for LaTex, from the underlying data. So I'm thinking next year my s-expressions might look more like this::

    @
    (table "Widget Related Expenses"
        ("widget insurance" (+
                        1165.26 1823.70 ; May 2002

                        13.21 ; October 2002
                        55.25 ; November 2002

         ("widget shipping" (+

                       ))
    )
    @c

The job of that "table" function would be to return the LaTeX code needed to display a table with the category names and values, sorted descending by magnitude, with the total displayed. It's sort of a poor man's way of doing a spreadsheet inside Leo and then making it look great using LaTeX. The idea would be as I wanted to add more data, I'd add it to the s-expression and then reevaluate the whole thing by pasting it into a lisp interpreter and then copying the result back into the same Leo node for LaTeX to process.---Dan

For some recent performance data collection work, under one outline are the theory behind the project, the code (generation) for the project, the project web page (generated from an @rst node tree),  and project deployment (little more than clicking a button). One can change focus from one aspect to another very quickly and use clones to really drill down into an area (for me it's typically the code) when needed.

That was my cue to write a long message explaining that there is indeed such a bulldozer and it's called Leo. (You can see my message there as a reply to her original posting.) I gave her my recipe for how to get someone else's messy, scary code into Leo and how to break it down into manageable chunks."---Dan Winkler

"Ed, you continue to push the envelope. The amazing thing is that the footprint isn't doubling every few months like it would be in another designer's hands. Adding features by removing constraints, hot refactoring while adding unit tests. Forget the book. I would pay to see the movie."

5. Open regedit "start...run...regedit"
6. Open HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and find the ".leo" extension type
7. Go New ... Key from the context menu 
8. Call the new key ShellNew 
9. Select the new key, right-click, choose New...String Value from the context menu
10. Call it FileName 
11. Double-click on the string, and modify it to be the filename of the leofile.leo file you created, including the extension
12. Exit the registry editor and restart Windows Explorer (you may need to reboot on Windows 98)

Now you should have a New:Leo File option in Explorer. This creates a duplicate of the file you saved. This can be useful because you could make a template Leo file containing some standard nodes_ that you always have and then save this.

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.115" str_atime="1376412852.0">For the most part, docutils_ does a good job of reporting errors. docutils_ prints a message to the console and inserts an unmistakable error message in the generated .html file. **Important**: On Windows it is helpful to `run Leo in a console`_.

However, in some cases, docutils_ crashes instead of properly reporting the problem. There are several workarounds:

1.  The crashes I have seen arise from the following bug in docutils. **Hyperlinks in image:: markup must be lower case**.  This will work::

        .. .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: faq_

    This will **crash**::

        .. .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: FAQ_

    So avoid this crash by making sure to use lower case targets in ':target:' markup.

2.  You can change the docutils_ source slightly so that it prints a traceback when it crashes. (The rst3 plugin should be able to do this, but I haven't figured out how yet.) It's easy enough to do this:

- Find the file core.py in top-level docutils folder. Typically this folder will be in Python's site-packages folder.

- Open core.py in some editor other than Leo.

- Find the method called report_Exceptions.

- Insert the following lines at the very start of this method::

        print 'EKR: added traceback'
        import traceback ; traceback.print_exc()

This will cause a traceback whenever docutils_ crashes. I have found that such tracebacks are generally enough to locate the general area of the problem. **Note**: These tracebacks go to the console window, so you should `run Leo in a console`_.

3.  As a last resort, you can isolate syntax errors by reducing your input files until they work again, then adding sections until you get a crash. This is easy enough to do (when using the rst3 plugin) by change a headline 'x' to @rst-ignore-tree x.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.116">.. From: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3240374

Using Leo's File-Export-Flatten Outline commands creates a MORE style outline which places all Leo body sections on the left margin. The headlines_ are indented with tabs which Excel will read as a tab delimited format. Once inside Excel there are benefits.

1. The most obvious benefit inside Excel is that the body sections (Excel first column) can be selected easily and highlighted with a different font color. This makes the MORE format very readable. Save a copy of your sheet as HTML and now you have a web page with the body sections highlighted.

2. It is possible to hide columns in Excel. Hiding the first column leaves just the headlines showing.

3. Formulas based on searching for a string can do calculations in Excel. For example if a heading "Current Assets" appears on level 4 then the body formula::

        =INDEX(A:A,MATCH("Current Assets",D:D,0)+1)

will retrieve it. The +1 after match looks down one row below the matched headline. The trick is to place all your headlines in quotes because Excel will see + "Current Assets" from the MORE outline. When Excel tries without the quotes it thinks it is a range name and displays a #N/A error instead of the headline. Also you must place a child node_ below to get the + sign instead of a - sign which would give a MORE headline of -"Current assets" , also is an error.

I think there is some interesting possibility here because of the enforcement of Leo body text being always in the first column. The Leo outline provides additional reference to organizing the problem not typical of spreadsheet models. Beyond scripting in Python, Excel is good at doing interrelated calculations and detecting problems like circular references. In Excel Tools-Options-General is a setting for r1c1 format which then shows numbers instead of letters for column references. Using this would allow entries like this in the leo body::

    1000
    3500
    =R[-1]C+R[-2]C

In Excel you would see 4500 below those two numbers. This is completely independent of where the block of three cells exists on the sheet.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.119">By Rich Ries. I often rework C code that's already been "Leo-ized"--the first pass was quick and dirty to get it going. When I do subsequent passes, I wind up with subnodes that are out of order with the sequence found in the main node_. It's not a big deal, but I like 'em ordered. With just one editor pane, clicking on the node_ to move would switch focus to that node_. I'd then need to re-focus on the main node_. A minor nuisance, but it does slow you down.

My solution is to open a second editor with its focus on the main node_. Switch to the other editor, and, referring to the first editor pane, move the nodes as you like. The second editor's pane will change focus to the node_ you're moving, but the first editor will stay focused on the main node_. It's a lot easier to do than to describe!

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.12">.. _`reference .leo files`: FAQ.html#what-is-a-reference-leo-file

Use @clean or @auto unless everyone in your work group uses Leo.  In that case, using @file is best.  Use local copies of `reference .leo files`_ instead of the reference files themselves.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.120">One way is to link directly to the media file from a Leo node_ (with @url) and write a script button to wrap all URL-nodes under the current node_ in a single HTML page. Then, you can view your media in two ways:

- Individually. You can directly click on the @url link to display the media in the browser (assuming you have your MIME/filetype associations set up correctly for your browser).

- In a group. You can click on a script button (you have to code this yourself, very simple) which should collect all @url nodes_ under the current node_ and dynamically generate a HTML page displaying either links to or embedded versions of the media (using the HTML trick described above to invoke the browser). This way, you can create collections of @url nodes under a single node_ (like a bookmark folder), and press a single button to view the @url collection as a single entity in the browser (with all browser capabilities like displaying the media).

You could probably generalize this idea of "collect all @url nodes under current node_ and display as HTML in browser" into a general-purpose plugin. However, the plugin would have to be somewhat smart in mapping a link to its corresponding HTML code (e.g. an image link gets mapped to an &lt;img&gt; HTML tag, a link to a Flash file gets mapped to an &lt;embed&gt; tag, etc).

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.14">.. _`Mulder/Ream update algorithm`: appendices.html#the-mulder-ream-update-algorithm

Use @clean trees. Files derived from @clean trees contain no sentinels_. However, Leo can update @clean trees from changes made to the corresponding external file.  The `Mulder/Ream update algorithm`_ makes this magic happen.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.16">Use @asis trees. Files derived from @asis trees contain no sentinels. Leo creates the external file simply by writing all body text in outline order. Leo can't update the outline unless the external file contains sentinels, so Leo does not update @asis trees automatically when you change the external file in an external editor.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.17">The import commands insert @ignore directives_ in the top-level node_. Leo does this so that you won't accidentally overwrite your files after importing them. Change the filename following @file (or @file) as desired, then remove the @ignore directive_. Saving the outline will then create the external file.

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.18">**Question**: I'm writing a Windows Script Component, which is an XML file with a CData section containing javascript. I can get the XML as I want it by using @language html, but how can I get the tangling comments inside the CData section to be java-style comments rather than html ones?

**Answer**: In @file trees you use the @delims directive to change comment delimiters. For example::

    @delims /* */ 
    Javascript stuff 
    @delims &lt;-- --&gt; 
    HTML stuff

**Important**: Leo can not revert to previous delimiters automatically; you must change back to previous delimiters using another @delims directive_.

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.2">First, read `Leo's tutorials`_. This will be enough to get you started if you just want to use Leo as an outliner_. If you intend to use Leo for programming, read the `scripting tutorial`_, then look at Leo's source code in the file LeoPy.leo. Spend 5 or 10 minutes browsing through the outline. Don't worry about details; just look for the following common usage patterns:

- The (Projects) tree shows how to use clones to represent tasks.

- Study @file leoNodes.py. It shows how to define more than one class in single file.

- Most other files show how to use a single @others directive to define one class.

- Most methods are defined using @others, *not* section definition nodes.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.20">Here is a posting which might be helpful: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2300457 The @first directive_ is the key to output usable code in unsupported languages. For example, to use Leo with the Basic language, use the following::

    @first $IFDEF LEOHEADER
    @delims '
    @c
    $ENDIF

So this would enable a basic compiler to "jump" over the "true" Leo-header-lines. Like this::

    $IFDEF LEOHEADER &lt;-conditional compilation directive 
    #@+leo-ver=4 &lt;-these lines not compiled
    #@+node:@file QParser005.INC
    #@@first
    #@delims ' 
    '@@c
    $ENDIF &lt;-... Until here!
    &lt;rest of derived code file ... &gt;

This changes the comment symbol the apostrophe, making comments parseable by a BASIC (or other language.)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.21">Use the @first directive_ in @file or @clean trees. The @first directive puts lines at the very start of files derived from @file. For example, the body text of @file spam.py might be::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python

The body text of @file foo.pl might be::

    @first #/usr/bin/perl

\@first directives must be the *very first* lines of @file nodes. More than one @first directive may exist, like this::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python
    @first # more comments.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.24">No. Everything in an @file trees must be part of the external file: orphan and @ignore nodes are invalid in @file trees. This restriction should not be troublesome. For example, you can organize your outline like this::

    + myClass
    ..+ ignored stuff
    ..+ @file myClass

(As usual, + denotes a headline.) So you simply create a new node_, called myClass, that holds your @file trees and stuff you don't want in the @file trees.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.25">By Rich Ries. Some older C compilers don't understand the "//" comment symbol, so using @language C won't work. Moreover, the following does not always work either::

    @comment /* */

This generates the following sentinel line::

    /*@@comment /* */*/

in the output file, and not all C compilers allow nested comments, so the last \*\/ generates an error. The solution is to use::

    #if 0
    @comment /* */
    #endif

Leo is happy: it recognizes the @comment directive_. The C compiler is happy: the C preprocessor strips out the offending line before the C compiler gets it.

Sections_ are convenient in the following circumstances:

- When you want to refer to snippets of code the can not be turned into methods. For example, many plugins start with the code like this::

    &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; version history &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; globals &gt;&gt;

    None of these sections could be replaced by methods.

- When you want to refer to a snippet of code that shares local variables with the enclosing code. This is surprisingly easy and safe to do, *provided* the section is used only in one place. `Section names`_ in such contexts can be clearer than method names.  For example::

    &lt;&lt; init ivars for writing &gt;&gt;

In short, I create sections when convenient, and convert them to functions or methods if they need to be used in several places.

    import leo.core.leoImport as leoImport

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.77">Just `run Leo in a console`_. At the point you want to drop into the debugger, execute this line::

    g.pdb()

All output from pdb goes to stdout, which is the console window. It would be good to create a subclass of pdb.Pdb that uses Leo's log pane rather than a console window, but I haven't done that. It could be done easily enough in a plugin...

**Important**: I recommend using g.trace instead of pdb.  For example::

    g.trace(x)

prints the name of the function or method containing the trace, and the value of
x. g.callers is often useful in combination with g.trace. g.callers(5)
returns the last 5 entries of the call stack. For example::

    g.trace(x,g.callers(5))

Used this way, g.trace shows you patterns that will be invisible using pdb.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.9">Internally, Leo represents all strings as unicode. Leo translates from a particular encoding to Unicode_ when reading .leo files or external files. Leo translates from Unicode_ to a particular encoding when writing external files. You may see strange looking characters if your text editor is expecting a different encoding. The encoding used in any external file is shown in the #@+leo sentinel line like this::

    #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

**Exception**: the encoding is UTF-8 if no -encoding= field exists. You can also use the @encoding directive_ to set the encoding for individual external files. If no @encoding directive_ is in effect, Leo uses the following settings_ to translate to and from unicode:

default_derived_file_encoding
    The encoding used for external files if no @encoding directive_ is in effect.
    This setting also controls the encoding of files that Leo writes.
    The default is UTF-8 (case not important).

new_leo_file_encoding
    The encoding specified in the following line of new .leo files::

        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"&gt;

    The default is UTF-8 (upper case for compatibility for old versions of Leo).

<t tx="ekr.20050830120857">The trick is to create a workflow that separates editing from testing. Putting test code in LeoPy.leo would waste a lot of time. To run tests you would have to exit Leo and reload LeoPy.leo. A much quicker way is to put all test code in a test.leo file. So to change and test code, do the following:

1. Save LeoPy.leo but do **not** exit Leo.

2. Quit the copy of Leo running test.leo, then reload test.leo.

3. Run test scripts from test.leo.

That's all. Python will recompile any changed .py files in the new copy of Leo. **Note**: I create a batch file called t.bat that runs test.leo, so to the "edit-reload-test" cycle is just:

1. Control-S (in LeoPy.leo: saves the .leo file)
2. t (in a console window: runs test.leo, compiling all changed .py files as a side effect)
3. Control-E (in test.leo: runs the test script)

The benefits of the new workflow:

- test.leo loads  _much_ more quickly than LeoPy.leo does. This new approach can increase the speed of the edit-reload-test cycle by more than a factor of 10. Hitting Control-S, t, Control-E takes about 5 seconds.

- LeoPy.leo runs with the *old* code, so it is much easier to fix syntax errors or exceptions in the *new* code: just fix the problem and save LeoPy.leo *without* closing LeoPy.leo, then restart test.leo. You run your tests on the new code, but you edit the new code with the old, stable code.

- test.leo is the perfect place to develop test. I can create and organize those tests and when I am done, ''test.leo'' is a log of my work.

<t tx="ekr.20050901084134">I wrote this soon after discovering Python in 2001. The conclusions are still valid today.
    
I've known for a while that Python was interesting; I attended a Python conference last year and added Python support to Leo. But last week I got that Python is something truly remarkable. I wanted to convert Leo from wxWindows to wxPython, so I began work on c2py, a Python script that would help convert from C++ syntax to Python. While doing so, I had an Aha experience. Python is more than an incremental improvement over Smalltalk or C++ or objective-C; it is "something completely different". The rest of this post tries to explain this difference.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.2">What struck me first as I converted C++ code to Python is how much less blah, blah, blah there is in Python. No braces, no stupid semicolons and most importantly, *no declarations*. No more pointless distinctions between const, char \*, char const \*, char \* and wxString. No more wondering whether a variable should be signed, unsigned, short or long.

Declarations add clutter, declarations are never obviously right and declarations don't prevent memory allocation tragedies. Declarations also hinder prototyping. In C++, if I change the type of something I must change all related declarations; this can be a huge and dangerous task. With Python, I can change the type of an object without changing the code at all! It's no accident that Leo's new log pane was created first in Python.

Functions returning tuples are a "minor" feature with a huge impact on code clarity. No more passing pointers to data, no more defining (and allocating and deallocating) temporary structs to hold multiple values.

.. _`pylint`: http://www.logilab.org/857

Python can't check declarations because there aren't any. However, there is a really nifty tool called `pylint`_ that does many of the checks typically done by compilers.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.3">Python is much more powerful than C++, not because Python has more features, but because Python needs *less* features. Some examples:

- Python does everything that the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) does, without any of the blah, blah, blah needed by STL. No fuss, no muss, no code bloat.

- Python's slicing mechanism is very powerful and applies to any sequence (string, list or tuple). Python's string library does more with far less functions because slices replace many functions typically found in other string libraries.

- Writing dict = {} creates a dictionary (hash table). Hash tables can contain anything, including lists and other hash tables.

- Python's special functions,  __init__, __del__, __repr__, __cmp__, etc. are an elegant way to handle any special need that might arise.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.4">Before using Python I never fully realized how difficult and dangerous memory allocation is in C++. Try doing::

        aList[i:j] = list(aString)

in C.  You will write about 20 lines of C code. Any error in this code will create a memory allocation crash or leak.

Python is fundamentally safe. C++ is fundamentally unsafe. When I am using Python I am free from worry and anxiety. When I am using C++ I must be constantly "on guard." A momentary lapse can create a hard-to-find pointer bug. With Python, almost nothing serious can ever go wrong, so I can work late at night, or after a beer. The Python debugger is always available. If an exception occurs, the debugger/interpreter tells me just what went wrong. I don't have to plan a debugging strategy! Finally, Python recovers from exceptions, so Leo can keep right on going even after a crash!
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.5">Python has almost all the speed of C. Other interpretive environments such as icon and Smalltalk have clarity, power and safety similar to Python. What makes Python unique is its seamless way of making C code look like Python code. Python executes at essentially the speed of C code because most Python modules are written in C. The overhead in calling such modules is negligible. Moreover, if code is too slow, one can always create a C module to do the job.

In fact, Python encourages optimization by moving to higher levels of expression. For example, Leo's Open command reads an XML file. If this command is too slow I can use Python's XML parser module. This will speed up Leo while at the same time raising the level of the code.

<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.6">Little of Python is completely new. What stands out is the superb engineering judgment evident in Python's design. Python is extremely powerful, yet small, simple and elegant. Python allows me to express my intentions clearly and at the highest possible level.

The only hope of making Leo all it can be is to use the best possible tools. I believe Python will allow me to add, at long last, the new features that Leo should have.

Edward K. Ream, October 25, 2001.  P.S., September, 2005:

Four years of experience have only added to my admiration for Python. Leo could
not possibly be what it is today without Python.

<t tx="ekr.20050902105852">Leo grew out of my efforts to use Donald Knuth's "CWEB system of Structured documentation." I had known of literate programming since the mid 1980's, but I never understood how to make it work for me. In November 1995 I started thinking about programming in earnest. Over the holidays I mused about making programs more understandable. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.1">In January 1996 the fog of confusion suddenly cleared. I summarized my thinking with the phrase, **web are outlines in disguise**. I suspected that outline views were the key to programming, but many details remained obscure.

March 5, 1996, is the most important date in Leo's history. While returning from a day of skiing, I discussed my thoughts with Rebecca. During that conversation I realized that I could use the MORE outliner as a prototype for a "programming outliner." I immediately started work on my first outlined program. It quickly became apparent that outlines work: all my old problems with programming vanished. The @others directive dates from this day. I realized that MORE's outlines could form the basis for Leo's screen design. Rather than opening body text within the outline, as MORE does, I decided to use a separate body pane.

I hacked a translator called M2C which allowed me to use MORE to write real code. I would write code in MORE, copy the text to the clipboard in MORE format, then run M2C, which would convert the outline into C code. This process was useful, if clumsy. I called the language used in the outline SWEB, for simplified CWEB. Much later Leo started supporting the noweb language.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.10">Leo 4.1 Final went out the door February 20, 2004. This release reorganized the code base to support gui's other than tkinter.

Leo first used gnx's (global node indices) as a foolproof way of associating nodes in .leo files with nodes in external files. At the time, there was still intense discussions about protecting the logical consistency of outlines. @thin was later to solve all those problems, but nobody knew that then.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.11">Leo 4.2 Final was released September 20, 2004.  This is one of the most significant dates in Leo's history. There were so many significant changes that it is hard to remember what Leo was like before it.

Leo 4.2 eliminated worries about consistency of outlines and external files: Leo recreates all essential information from @thin files, so *there is nothing left in the .leo file to get out of sync*. Thin external files use gnx's extensively. This simplifies the file format and makes thin external files more cvs friendly.
  
Leo 4.2 forms the **great divide** in Leo's internal data structures. Before 4.2, Leo every node in the outline had its own vnode. This was a big performance problem: clone operations had to traverse the entire outline! 4.2 represents clones by sharing subtrees. Kent Tenney and Bernhard Mulder made absolutely crucial contributions. Kent pointed out that it is a tnode, not a vnode that must form the root of the shared data. Bernhard showed that iterators avoid creating huge numbers of positions.

::

    The debut of @all, @test and @suite
    The mod_scripting plugin creates script buttons
    A much faster and more robust spell checker plugin
    Leo saves t.unknownAttributes in the root nodes of @thin trees
    New iterators</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.12">Leo 4.3 final was released May 23, 2005.  This release introduced settings files. These files replaced config.txt and made settings completely extensible and flexible. This release also introduced the ill-fated settings pane. It was soon retired because it inhibited development.

::

    Leo stores recent files in .leoRecentFiles.txt files
    Added PluginsManager plugin
    Support for extensions in the leo/extensions directory
    Leo predefines c, g and p in scripts and @test nodes
    
Leo 4.3.3 final went out the door September 17, 2005.  It added the rst3 plugin.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.2">Throughout 1996 I created a version of Leo on the Macintosh in plain C and the native Mac Toolbox. This was a poor choice; I wasted a huge amount of time programming with these primitive tools. However, this effort convinced me that Leo was a great way to program.

Late in 1997 I wrote a Print command to typeset an outline. Printing (Weaving) is supposedly a key feature of literate programming. Imagine my surprise when I realized that such a "beautiful" program listing was almost unintelligible; all the structure inherent in the outline was lost! I saw clearly that typesetting, no matter how well done, is no substitute for explicit structure.

In 1998 I created a version of Leo using Apple's YellowBox environment. Alas, Apple broke its promises to Apple developers. I had to start again.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.3">In May of 1999 I began work on the Borland version of Leo for Windows. Borland C++ was much better than CodeWarrior C, but it was still C++. Still, the Borland Delphi classes were a pleasure to use and free of bugs. I redesigned Leo's file format for the Windows version of Leo; the Yellow Box file format was a binary format that requires the Yellow Box runtime.

There are two significant problems with the Borland version of Leo. First, it works only on Windows. Second, it can never be Open software, because it uses Borland's Delphi classes and a commercial syntax coloring component.

This version of Leo was the first version to use xml as the format of .leo files. Marc-Antoine Parent urged me to use XML and patiently explained how to use XML properly. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.4">I attended the Python conference in early 2001. In May of 2000 I began work on an wxWindows version of Leo. This did not work out, but something good did come from this effort. I spent a lot of time adding Python scripting to the wxWindows code and I became familiar with Python and its internals.

I really started to 'get' Python in September 2001. I wrote the white papers at about this time. Python solved *all* my programming problems. I rewrote Leo in Python in about two months! For the first time in my career I was no longer anxious while programming; it simply isn't possible to create bad bugs in Python. The Python version of Leo was the first officially OpenSoftware version of Leo. The first functional version of Leo in Python was 0.05 alpha, December 17, 2001.

In October of 2001 I began work on the leo.py, an Open Software version of leo.py, a version of Leo written in Python and Tk.  At last I have found the proper platform for Leo.  leo.py naturally supports scripting in Python.  The combination of Python and Tk is incredibly powerful, very easy to use, and truly cross platform.  I rewrote Leo in Python in about two months!  For the first time in my career I no longer am anxious while programming; it simply isn't possible to create bad bugs in Python.

Tk was officially retired in June 2011.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.5">I registered the Leo project on SourceForge on March 10, 2003. Leo started a new life shortly thereafter. Prior to SourceForge my interest in Leo had been waning.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.6">In the summer of 2001 I began to consider using sentinel lines in external files. Previously I had thought that outline structure must be 'protected' by remaining inside .leo files. Accepting the possibility that sentinels might be corrupted opened vast new design possibilities. In retrospect, problems with sentinels almost never happen, but that wasn't obvious at the time! The result of this design was known then as Leo2. That terminology is extinct. I think of this version as the first version to support @file and automatic tangling and untangling.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.7">The biggest surprise in Leo's history was the realization it is **much** easier to untangle files derived from @file. Indeed, the old tangle code created all sorts of problems that just disappear when using @file. The new Python version of Leo became fully operational in early 2002. It was probably about this time that I chose noweb as Leo's preferred markup language. My decision not to support noweb's escape sequences made Leo's read code much more robust.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.8">I spent 2002 taking advantages of Python's tremendous power and safety. Many improvements were at last easy enough to do:

- Nested @others directives appeared in 3.2.
- Unicode support started in 3.3.
- @first and @last appeared in 3.7
- @asis and @nosent appeared in 3.8.
- Incremental syntax coloring and incremental undo appeared in 3.9.
- Paul Paterson created Leo's plugin architecture sometime during this period.
- 3.12 fixed a huge memory leak.
- 3.12 Final, the last 3.x version, appeared July 17, 2003.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.9">In late 2002 and throughout 2003 I worked on an entirely new file format. 4.0 final went out the door October 17, 2003.

Version 4.0 is a major advance in Leo's error handling. Using 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions. The new read code makes no changes to the outline until it is known that no read errors have occurred.

This was a time of intense design work trying to improve error recovery scheme used while reading external files. In the summer of 2003 I realized that orphan and @ignore'd nodes must be prohibited in @file trees. With this restriction, Leo could finally recreate @file trees in outlines using **only** the information in external files. This made the read code much more robust, and eliminated all the previous unworkable error recovery schemes. At last Leo was on a completely firm foundation.

Leo's read code now writes a message to the log pane whenever it sees that the body text in the external file does not match the body text in the outline. These messages do not indicate errors, only that the body text has been changed outside of Leo.

Leo's read code now warns if any non-empty node is unvisited. This check, and the check that headlines match pretty much guarantees that out-of-sync outlines will generate errors. Thus, there is no need a gnx timestamp in @+leo sentinels!

::

    - Added support for uA's
    - Eliminated child indices, extraneous blank lines and @body sentinels
    - Eliminated @node sentinels
    - New @nl and @nonl sentinels
    - Read errors leave the outline completely unchanged
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903074833">Plugins and other scripts can register event handlers (also known as hooks)::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("after-create-leo-frame",onCreate)
    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle) 
    leoPlugins.registerHandler(("start2","open2","command2"), create_open_with_menu) 

As shown above, a plugin may register one or more event handlers with a single call to leoPlugins.registerHandler. Once a hook is registered, Leo will call the registered function' at the named **hook time**. For example::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle)

causes Leo to call on_idle at "idle" time.

Event handlers must have the following signature::

    def myHook (tag, keywords):
        whatever

- tag is the name of the hook (a string).
- keywords is a Python dictionary containing additional information. The following section describes the contents of the keywords dictionary in detail.

**Important**: hooks should get the proper commander this way::

    c = keywords.get('c')
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903074833.1">The following table tells about each event handler: its name, when it is called,
and the additional arguments passed to the hook in the keywords dictionary.
For some kind of hooks, Leo will skip its own normal processing if the hook
returns anything *other* than None. The table indicates such hooks with 'yes' in
the 'Stop?' column.

**Important**: Ever since Leo 4.2, the v, old_v and new_v keys in
the keyword dictionary contain *positions*, not vnodes. These keys are
deprecated. The new_c key is also deprecated. Plugins should use the c key instead.

============================= ======== =================================== =============================

**Notes**:

1.  'activate' and 'deactivate' hooks have been removed because they do not work as expected.

2.  'commands' hooks: The label entry in the keywords dict contains the
    'canonicalized' form of the command, that is, the lowercase name of the command
    with all non-alphabetic characters removed.
    Commands hooks now set the label for undo and redo commands 'undo' and 'redo'
    rather than 'cantundo' and 'cantredo'.

3.  'menu1' hook: Setting g.app.realMenuNameDict in this hook is an easy way of
    translating menu names to other languages. **Note**: the 'new' names created this
    way affect only the actual spelling of the menu items, they do *not* affect how
    you specify shortcuts settings, nor do they affect the 'official'
    command names passed in g.app.commandName. For example::

        app().realMenuNameDict['Open...'] = 'Ouvre'.

4.  'open1' and 'open2' hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing the following entries:

    - c:          The commander of the newly opened window.
    - old_c:      The commander of the previously open window.
    - new_c:      (deprecated: use 'c' instead) The commander of the newly opened window.
    - fileName:   The name of the file being opened.

    You can use old_c.p and c.p to get the current position in the old and new windows.
    Leo calls the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks only if the file is not already open. Leo
    will also call the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks if: a) a file is opened using the
    Recent Files menu and b) the file is not already open.

5.  '@url1' and '@url2' hooks are only executed if the 'icondclick1' hook returns None.

6.  These hooks are useful for testing.

7.  These hooks allow plugins to parse and handle markup within doc parts,
    comments and Python ''' strings. Note that these hooks are *not* called in
    Python ''' strings. See the color_markup plugin for a complete example of how to
    use these hooks.

8.  Leo calls the 'create-optional-menus' hook when creating menus. This hook need
    only create new menus in the correct order, without worrying about the placement
    of the menus in the menu bar. See the plugins_menu and scripts_menu plugins for
    examples of how to use this hook.

9.  The New command calls 'new'.
    The 'new_c' key is deprecated.  Use the 'c' key instead.

10. g.scanDirectives calls 'scan-directives' hook.
    g.scanDirectives returns a dictionary, say d.
    d.get('pluginsList') is an a list of tuples (d,v,s,k) where:

    - d is the spelling of the @directive, without the leading @.
    - v is the vnode containing the directive, _not_ the original vnode.
    - s[k:] is a string containing whatever follows the @directive.
      k has already been moved past any whitespace that follows the @directive.

    See the add_directives plugins directive for a complete example of how to use
    the 'scan-directives' hook.

11. g.app.closeLeoWindow calls the 'close-frame' hook just before
    removing the window from g.app.windowList. The hook code may remove the window
    from app.windowList to prevent g.app.closeLeoWindow from destroying the window.

12. Leo calls the 'headkey1' and 'headkey2' when the headline *might* have changed.

13. p is the new node (position) containing '@auto filename.ext'

14. The d argument to the open-with event handlers is a python
    dictionary whose keys are all the tags specified by the user in the body of the
    @openwith node.
    
The following events can *only* be called be called by minibuffer commands:

========================== ======== =====================
Event name (tag argument)  Stop?    Keys in keywords dict
========================== ======== =====================
'iconclick1'               yes      c,p,v,event (note 15)
'iconrclick1'              yes      c,p,v,event (note 15)
'iconrclick2'                       c,p,v,event (note 15)
'icondclick1'              yes      c,p,v,event (note 15)
'icondclick2'                       c,p,v,event (note 15)
========================== ======== =====================

15. The only way to trigger these event is with the following minibuffer commands::

                click-icon-box
                ctrl-click-icon
                double-click-headline
        Ctrl+F3 double-click-icon-box
                right-click-headline
                right-click-icon
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906090012">Leo (and other programs) often send more detailed error messages to stderr, the output stream that goes to the console window. In Linux and MacOS environments, python programs normally execute with the console window visible. On Windows, can run Leo with the console window visible by associating .leo files with python.exe *not* pythonw.exe.

The c.config class has the following getters.

- c.config.getBool(settingName,default=None)
- c.config.getColor(settingName)
- c.config.getDirectory(settingName)

- c.config.getInt(settingName)
- c.config.getLanguage(settingName)

These methods return None if no setting exists.

The getBool 'default' argument to getBool specifies the value to be returned if the setting does not exist.

<t tx="ekr.20060105214753">Leo now allows you to specify input modes. You enter mode x with the enter-x-mode command. The purpose of a mode is to create different bindings for keys within a mode. Often plain keys are useful in input modes.

You can specify modes with @mode nodes in leoSettings.leo. @mode nodes work just like @shortcuts nodes, but in addition they have the side effect of creating the enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode command.

Notes:

- You can exit any mode using the keyboard-quit (Control-g) command. This is the **only** binding that is automatically created in each mode. All other bindings must be specified in the @mode node. In particular, the bindings specified in @shortcuts nodes are **not** in effect in mode (again, except for the keyboard-quit binding).

- Leo supports something akin to tab completion within modes: if you type a key that isn't bound in a mode a 'Mode' tab will appear in the log pane. This tab shows all the keys that you can type and the commands to which they are bound. The mode-help command does the same thing.

- @shortcuts nodes specify the bindings for what might be called the 'top-level' mode. These are the bindings in effect when no internal state is present, for example, just after executing the keyboard-quit command.

- The top_level_unbound_key_action setting determines what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode. Leo ignores unbound keys in all other modes. The possibilities are 'insert', 'replace' and 'ignore'.

- The set-insert-mode, set-overwrite-mode and set-ignore-mode commands alter what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode.
  
- If the @mode headline contains ::, everything following the :: is the mode prompt. For example::
    
    @mode abc :: xyz
    
Creates the enter-abc-mode command, but the prompt for the command is xyz.

With all these options it should be possible to emulate the keyboard behavior of any other editor.

<t tx="ekr.20060111192108">A **dangerous** delete is a deletion of a node so that all the data in the node is deleted *everywhere* in an outline. The data is gone, to be retrieved only via undo or via backups. It may not be obvious which deletes are dangerous in an outline containing clones. Happily, there is a very simple rule of thumb::

    Deleting a non-cloned node is *always* dangerous.
    Deleting a cloned node is *never* dangerous.

We could also consider a delete to be dangerous **if it results in a node being omitted from an external file.** This can happen as follows. Suppose we have the following outline (As usual, A' indicates that A is marked with a clone mark)::

    - @file spam.py
        - A'
            - B
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B

Now suppose we clone B, and move the clone so the tree looks like this::

    - @file spam.py
        - A'
            - B'
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B'
        - B'

If (maybe much later), we eliminate B' as a child of A will get::

    - @file spam.py
        - A'
    - Projects
        - A'
        - B

B has not been destroyed, but B is gone from @file spam.py! So in this sense deleting a clone node can also be called dangerous.

<t tx="ekr.20060430220749">.. _jEdit: http://www.jedit.org/
.. _`jEdit's documentation`: http://www.jedit.org/42docs/users-guide/writing-modes-part.html

The `jEdit`_ editor drives its syntax colorer using xml **language description files.** Rather than using the xml language description files directly, Leo uses Python **colorer control files**, created automatically from the xml files by a script called jEdit2Py.  All these files reside in the leo/modes directory.

These Python files contain all the information in the jEdit's xml files, so we can (loosely) speak of modes, rulesets, rules, properties and attributes in the Python colorer control files. Later sections of this documentation will make this loose correspondence exact.

`jEdit's documentation`_ contain a complete description of these xml files. Each xml file describes one **colorizing mode**. A mode consists of one or more **rulesets**, and each ruleset consists of a list of **colorizing rules**. In addition, modes, rulesets and rules may have associated **properties** and **attributes**. Various rules may specify that the colorizer uses another ruleset (either in the same mode or another mode).

**Important**: jEdit's xml language description files contain no explicit &lt;RULE&gt; elements Rules are simply sub-elements of an enclosing &lt;RULES&gt; element. The element indicates the kind of rule that is specified, for example, &lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;SEQ&gt;, etc. By the term **rule element** we shall mean any sub-element of the &lt;RULES&gt; element.

**Important**: throughout this documentation, **x.py** will refer to the Python colorer for language x, and **x.xml** will refer to the corresponding xml language-description file.

Using Python colorer control files has the following advantages:

- Running jEdit2Py need only be done when x.xml changes, and the speed of the xml parser in jEdit2Py does not affect the speed of Leo's colorizer in any way. Moreover, the jEdit2Py script can contain debugging traces and checks.

- Colorer control files are valid .py files, so all of Python's import optimizations work as usual. In particular, all the data in colorer control files is immediately accessible to Leo's colorer.

- Colorer control files are easier for humans to understand and modify than the equivalent xml file. Furthermore, it is easy to insert debugging information into Python colorer control files.

- It is easy to modify the Python colorer control files 'by hand' without changing the corresponding xml file. In particular, it would be easy to define entirely new kinds of pattern-matching rules in Python merely by creating functions in a colorer control file.

Controlling Syntax Coloring
###########################

This chapter discusses the settings to control Leo's syntax colorer. This chapter also discusses how to extend Leo's colorizer by creating xml language descriptions files and corresponding Python files. **Important**: this material is for those who want to support Leo's colorizing code. To use Leo's colorizers you only need to know about syntax-coloring settings.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502084233">When Leo's syntax colorer sees the '@language x' directive, it will import x.py from Leo's modes folder. The colorer can then access any module-level object obj in x.py as x.obj.

Colorizer control files contain **rules functions** corresponding to rule elements in x.xml. The colorizer can call these functions as if they were members of the colorizer class by passing 'self' as the first argument of these functions. I call these rules *functions* to distinguish them from the corresponding **rules methods** which are actual methods of the colorizer class. Rules *functions* merely call corresponding rules *methods*. Indeed, rules functions are simply a way of binding values to keyword arguments of rules methods. These keywords arguments correspond to the xml attributes of rule elements in x.xml.

The colorizer calls rules functions until one matches, at which point a range of text gets colored and the process repeats. The inner loop of the colorizer is this code::

    for f in self.rulesDict.get(s[i],[]):
        n = f(self,s,i)
        if n &gt; 0:
            i += n ; break
        else: i += 1

- rulesDict is a dictionary whose keys are rulesets and whose values are ruleset dictionaries.
  Ruleset dictionaries have keys that are single characters and whose values are
  the list of rules that can start with that character. 

- s is the full text to be colorized.

- i is the position within s is to be colorized.

Rules methods (and functions) return n &gt; 0 if they match, and n == 0 if they fail.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502084233.1">The following sections describe the top-level data in x.py.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516">**x.properties** is a Python dictionary corresponding to the &lt;PROPS&gt; element in x.xml. Keys are property names; values are strings, namely the contents of &lt;PROPERTY&gt; elements in x.xml. x.properties contains properties for the entire mode. That is, only modes have &lt;PROPS&gt; elements. For example, here is x.properties in php.py::

    # properties for mode php.xml
    properties = {
        "commentEnd": "--&gt;",
        "commentStart": "&lt;!--",
        "indentCloseBrackets": "}",
        "indentOpenBrackets": "{",
        "lineUpClosingBracket": "true",
    }
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516.1">x.py contains a **keyword dictionary** for each ruleset in x.xml. x.py contains an empty keywords dictionary if a ruleset contains no &lt;KEYWORDS&gt; element.

Keys are strings representing keywords of the language describe by the mode. Values are strings representing syntactic categories, i.e. a TYPE attribute valid in x.xml, namely: COMMENT1, COMMENT2, COMMENT3, COMMENT4, FUNCTION, KEYWORD1, KEYWORD2, KEYWORD3, KEYWORD4, LABEL, LITERAL1, LITERAL2, LITERAL3, LITERAL4, MARKUP, NULL and OPERATOR.

For example, here (parts of) some keyword dictionaries in php.py::

    # Keywords dict for mode php::PHP
    php_PHP_keywords_dict = {
        "COM_invoke": "keyword2",
        "COM_load": "keyword2",
        "__CLASS__": "keyword3",
        ...
        "abs": "keyword2",
        "abstract": "keyword1",
        "accept_connect": "keyword2",
        ...
    }

    # Keywords dict for mode php::JAVASCRIPT_PHP
    php_JAVASCRIPT_PHP_keywords_dict = {}

    # Keywords dict for mode php::PHPDOC
    php_PHPDOC_keywords_dict = {
        "@abstract": "label",
        "@access": "label",
        "@author": "label",
        ...
        "@var": "label",
        "@version": "label",
    }

x.py also contains **x.keywordsDictDict**. Keys are ruleset names, values are keywords dictionaries. Here is keywordsDictDict for php.py::

    # Dictionary of keywords dictionaries for php mode.
    keywordsDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": php_javascript_keywords_dict,
        "php_javascript_php": php_javascript_php_keywords_dict,
        "php_main": php_main_keywords_dict,
        "php_php": php_php_keywords_dict,
        "php_php_literal": php_php_literal_keywords_dict,
        "php_phpdoc": php_phpdoc_keywords_dict,
        "php_tags": php_tags_keywords_dict,
        "php_tags_literal": php_tags_literal_keywords_dict,
    }

The colorizer can get the keywords dictionary for a ruleset as follows::

    keywordsDict = x.keywordsDictDict(rulesetName)

**Note**: The jEdit2Py script creates 'friendly' names for keyword dictionaries *solely* as an aid for people reading the code. Leo's colorer uses only the name x.keywordsDictDict; Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of keywords dictionaries such as php_PHPDOC_keywords_dict.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516.2">x.py contains one **rule function** for every rule in every ruleset (&lt;RULES&gt; element) in x.xml. These rules have names rule1 through  ruleN, where N is the total number of rules in all rulesets in x.xml.

Each rules *function* merely calls a rules *method* in Leo's colorizer. Which method gets called depends on the corresponding element in `x.xml`. For example, the first rule in php.xml is::

    &lt;SPAN TYPE="MARKUP" DELEGATE="PHP"&gt;
		&lt;BEGIN&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/BEGIN&gt;
		&lt;END&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/END&gt;
	&lt;/SPAN&gt;

and the corresponding rule function is::

    def php_rule0(colorer, s, i):
        return colorer.match_span(s, i, kind="markup", begin="&lt;?php", end="?&gt;",
            at_line_start=False, at_whitespace_end=False, at_word_start=False,
            delegate="PHP",exclude_match=False,
            no_escape=False, no_line_break=False, no_word_break=False)


php_rule0 calls colorer.match_span because the corresponding xml rule is a &lt;SPAN&gt; element.

For each ruleset, x.py also contains a **rules dictionary**, a Python dictionary whose keys are characters and whose values are all lists of rules functions that that can match the key. For example::

    # Rules dict for phpdoc ruleset.
    rulesDict8 = {
        "*": [rule64,],
        "0": [rule70,],
        "1": [rule70,],
        "2": [rule70,],
        "3": [rule70,],
        "4": [rule70,],
        "5": [rule70,],
        "6": [rule70,],
        "7": [rule70,],
        "8": [rule70,],
        "9": [rule70,],
        "&lt;": [rule65,rule66,rule67,rule68,rule69,],
        "@": [rule70,],
        "A": [rule70,],
        "B": [rule70,],
        ...
        "X": [rule70,],
        "Y": [rule70,],
        "Z": [rule70,],
        "_": [rule70,],
        "a": [rule70,],
        "b": [rule70,],
       ...
        "x": [rule70,],
        "y": [rule70,],
        "z": [rule70,],
        "{": [rule63,],
    }

**Note**: The order of rules in each rules list is important; it should be the same as rules element in x.xml.

Finally, x.py contains **x.rulesDictDict**. Keys are ruleset names, values are rules dictionaries. The colorer can get the rules list for character ch as follows::

    self.rulesDict = x.rulesDictDict.get(rulesetName) # When a mode is inited.
    ...
    rules = self.rulesDict.get(ch,[]) # In the main loop.

For example, here is the rules dictionary for php.py::

    # x.rulesDictDict for php mode.
    rulesDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": rulesDict6,
        "php_javascript_php": rulesDict7,
        "php_main": rulesDict1,
        "php_php": rulesDict4,
        "php_php_literal": rulesDict5,
        "php_phpdoc": rulesDict8,
        "php_tags": rulesDict2,
        "php_tags_literal": rulesDict3,
    }

**Note**: The jEdit2Py script creates 'friendly' names for rules lists *solely* as an aid for people reading the code. Leo's colorer uses only the name x.rulesDictDict; Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of rules lists such as rulesDict8, and Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of rules functions such as rule64.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502100550">A **ruleset name** is a Python string having the form 'x_setname', where setname is the value of the SET attribute of the &lt;RULES&gt; element in x.xml. For example, the ruleset name of the ruleset whose SET attribute is JAVASCRIPT in php.xml is 'php_JAVASCRIPT'. **Important**: by convention, the ruleset name of the default &lt;RULES&gt; element is 'x_main'; note that default &lt;RULES&gt; element have no SET attributes.

The colorizer uses ruleset names to gain access to all data structures in x.py. To anticipate a bit, ruleset names are keys into two standard dictionaries, x.rulesDict and x.keywordsDictDict, from which the colorizer can get all other information in x.py::

    # The rules list for the 'JAVASCRIPT' ruleset in php.xml.
    rules = x.rulesDict('php_JAVASCRIPT')

    # The keywords dict for the 'JAVASCRIPT' ruleset in php.xml.
    keywordsDict = x.keywordsDictDict('php_JAVASCRIPT')

In fact, ruleset names (and x.rulesDict and x.keywordsDictDict) are the **only** names that the colorizer needs to know in order to access all information in x.py.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502122950">This section describes each rules method in Leo's new colorizer. Rules methods are called by rules functions in colorizer control file; they correspond directly to rules elements in jEdit's language description files. In fact, this documentation is a 'refactoring' of `jEdit's documentation`_.

All rule methods attempt to match a pattern at a particular spot in a string. These methods all return True if the match succeeds.

<t tx="ekr.20060503064515">.. _`Ruleset name`: `Ruleset names`_

All rule methods take three required arguments and zero or more optional keyword arguments.

Here is a list of the required arguments and their meaning:

- **self**: An instance of Leo's colorizer.

- **s**: The string in which matches may be found.

- **i**: The location within the string at which the rule method looks for a match.

Here is a list of all optional keyword arguments and their meaning:

- **at_line_start**:
  If True, a match will succeed only if i is at the start of a line.

- **at_whitespace_end**:
  If True, the match will succeed only if i is at the first non-whitespace text in a line.

- **at_word_start**:
  If True, the match will succeed only if i is at the beginning of a word.

- **delegate**:
  If non-empty, the value of this argument is a `ruleset name`_.
  If the match succeeds, the matched text will be colored recursively with the indicate ruleset.

- **exclude_match**:
  If True, the actual text that matched will not be colored.
  The meaning of this argument varies slightly depending on whether one or two sequences are matched.
  See the individual rule methods for details.

- **kind**: A string representing a class of tokens, i.e., one of:
  'comment1', 'comment2', 'comment3', 'comment4', 'function',
  'keyword1', 'keyword2', 'keyword3', 'keyword4',
  'label', 'literal1', 'literal2', 'literal3', 'literal4',
  'markup', 'null' and 'operator'.

- **no_escape**:
  If True, the ruleset's escape character will have no effect before the end argument to match_span.
  Otherwise, the presence of the escape character will cause that occurrence of the end string to be ignored.

- **no_line_break**:
  If True, the match will not succeed across line breaks.

- **no_word_break**:
  If True, the match will not cross word breaks.

New in Leo 4.4.1 final: the regular expression rule matchers no longer get a hash_char argument
because such matchers are called only if the present search pattern starts with hash_char.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060503072213">x.importDict is a Python dictionary. Keys are ruleset names; values are a list of ruleset names. For example::

    # Import dict for php mode.
    importDict = {
        "php_javascript_php": ["javascript::main"],
    }

For any ruleset R whose ruleset name is N, x.importDict.get(N) is the list of rulesets names whose rulesets appear in a DELEGATE attribute of an &lt;IMPORT&gt; rule element in R's ruleset. Such **imported** ruleset are copied to the end of the R's rules list. Leo's colorizer does this copying only once, when loading ruleset R for the first time.

**Note 1**: Loading imported rulesets must be done at 'run time'. It should definitely not be done by jEdit2Py at 'compile time'; that would require running jEdit2Py on *all* .xml files whenever any such file changed.

**Note 2**:  Multiple &lt;IMPORT&gt; rule elements in a single ruleset are allowed: delegated rules are copied to the end of N's rules list in the order they appear in the ruleset.

**Note 3**: The DELEGATE attribute of &lt;IMPORT&gt; elements is, in fact, completely separate from the DELEGATE attributes of other rules as discussed in `Arguments to rule methods`_. Indeed, the DELEGATE attribute of &lt;IMPORT&gt; elements creates entries in x.importDict, which in turn causes the colorizer to append the rules of the imported ruleset to the end of the present rules list. In contrast, the DELEGATE attributes of other rules sets the delegate argument to rules methods, which in tern causes the colorizer to recursively color the matched text with the **delegated** ruleset. In short:

- The rules of **imported** rulesets are appended to the end of another rules list; the rules of **delegated** rulesets never are.

- **Imported** ruleset names appear as the values of items in x.importDict; **delegated** ruleset names appear as delegate arguments to rule methods.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060510085547">x.py contains a **attribute dictionary** for each ruleset in x.xml. Keys are attribute names, values strings representing the values of the attributes. This dictionary is empty if a ruleset contains no attributes. The valid keys are:

- 'default': the default token type.  'null' is the default.

- 'digit_re': a regular expression.
  Words matching this regular expression are colored with the digit token type.

- 'ignore_case': 'true' or 'false'.  Default is 'true'.

- 'highlight_digits': 'true' or 'false'.  Default is 'true'.

- 'no_word_sep': A list of characters treated as 'alphabetic' characters when matching keywords.

For example, here is one attribute dictionary in php.py::

    # Attributes dict for php_javascript ruleset.
    php_javascript_attributes_dict = {
        "default": "MARKUP",
        "digit_re": "",
        "highlight_digits": "true",
        "ignore_case": "true",
        "no_word_sep": "",
    }

x.py also contains **x.attributesDictDict**. Keys are ruleset names, values are attribute dictionaries. Here is attributesDictDict for php.py::

    # Dictionary of attributes dictionaries for php mode.
    attributesDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": php_javascript_attributes_dict,
        "php_javascript_php": php_javascript_php_attributes_dict,
        "php_main": php_main_attributes_dict,
        "php_php": php_php_attributes_dict,
        "php_php_literal": php_php_literal_attributes_dict,
        "php_phpdoc": php_phpdoc_attributes_dict,
        "php_tags": php_tags_attributes_dict,
        "php_tags_literal": php_tags_literal_attributes_dict,
    }

**Note**: The jEdit2Py script creates 'friendly' names for attribute dictionaries *solely* as an aid for people reading the code. Leo's colorer uses only the name x.attributeDictDict; Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of attribute dictionaries.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060527103630">A new method has been added to make it more easily to write rST code from scripts::

    c.rstCommands.writeNodeToString(p)

``writeNodeToString`` scans p's tree (p defaults to presently selected node) looking for @rst nodes. When the first @rst node is found, writeNodeToString processes the node as usual, with the following changes:

- @rst need not be followed by a filename; any filename and its extension are *ignored*.

- Only the ext argument to writeNodeToString determines the type of output produced. The valid values for the ext argument are None (for rst output), '.html', '.pdf', and '.tex'.

- Instead of writing the result to a file, writeNodeToString returns the tuple (p,s), where p is the node whose tree produced the output, and s is the output itself.

- writeNodeToString returns after processing at most one @rst node.

Scripts can easily use writeNodeToString to convert @rst trees into various kinds of output. For example::

    p,s = c.rstCommands.writeNodeToString(p,ext='html')

Notes:

- This script scans the presently selected tree for @rst nodes. In particular, if the presently selected tree does not contain an @rst node the search continues in parent trees. When an @rst node is found, it converts the node (and descendants) to html and returns p, the found @rst node and s, the html itself.

- Valid values for the ext argument are ".html", ".tex" or None (specifies rst output)

- There is some support for ext=".pdf", but this is experimental code.  Expect crashes.

    @string debugger_kind = winpdb

This setting controls what debugger the 'Debug Script' script button uses. Eventually this setting will control what debugger the debug command uses:: At present the only valid value is 'winpdb'

    @bool write_script_file = True

True: The execute script command writes the script to be executed to a file, then executes the script using Python's execFile function. The script_file_path setting specifies the path to this file. False (legacy): The execute script command uses Python's exec command to execute the script.

@string script_file_path = ../test/scriptFile.py

The path to the file to be written by the execute-script command. Notes:

- This setting has effect only if the write_script_file setting is True.
- Use / as the path delimiter, regardless of platform.
- The default path is ../test/scriptFile.py if no path is given.
- The path starts at g.app.loadDir, so for example ../test/scriptFile.py is equivalent to leo/test/scriptFile.py.
- The filename should end in .py.

<t tx="ekr.20060529053407">@ignore can only be used in the root node of @file trees.  It tells Leo to ignore the tree.

The @ignore directive can not be used elsewhere in @file trees because of the way Leo recreates outlines from external files. This is an absolutely crucial restriction and will never go away. For a few more details, see `Leo 4.0: Eliminating error 'recovery'`_ in `History of Leo`_.

There are several workaround, as shown in LeoPy.leo:

- keep notes in the outline outside of any external file.

- Use @all to gather notes in a external file, as in done in @file leoProjects.txt.

.. _`Scripting Leo with Python`: tutorial-scripting.html

Plugins modify how Leo works. With plugins you can give Leo new commands,
modify how existing commands work, or change any other aspect of Leo's look
and feel.

leoPlugins.leo contains all of Leo's official plugins. Studying this file is
a good way to learn how to write plugins.

Writing plugins is like writing any other Leo script.  See
`Scripting Leo with Python`_. In particular:

1. Plugins can use any of Leo's source code simply by importing any module
   defined in leoPy.leo.

2. Plugins can register event handlers just like any other Leo script. For full
   details, see the section called `Handling Events`_ later in this chapter.

The rest of this chapters discusses topics related specifically to plugins.

<t tx="ekr.20060629083935">Leo 4.4 Final was released May 11, 2006.  It completed a year-long effort to incorporate an Emacs-style minibuffer and related commands into Leo. Leo 4.4 also featured many improvements in how keys are bound to commands, including per-pane bindings and user-defined key-binding modes. These features allow users to emulate Emacs, Vim, or any other editor. They also make it easy to use Leo without a mouse.

This release created many Emacs-like commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring, regions and rectangles. Much of the work started with a prototype by LeoUser (B.H).

2. Find the node 'Keyboard shortcuts'.

3. Disable the old bindings by moving the node '@keys EKR bindings: Emacs keys + modes' so that it is a child of the node: '@ignore Unused key bindings'.

4. Notice that there are two child nodes of the node '@ignore Unused key bindings' that refer to legacy key bindings:

   - '@keys Legacy Leo shortcuts with important Emacs bindings'

   - '@keys Legacy Leo bindings'.

5. Move **one** of these two legacy nodes up one level so that it is a child of the node 'Keyboard shortcuts'. It should **not** be a child of the node '@ignore Unused key bindings'.

    null_font, and operator_font.
    
To specify a color, say for comment1, for *all* languages, create an @color node::

    @color comment1_color = blue
    
To specify a color for a **particular** language, say Python, prepend the setting name
with the language name.  For example::

    @color python_comment1_color = pink

To specify a font, say for keyword_font, to be used as the default font for **all** languages, put the following in the body text of an @font node in leoSettings.leo::

    # keyword_font_family = None
    keyword_font_size = 16
    keyword_font_slant = roman
        # roman, italic
    keyword_font_weight = bold
        # normal, bold

Comments are allowed and undefined settings are set to reasonable defaults. At present, comments can not follow a setting: comments must start a line.

You can specify per-language settings by preceding the settings names by a prefix x. Such settings affect only colorizing for language x (i.e., all the modes in modes/x.py when using the new colorizer). For example, to specify a font for php (only), put the following in the body text of an @font node in leoSettings.leo::

    # php_keyword_font_family = None
    php_keyword_font_size = 16
    php_keyword_font_slant = roman
        # roman, italic
    php_keyword_font_weight = bold
        # normal, bold

To enable zodb scripting within Leo, you must set use_zodb = True in the root node of leoNodes.py. You must also install ZODB itself.  See `Installing ZODB`_ for details.

When ZODB is installed and use_zodb is True, Leo's vnode class becomes a subclass of ZODB.Persistence.Persistent. This is all that is needed to save/retrieve vnodes or tnodes to/from the ZODB.

**Important notes**:

- Scripts **should not** store or retrieve positions using the ZODB! Doing so makes sense neither from Leo's point of view nor from ZODB's point of view.

- The examples below show how to store or retrieve Leo data by accessing the so-called root of a ZODB connection. However, these are only examples. Scripts are free to do with Leo's vnodes *anything* that can be done with ZODB.Persistence.Persistent objects.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403">Scripts should call g.init_zodb to open a ZODB.Storage file. g.init_zodb returns an instance of ZODB.DB.  For example::

    db = g.init_zodb (zodbStorageFileName)

You can call g.init_zodb as many times as you like. Only the first call for any path actually does anything: subsequent calls for a previously opened path simply return the same value as the first call.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403.1">The following script writes v, a tree of vnodes, to zodb::

    db = g.init_zodb (zodbStorageFileName)
    connection = db.open()
    try:
        root = connection.root()
        root[aKey] = v # See next section for how to define aKey.
    finally:
        get_transaction().commit()
        connection.close()

Notes:

- v must be a vnode.
  Scripts should *not* attempt to store Leo positions in the zodb.
  v can be the root of an entire outline or a subtree.
  For example, either of the following would be reasonable::

    root[aKey] = c.rootPosition().v
    root[aKey] = c.p.v

- To write a single vnode without writing any of its children you can use v.detach.
  For example::

    root[aKey] = v.detach()

- **Important**: It is simplest if only one zodb connection is open at any one time,
  so scripts would typically close the zodb connection immediately after processing the data.
  The correct way to do this is in a finally statement, as shown above.

- The script above does not define aKey.
  The following section discusses how to define reasonable zodb keys.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403.2">The following script reads a tree of vnodes from zodb and sets p as the root position of the tree::

    try:
        connection = db.open()
        root = connection.root()
        v = root.get(aKey)
        p = leoNodes.position(v)
    finally:
        get_transaction().commit()
        connection.close()
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913175437">The keys used to store and retrieve data in connection.root() can be any string that uniquely identifies the data. The following are only suggestions; you are free to use any string you like.

1. When saving a file, you would probably use a key that is similar to a real file path.
   For example::

        aKey = c.fileName()

2. When saving a single vnode or tree of vnodes, say v,
   a good choice would be to use v's gnx, namely::

        aKey = g.app.nodeIndices.toString(v.fileIndex)

   Note that v.detach() does not automatically copy v.fileIndex to the detached node,
   so when writing a detached node you would typically do the following::

       v2 = v.detach()
       v2.fileIndex = v.fileIndex
       aKey = g.app.nodeIndices.toString(v2.fileIndex)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913175437.1">The scripts shown above close the zodb connection after processing the data. This is by far the simplest strategy. I recommend it for typical scripts.

**Important**: you must **leave the connection open** if your script modifies persistent data in any way. (Actually, this statement is not really true, but you must define zodb transaction managers if you intend to use multiple connections simultaneously. This complication is beyond the scope of this documentation.) For example, it would be possible to create a new Leo outline from the data just read, but the script must leave the connection open. I do not recommend this tactic, but for the adventurous here is some sample code::

    connection = self.db.open()
    root = connection.root()
    v = root.get(fileName)
    if v:
        c2 = c.new()
        c2.openDirectory = c.openDirectory # A hack.
        c2.mFileName = fileName # Another hack.
        c2.beginUpdate()
        try:
            c2.setRootVnode(v)
            c2Root = c2.rootPosition()
            c2.atFileCommands.readAll(c2Root)
            g.es_print('zodb read: %s' % (fileName))
        finally:
            c2.endUpdate()
        # Do *not* close the connection while the new Leo window is open!
    else:
        g.es_print('zodb read: not found: %s' % (fileName))


This will work **provided** that no other zodb connection is ever opened while this connection is opened. Unless special zodb precautions are taken (like defining zodb transaction managers) calling get_transaction().commit() will affect **all** open connections. You have been warned.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060915112109">Find the @file leoApp.py node in leoPy.leo. In the ctor for the LeoApp class set self.use_psyco to True or False. You will find this ctor in the node::

    Code--&gt;Core classes...--&gt;@file leoApp.py--&gt;app.__init__

Note that this ivar can not be set using settings in leoSettings.leo because Leo uses g.app.use_psyco before processing configuration settings.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060917130130">Add the following as the *very first line* of your scripts::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Without this line, constructs such as::

    u = u'a-(2 unicode characters here)-z'
    u = 'a-(2 unicode characters here)-z'

will not work when executed with Leo's execute script command. Indeed, the Execute Script command creates the script by writing the tree containing the script to a string. This is done using Leo's write logic, and this logic converts the unicode input to a utf-8 encoded string. So *all non-ascii characters* get converted to their equivalent in the utf-8 encoding. Call these encoding &lt;e1&gt; and &lt;e2&gt;. In effect the script becomes::

    u = u'a-&lt;e1&gt;-&lt;e2&gt;-z'
    u = 'a-&lt;e2&gt;-&lt;e&gt;-z'

which is certainly *not* what the script writer intended! Rather than defining strings using actual characters, Instead, one should use the equivalent escape sequences. For example::

    u = u'a-\\u0233-\\u8ce2-z'
    u = 'a-\\u0233-\\u8ce2-z'
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060921064744.1">.. _`sentinel lines`: glossary.html#sentinel-lines

This section describe the format of external files. Leo's `sentinel lines`_ are comments, and this section describes those comments.

.. index:: gnx

External files created by @file use gnx's in @+node sentinels. Such gnx's permanently and uniquely identify nodes. Gnx's have the form::

    id.yyyymmddhhmmss
    id.yyyymmddhhmmss.n

The second form is used if two gnx's would otherwise be identical.

- id is a string unique to a developer, e.g., a git id.

- yyyymmddhhmmss is the node's creation date.

- n is an integer.

Closing sentinels are required for section references and the @all and @others directives, collectively known as **embedding constructs.** Proof: These constructs do not terminate the node in which they appear. Without a closing sentinel there would be no way to know where the construct ended and the following lines of the enclosing node began.

New sentinels do not include @nonl or @nl. As a result, body text always ends with at least one newline.

Here are the sentinels used by Leo, in alphabetical order. Unless otherwise noted, the documentation applies to all versions of Leo. In the following discussion, gnx denotes a gnx as described above.

\@&lt;&lt;
    A sentinel of the form @&lt;&lt;section_name&gt;&gt; represents a section reference.

    If the reference does not end the line, the sentinel line ending
    the expansion is followed by the remainder of the reference line.
    This allows the Read code to recreate the reference line exactly.

\@@
    The @@ sentinel represents any line starting with @ in body text
    except @*whitespace*, @doc and @others.
    Examples::

      @@nocolor
      @@pagewidth 80
      @@tabwidth 4
      @@code

\@afterref
    Marks non-whitespace text appearing after a section references.

\@+all
    Marks the start of text generated by the @all directive.

\@-all
    Marks the end of text generated by the @all directive.

\@at and @doc

    The @+doc @+at sentinels indicate the start of a doc parts.

..  Officially retired in Leo 5.7.4.
..  We use the following **trailing whitespace convention** to
..  determine where putDocPart has inserted line breaks::
..      A line in a doc part is followed by an inserted newline
..      if and only if the newline if preceded by whitespace.
..  To make this convention work, Leo's write code deletes the trailing
..  whitespace of all lines that are followed by a "real" newline.

\@+body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the start of body text.

\@-body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the end of body text.

\@delims
    The @delims directive inserts @@delims sentinels into the
    external file. The new delimiter strings continue in effect until
    the next @@delims sentinel *in the external file* or until the
    end of the external file. Adding, deleting or changing @@delim
    *sentinels* will destroy Leo's ability to read the external file.
    Mistakes in using the @delims *directives* have no effect on Leo,
    though such mistakes will thoroughly mess up a external file as
    far as compilers, HTML renderers, etc. are concerned.

\@+leo
    Marks the start of any external file. This sentinel has the form::

        &lt;opening_delim&gt;@leo&lt;closing_delim&gt;

    The read code uses single-line comments if &lt;closing_delim&gt; is empty.
    The write code generates single-line comments if possible.

    The @+leo sentinel contains other information. For example::

        &lt;opening_delim&gt;@leo-ver=4-thin&lt;closing_delim&gt;

\@-leo
    Marks the end of the Leo file.
    Nothing but whitespace should follow this directive.

\@+middle **(Created in Leo 4.0, removed in Leo 5.3)**

\@-middle **(Created in Leo 4.0, removed in Leo 5.3)**
    Marks the start/end of intermediate nodes between the node that
    references a section and the node that defines the section.
    
    These sentinels were a **mistake** that created bugs.  See:
    https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/132
    
\@nl **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Insert a newline in the outline.

\@+node
    Mark the start and end of a node::

        @+node:gnx:&lt;headline&gt;
        
\@nonl **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Suppresses a newline in the outline.

\@others
    The @+others sentinel indicates the start of the expansion of an @+others          
    directive, which continues until the matching @-others sentinel.

\@verbatim
    @verbatim indicates that the next line of the external file is not a sentinel.
    This escape convention allows body text to contain lines that would otherwise
    be considered sentinel lines.

\@@verbatimAfterRef
    @verbatimAfterRef is generated when a comment following a section reference would
    otherwise be treated as a sentinel. In Python code, an example would be::

      &lt;&lt; ref &gt;&gt; #+others

<t tx="ekr.20061025070825.1">The leoPymacs module is intended to be called from Emacs using pymacs.  It contains the following top-level functions:

- get_app()

  Returns the hidden app created by the leoPymacs.init function.

- dump(anyPythonObject)

  Returns str(repr(anyPythonObject)).

- get_g()

  Returns the leoGlobals module of the hidden app created by the leoPymacs.init function.

- get_script_result()

  Returns g.app.scriptResult, where g.app is the hidden app.

- init()
  Calls leo.run(pymacs=True) to create a hidden Leo application.
  Later calls to open can open hidden Leo outlines that can be accessed via runScript.

- open(fileName)

  Opens the .leo file given by fileName. fileName must be the full
  path to a .leo file. Returns the commander of the open Leo outline,
  or None if the outline could not be opened.

- run_script(c,script,p=None)

  Executes a script in the context of a commander c returned by the leoPymacs.open.
  c may be None, in which case a dummy commander is created in which to run the script.
  In the executed script, p is set to c.p if no p argument is specified.

<t tx="ekr.20061025081359">.. _`pymacs`:   http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/index.html
.. _`elisp`:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp
.. _`Emacs`:    http://www.xemacs.org/

Leo's leoPymacs module is a simple 'server' for the `pymacs`_ package. Using pymacs and leoPymacs, `elisp`_ scripts in `Emacs`_ can open .leo files and execute *Python* scripts as if they were executed inside Leo. In particular, such scripts can use Leo's predefined c, g and p variables. Thus, *Python* scripts running in Emacs can:

- Open any .leo file. 
- Access any part of the outline. 
- Change any part of the outline, including external files, 
- Save .leo files.
- Execute *any* Leo script.

In short, you can now do from Emacs anything that you can do with Leo scripting inside Leo.

Here are step-by-step instructions for executing Python scripts in Emacs:

**Step 1. Install pymacs** 

   The pymacs installation instructions should be clear enough.
   A clarification is needed about two-way communication between Python and lisp scripts:
   in truth, Python scripts can call the Pymacs.lisp function *only* if the Python script
   was invoked from emacs.
   Otherwise, calling Pymacs.lisp will hang the process making the call.
   For example, executing the following script as an ordinary Leo script will hang Leo::

        from Pymacs import lisp
        print lisp("""2+2""") # Hangs

**Step 2. Load the leoPymacs module from Emacs, creating a hidden Leo application**

  From inside Emacs, you load Leo's leoPymacs module as follows::

    (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-")

  The call to pymacs-load is similar to 'import leoPymacs as leo-' in
  Python. The side effect of pymacs-load is to define the elisp
  function leo-x for every top-level function x in leoPymacs.py,
  namely leo-dump, leo-get-app, leo-get-g, leo-get-script-result,
  leo-init, leo-open and leo-run-script. The first call to any of
  these functions creates a **hidden Leo application** in which .leo
  files may be loaded, modified and saved, and in which Leo scripts
  may be executed. This hidden Leo application uses Leo's nullGui
  class as its gui, so Leo commands and Leo scripts that require a
  fully functional gui will not work as expected in the hidden Leo
  application. Steps 3 and 4 tell how to use this hidden Leo
  application.

  pymacs-load works like a Python reload, so you can redefine
  leoPymacs.py while Emacs is running. However, calling pymacs-load
  destroys the old hidden Leo application and creates a new one, so
  typically you would want to call pymacs-load only once per Emacs
  session. Like this::

        (setq reload nil) ; change nil to t to force a reload.

        (if (or reload (not (boundp 'leoPymacs)))
            (setq leoPymacs (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-"))
            (message "leoPymacs already loaded")
        )

**Step 3. From Emacs, open .leo files**

   Once we have loaded the leoPymacs module
   we can open a .leo file as follows::

    (setq c (leo-open fileName))

   This binds the elisp c variable to the Leo commander created by opening fileName.
   fileName should be the full path to a .leo file.
   In the next step we will use this c variable to execute *Leo* scripts in the
   context of an open Leo outline.

   Sometimes we want to execute a Leo script before opening any Leo commanders.
   For example, we might want to compute the fileName passed to leo-open.
   leo-run-script allows the c argument to be nil,
   in which case leo-run-script creates a dummy commander in which to run the script.
   For example, the following script calls g.os_path_join and g.os_path_abspath::

        (setq script "g.app.scriptResult =
            g.os_path_abspath(g.os_path_join(
                g.app.loadDir,'..','test','ut.leo'))"
        )

        (setq fileName (leo-run-script nil script))

   leo-run-script returns the value of g.app.scriptResult
   As shown above, Python scripts may set g.app.scriptResult to indicate their result.
   elisp scripts can also get g.app.scriptResult using leo-script-result.
   Note that the Python script may span multiple lines.

**Step 4. From Emacs, execute Leo (Python) scripts**

   From emacs we can execute a Python script **as if** it were executed in an
   open Leo outline.
   Suppose aLeoScript is an **elisp** string containing a Leo (Python) script.
   We can execute that script in the hidden Leo application as follows::

        (leo-run-script c aLeoScript)

   For example::

        (setq c (leo-open fileName)
        (csetq script "print 'c',c,'h',c.p.h")
        (leo-run-script c script)

Putting this all together, we get::

        ; Step 1: load leoPymacs if it has not already been loaded.
        (setq reload nil)
        (if (or reload (not (boundp 'leoPymacs)))
            (setq leoPymacs (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-"))
            (message "leoPymacs already loaded")
        )

        ; Step 2: compute the path to leo/test/ut.leo using a Leo script.
        (setq script
            "g.app.scriptResult = g.os_path_abspath(
                g.os_path_join(g.app.loadDir,'..','test','ut.leo'))"

<t tx="ekr.20061025142434">Leo's mini-buffer is a text area at the bottom of the body pane. You use Leo's minibuffer like the Emacs mini-buffer to invoke commands by their so-called *long name*. The following commands affect the minibuffer:

- **full-command**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Puts the focus in the minibuffer. Type a full command name, then hit &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command. Tab completion works, but not yet for file names.

- **quick-command-mode**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Like Emacs Control-C. This mode is defined in leoSettings.leo. It is useful for commonly-used commands.

- **universal-argument**: (default shortcut: Alt-u) Like Emacs Ctrl-u. Adds a repeat count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's.

- **keyboard-quit**: (default shortcut: Ctrl-g) Exits any minibuffer mode and puts the focus in the body pane.

For example, to print a list of all commands type Alt-X print-commands &lt;Return&gt;.

.. _`winpdb`: http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/

The following three section discuss three ways of debugging scripts with `winpdb`_. The first two sections tell how to debug general scripts; the last section tells how to debug Leo-specific scripts.

winpdb_ and its documentation have been improved recently. For more details, see the `embedded winpdb`_ docs. The discussion of embedded debugging may have been written specifically with Leo in mind.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.1">This way of debugging can only be used for general scripts, not leo-specific scripts. The debug command writes the script to scriptFile.py and invokes winpdb. winpdb opens and is already 'attached' to the script to be debugged. You can single-step as you like. Leo continues to run, but killing the debugger will also kill Leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.3">This way of debugging scripts allows winpdb to debug scripts that use c, g and p. A bit more work is needed because winpdb does not start automatically. Here are step-by step instructions:

1. Insert the following two lines of code at the start of the script to be debugged::

    import rpdb2
    rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger('go',fAllowUnencrypted=True)

2. Execute Leo's execute-script command (*not* the debug command). Leo will appear to hang: start_embedded_debugger is waiting for *another* copy of winpdb to 'attach' to the script's process. The default timeout is 5 minutes, after which an exception gets thrown.

3. Start winpdb explicitly by executing something like the following in a console::

    python /Python26/Scripts/_winpdb.py -t

   The -t option tells winpdb that no encoding of password is necessary.
   The password is specified in the call to rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger in your script.
   In our example, the password is 'go'.

4. Use winpdb's File:Attach command to attach winpdb to Leo. Specify the password as 'go' and you will see the scriptFile.py containing your entire script. You can now execute or single-step through the script. To repeat, c, g and p are defined, so you can debug any script this way.

Inserting g.trace statements in my Python code is usually my first debugging choice. The g.trace statement prints the name of the function in which the call to g.trace occurs, followed by the value of its arguments. The output of the g.trace goes to the console, so you must `run Leo in a console`_ to use g.trace.

Inserting and deleting g.trace statements is fast, provided that your `work flow`_ makes it easy to restart the program under test. As a result, using g.trace statements is similar to setting tracepoints in a debugger, with the advantage that (disabled) tracepoints remain in the source code for future use. You will find many examples of using g.trace throughout Leo's source code.

My second choice is using g.pdb to set breakpoints for the `pdb`_ debugger. Pdb uses the console for all interaction, so you must `run Leo in a console`_. See the `FAQ`_ for a discussion of both g.trace and g.pdb.

Embedding Leo with the leoBridge module
#######################################

The leoBridge module allows complete access to all aspects of Leo from other
Python programs running independently of Leo. Let us call such a program a
**host** program. Using the leoBridge module, host programs can get access to:

- all of Leo's source code,
- the contents of any .leo file,
- the commander of any .leo file.

.. contents:: Contents
    :depth: 2
    :local:


</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070317033759.3">Host programs use the leoBridge module as follows::

    import leo.core.leoBridge as leoBridge
    
    controller = leoBridge.controller(gui='nullGui',
        loadPlugins=True,  # True: attempt to load plugins.
        readSettings=True, # True: read standard settings files.
        silent=False,      # True: don't print signon messages.
        verbose=False)     # True: print informational messages.

    g = controller.globals()
    c = controller.openLeoFile(path)

Let us look at these statements in detail. The first two statements import the leoBridge module and create a **bridge controller**. In effect, these statements embed an invisible copy of Leo into the host program. This embedded copy of Leo uses a null gui, which simulates all aspects of Leo's normal gui code without creating any screen objects.

The statement::

    g = controller.globals()

provides access to Leo's leoGlobals module, and properly inits globals such as g.app, g.app.gui, etc. *Host programs should not import leoGlobals directly*, because doing so would not init the g.app object properly.

The statement::

    c = controller.openLeoFile(path)

invisibly opens the .leo file given by the path argument. This call returns a completely standard Leo commander, properly inited. This is the big payoff from the leoBridge module: the host program gets instant access to c.config.getBool, etc. Do you see how sweet this is?

For example, the following script runs leo/test/leoBridgeTest.py outside of Leo. leoBridgeTest.py uses the leoBridge module to run all unit tests in leo/test/unitTest.leo::

    import os,sys

    path = g.os_path_abspath(
        g.os_path_join(
            g.app.loadDir,'..','test','leoBridgeTest.py'))

    os.system('%s %s' % (sys.executable,path))

The file leo/test/test.leo contains the source code for leoBridgeTest.py. Here it is, stripped of its sentinel lines::

Unit testing with Leo

.. _`run Leo in a console window`: installing.html#running-leo-from-a-console-window

This chapter describes how you can execute Python unit test from within Leo
outlines.

Leo's **unit test commands** run the unit tests created by @test and @suite
nodes. run-unit-tests and run-unit-tests-locally run all unit tests in the
presently selected part of the Leo outline; run-all-unit-tests and
run-all-unit-tests-locally run all unit tests in the entire Leo outline.

Important: you must `run Leo in a console window`_ to see the output the
unit tests. Leo's unit test commands run all the unit tests using the
standard unittest text test runner, and the output of the unit tests
appears in the console.

test/unitTest.leo contains many examples of using @test and @suite nodes.

.. contents:: Contents
    :depth: 2
    :local:

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628084351">**@test nodes** are nodes whose headlines start with @test. The unit test commands convert the body text of @test nodes into a unit test automatically. That is, Leo's unit test commands automatically create a unittest.TestCase instances which run the body text of the @test node. For example, let us consider one of Leo's actual unit tests. The headline is::

    @test consistency of back/next links

The body text is::

    if g.unitTesting:
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional: prevents pychecker warnings.
        for p in c.all_positions():
            back = p.back()
            next = p.next()
            if back: assert(back.getNext() == p)
            if next: assert(next.getBack() == p)

When either of Leo's unit test commands finds this @test node the command will
run a unit test equivalent to the following::

    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

    class aTestCase (unittest.TestCase):
        def shortDescription():
            return '@test consistency of back/next links'
        def runTest():
            c,p = g.getTestVars()
            for p in c.all_positions():
                back = p.back()
                next = p.next()
                if back: assert(back.getNext() == p)
                if next: assert(next.getBack() == p)

As you can see, using @test nodes saves a lot of typing:

- You don't have to define a subclass of unittest.TestCase.
- Within your unit test, the c, g and p variables are predefined, just like in Leo scripts.
- The entire headline of the @test node becomes the short description of the unit test.

**Important note**: notice that the first line of the body text is a **guard line**::

    if g.unitTesting:

This guard line is needed because this particular @test node is contained in the file leoNodes.py. @test nodes that appear outside of Python source files do not need guard lines. The guard line prevents the unit testing code from being executed when Python imports the leoNodes module; the g.unitTesting variable is True only while running unit tests.

**New in Leo 4.6**: When Leo runs unit tests, Leo predefines the 'self' variable to be the instance of the test itself, that is an instance of unittest.TestCase. This allows you to use methods such as self.assertTrue in @test and @suite nodes.

**Note**: Leo predefines the c, g, and p variables in @test and @suite nodes, just like in other scripts.  Thus, the line::

    c,p = g.getTestVars()

is not needed. However, it prevents pychecker warnings that c and p are undefined.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628094515.1">**@suite nodes** are nodes whose headlines start with @suite. @suite nodes allow you to create and run custom subclasses of unittest.TestCase.

Leo's test commands assume that the body of an suite node is a script that creates a suite of tests and places that suite in g.app.scriptDict['suite']. Something like this::

    if g.unitTesting:
        __pychecker__ = '--no-reimport' # Prevents pychecker complaint.
        import unittest
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional.
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        &lt;&lt; add one or more tests (instances of unittest.TestCase) to suite &gt;&gt;
        g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite

**Note**: as in @test nodes, the guard line, 'if unitTesting:', is needed only if the
@suite node appears in a Python source file.

Leo's test commands first execute the script and then run suite in g.app.scriptDict.get('suite') using the standard unittest text runner.

You can organize the script in an @suite nodes just as usual using @others, section references, etc. For example::

    if g.unitTesting:
        __pychecker__ = '--no-reimport'
        import unittest
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional.
        # children define test1,test2..., subclasses of unittest.TestCase.
        @others 
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        for test in (test1,test2,test3,test4):
            suite.addTest(test)
        g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628094515.2">The run-all-unit-tests-locally and run-unit-tests-locally commands run unit tests in the process that is running Leo. These commands *can* change the outline containing the unit tests.

The run-all-unit-tests and run-unit-tests commands run all tests in a separate process, so unit tests can never have any side effects. These commands never changes the outline from which the tests were run. These commands do the following:

1. Copy all @test, @suite, @unit-tests and @mark-for-unit-test nodes (including their descendants) to the file test/dynamicUnitTest.leo.

2. Run test/leoDynamicTest.py in a separate process.

   - leoDynamicTest.py opens dynamicUnitTest.leo with the leoBridge module.
     Thus, all unit tests get run with the nullGui in effect.

   - After opening dynamicUnitTest.leo, leoDynamicTest.py runs all unit tests
     by executing the leoTest.doTests function.

   - The leoTests.doTests function searches for @test and @suite nodes and
     processes them generally as described above. The details are a bit
     different from as described, but they usually don't matter. If you *really*
     care, see the source code for leoTests.doTests.

See `Specifying settings &lt;customizing.html#specifying-settings&gt;`_ for full details of settings files.

The body text of the @enabled-plugins node contains a list of enabled plugins. Notes:

- Leo attempts to load all plugins every time an @enabled-plugins node is seen. If the plugin has already been loaded, Leo silently ignores the request to re-enable the plugin. Leo never attempts to disable a plugin while processing enabled plugin strings. Thus, plugins enabled in an @enabled-plugins node in leoSettings.leo *will* be enabled regardless of the contents of any other @enabled-plugins node.

- You can enable plugins by file name or by module name.  File names end in .py and are resolved relative to the leo/plugins directory.  Module names do *not* end in .py and are found using Python's import mechanism--the module name must be on PYTHONPATH.

- g.app.gui.getEnabledPlugins contains the last processed @enabled-plugins node.

<t tx="ekr.20070816092449">Question and answer from plumloco.

Add the equivalent of::

    import sys 
    leocore = "path/to/leo/core" 
    if leocore not in sys.path: sys.path.append(leocore) 
    import leo.core.leoBridge as leoBridge

at the head of each file that uses leoBridge.

The problem is not importing leoBridge itself but (if I use 'from leo.core') the importing of plugins, who get a different leoGlobals from leoBridge, without g.app etc, and so do not work if they rely on dynamic values in g.etc.

&gt; Why can't you simply add leo/core to sys.path in sitecustomize.py?

Putting leo/core on the python path as you suggest would put forty python modules in the global module namespace for all python programs when I want just one. Also, I have a safe working copy of leo and a cvs/testing version. I would wish to test any programs against the testing version while using the working version, but both /core directories can't be exposed at the same time.

&gt; Do you need plugins while running from the leoBridge? 

Afraid so, at least the rst3 plugin. The solution I am using now is to place::

    sys.modules['leoGlobals'] = leoGlobals  

in leoBridge after import leo.core.leoGlobals as leoGlobals

This allows my scripts to be portable over the several computers/platforms I need to use them on, and makes testing scripts against multiple leo versions easy. It does mean that my scripts are not portable to other leo users but that is not likely to be a problem.

<t tx="ekr.20071026055929.1">First, you must change Python's default encoding to something other than 'ascii'.  To do this, put the following in your sitecustomize.py file in Python's Lib folder::

    import sys 
    sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8') # 'iso-8859-1' is another choice.

You must restart Python after doing this: sys.setdefaultencoding can not be called after Python starts up.

Leo's g.es_print and g.pr functions attempts to convert incoming arguments to unicode using the default encoding. For example, the following Leo script shows various ways of printing La Peña properly::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    import sys
    e = sys.getdefaultencoding()
    print 'encoding',e
    table = (
        'La Peña',
        unicode('La Peña','utf-8'),
        u'La Peña',
        u'La Pe\\xf1a',
    )

    for s in table:
        print type(s)
        g.es_print('g.es_print',s)
        if type(s) != type(u'a'):
            s = unicode(s,e)
        print 'print     ',s

<t tx="ekr.20071210094621">This following is adapted from Terry Brown's entry in Leo's wiki.

You can not just run leoBridge from Leo, because the leoBridge module is designed to run a separate copy of Leo. However, it is possible to run leoBridge from a separate process. That turned out to be more, um, interesting than anticipated, so I'm recording the results here.

The idea is that script A running in Leo (i.e. in a regular GUI Leo session) calls script B through subprocess.Popen(), script B uses LeoBridge to do something (parse unloaded Leo files), and returns the result to script A. Passing the result back via the clipboard seemed like a possibility, but XWindows clipboard madness being what it is, that didn't seem to work.

First trick, calling script B from script A::

    import subprocess
    p = subprocess.Popen(('python',
        path_to_script_B,
        parameter_for_script_B,),
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        env={'PYTHONPATH': g.app.loadDir,'USER': g.app.leoID},
    )
    p.wait()

Setting PYTHONPATH in the environment seemed like the easiest way to let script B find leoBridge.py (which it needs to import).  But by setting the env parameter you limit script B's environment to be **only** PYTHONPATH, which causes leoBridge to fail because, in unix at least, it depends on USER in the environment.  So you need to pass that through, too.

Now, because passing stuff back on the clipboard seems unreliable, at least in XWindows, script B passes results back to script A via stdout (print), but there's some Leo initialization chatter you want to avoid.  So put a sentinel, 'START_CLIPBOARD', in the output, and collect it like this::

    response = p.stdout.readlines()
    while response and 'START_CLIPBOARD' not in response[0]:
        del response[0]
    del response[0]  # delete the sentinel as well
    response = ''.join(response)

This is the basic mechanism.  What I *actually* wanted to do was have script B generate a branch of nodes and pass that back to script A for insertion in the tree script A is running in.  That's relatively easy if you use::

    c.setCurrentPosition(pos_of_branch_to_return)
    c.copyOutline()
    print '&lt;!-- START_CLIPBOARD --&gt;'
    print g.app.gui.getTextFromClipboard()
    print '&lt;!-- END_CLIPBOARD --&gt;'

at the end of script B. Back in script A, after you've rebuilt
`response` as shown above, do::

    g.app.gui.replaceClipboardWith(response)
    c.pasteOutline()

It is easy to translate Leo's menu strings: simply create an @menus tree in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo that contains the translated menu names.

**New in Leo 4.4.8**: Leo now contains support for translating messages sent to Leo's log:

- Rather than using an '_' function to denote strings to be translated, Leo's g.es and g.es_print functions translate "odd" (first, third, fifth) arguments, leaving "even" arguments untranslated. Keyword arguments, color, newline, etc. are never translated.

- All calls to g.es and g.es_print in Leo's core follow this convention.

- g.translateString does the actual translation using Python's `gettext`_ module.

- You can use the script in the node "@button print g.es stats" in scripts.leo to create catalogs of all scripts that need to be translated. Such catalogs are used by Python's gettext module. (This script was also used to check that the proper arguments to g.es and g.es_print were translated.)

You can use several other kinds of nodes to cause Leo to ignore parts of  an @settings tree:

- @if *expression*

  A node whose headline starts with @if *expression* acts like an organizer node if the expression evaluates to True, otherwise acts like an @ignore node. If the expression is empty the body text should contain a script that will be evaluated (in an empty context).

- @ifplatform *platform-name*

  Same as @if sys.platform == "platform-name": except that it isn't necessary to import sys.

- @ifhostname *hostA,!hostB*

  Evaluates to True if and only if: h=g.computeMachineName(); h==hostA and h!=hostB. The "!" version allows matching to every machine name except the given one to allow differing settings on only a few machines.

<t tx="ekr.20080527063511.1">I had a need to figure out why a part of some python code I had written was taking too long. I pulled the code into Leo and the relevant part of the outline looked something like this::

    + Main module
    -- Generate cryptographic key
    -- Hashing algorithm

etc. So I cloned just the segment I wanted to profile and pulled it under a new section::

    + Main module
    -- [clone] Generate cryptographic key
    -- Hashing algorithm

    + Profiling Experiment
    -- [clone] Generate cryptographic key

And in the body of the "Profiling experiment", I used this code::

    code_under_here = """
    @others
    """

    from timeit import Timer
    t = Timer("print my_key_generator()", code_under_here)
    print t.timeit(number = 10)

And then I hit Control-B to execute the Profiling Experiment body. This let me make adjustments to the code in the clone body and keep hitting Control-B to execute the code with the timeit module to see immediately if what I had done was making a difference.

The great thing about this was that I just used the Leo @others construct to create a wrapper around the code and did not need to litter my code with debug or profiling statements.---Kayvan

1. First, you need to get git from http://git-scm.com/.

2. Get Leo from GitHub by doing::

        git clone https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor (http access)
    
   or::
   
        git clone git@github.com:leo-editor/leo-editor.git (ssh access)

runProfileOnNode runs the Python profiler on the script in the selected node, then reports the stats.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080730212711.52">There are several boundary cases that the update algorithm can not resolve.
For example, if a line is inserted between nodes, the algorithm can not
determine whether the line should be inserted at the end of one node or the
start of the next node. Let us call such lines **ambiguous lines**.

The algorithm *guesses* that ambiguous lines belongs at the end of a node
rather than at the start of the next node. This is usually what is
wanted--we usually insert lines at the end of a node.

Happily, **guesses don't matter**, for the following reasons:

1. The external file that results from writing the @clean x tree will be
   the same as the updated external file *no matter where* ambiguous lines
   are placed. In other words, the update algorithm is **sound**.

2. Leo reports nodes that were changed when reading any external file. The
   user can review changes to @clean and @file trees in the same way.

3. The user can permanently correct any mistaken guess. Guesses only happen
   for *newly inserted or changed* lines. Moving an ambiguous line to the
   following node will not change the external file. As a result, the
   next time Leo reads the file the line will be placed in the correct node!

This proves that @shadow and @clean are easy and safe to use. The
remaining sections of this document discuss code-level details.

The sax parser complains that these characters are not valid in .xml files. Remove these invalid characters as follows:

1. `run Leo in a console`_, and load the .leo file. Near the bottom of the error message you will see a line like::

    SAXParseException: &lt;unknown&gt;:123:25: not well-formed (invalid token)

This line reports a bad character at character 25 of line 123.

2. Open the .leo file in an external editor. The Scite editor, http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html, is a good choice because it clearly shows non-printing characters. Remove the invalid character, save the .leo file.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all invalid characters are gone.

<t tx="ekr.20080922124033.1">k.get1Arg handles the next character the user types when accumulating a user argument from the minibuffer.  k.get1Arg handles details such as tab completion, backspacing, Ctrl-G etc.

Commands should use k.get1Arg to get the first minibuffer argument and k.getNextArg to get all other arguments.

k.get1Arg is a state machine. It has to be because it's almost always waiting for the user to type the next character. The handle keyword arg specifies the next state in the machine.

The following examples will work in any class having a 'c' ivar bound to a commander.
   
Example 1: get one argument from the user::
   
    @cmd('my-command')
    def myCommand(self, event):
        """State 0"""
        k = self.c.k
        k.setLabelBlue('prompt: ')
        k.get1Arg(event, handler=self.myCommand1)
           
    def myCommand1(self, event):
        """State 1"""
        k = self.c.k
        # ----&gt; k.arg contains the argument.
        # Finish the command.
        ...
        # Reset the minibuffer.
        k.clearState()
        k.resetLabel()
        k.showStateAndMode()
       
Example 2: get two arguments from the user::
   
    @cmd('my-command')
    def myCommand(self, event):
        """State 0"""
        k = self.c.k
        k.setLabelBlue('first prompt: ')
        k.get1Arg(event, handler=self.myCommand1)
           
    def myCommand1(self, event):
        """State 1"""
        k = self.c.k
        self.arg1 = k.arg
        k.setLabelBlue('second prompt: ')
        k.getNextArg(handler=self.myCommand2)
       
    def myCommand2(self, event):
        """State 2"""
        k = self.c.k
        # -----&gt; k.arg contains second argument.
        # Finish the command, using self.arg1 and k.arg.
        ...
        # Reset the minibuffer.
        k.clearState()
        k.resetLabel()
        k.showStateAndMode()

**Summary**

- The handler keyword argument to k.get1Arg and k.getNextArg specifies the next state in the state machine.

- k.get1Arg contains many optional keyword arguments. See its docstring for details.

In particular, d.get('path') returns the full, absolute path created by all @path directives that are in ancestors of node p. If p is any kind of @file node (including @file, @auto, @clean, etc.), the following script will print the full path to the created file::

<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.10">\@menuat modifies the menu tree created by @menus. This allows settings in myLeoSettings.leo to change menus without copying the entire menu tree from leoSettings.leo. This ensures you don’t miss out when new things are added in the @menus in leoSettings.leo, as you would if you replaced the @menus in leoSettings.leo with one in myLeoSettings.leo.

\@menuat should occur in a @settings tree, but not as a descendant of a @menus tree. Its children are @menu and @item nodes as for the @menu setting.

The @menuat setting has 2-3 parameters in its head text]::

    @menuat *&lt;path&gt;* *&lt;action&gt;* *[clipboard]*

The path argument specifies a **target** in the menu tree as defined by @menus and modified by earlier @menuat settings. The path takes the form::

    /entry1/entry2/entry3
    
Each entry is the **cleaned** name of a menu or item. Cleaned names are a name with all text except a-z and 0-9 removed and upper case letters converted to lower case. For example, specify::

    Outline-&gt;Move-&gt;Move Down
    
as::
    
     /outline/move/movedown

The action argument specifies what the menu item does. There are 5 available actions:

- **before**: Insert items and sub menus immediately before the target.
- **after**:  Insert items and sub menus immediately after the target.
- **append**: Append items and sub menus at the end of the target menu or item.
- **cut**:    Remove the target from the menu tree and save it to an internal clipboard.
- **copy**:   Copy the target to an internal clipboard. Descendants of the @menuat setting are ignored.

The cut and copy arguments ignore descendants of the @menuat setting .

The optional clipboard argument modifies the action of the before, after, and append actions. By default these actions insert the menus and items supplied as descendants of the @menuat setting. If you specify “clipboard” (without the quotes) as the source, the contents of the clipboard from a previous cut or copy action will be used instead.

You can specify modes with @mode nodes in leoSettings.leo. @mode nodes work just like @shortcuts nodes, but in addition they have the side effect of creating the enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode command.

The form of this node is::

    @mode *&lt;mode name&gt;*

The body text contains a list of shortcut specifiers. @mode nodes work just like @shortcuts nodes, but in addition they have the side effect of creating the enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode command.

Notes:

- You can exit any mode using the keyboard-quit (Control-g) command. This is the **only** binding that is automatically created in each mode. All other bindings must be specified in the @mode node. In particular, the bindings specified in @shortcuts nodes are **not** in effect in mode (again, except for the keyboard-quit binding).

- Leo supports something akin to tab completion within modes: if you type a key that isn't bound in a mode a 'Mode' tab will appear in the log pane. This tab shows all the keys that you can type and the commands to which they are bound. The mode-help command does the same thing.

- @shortcuts nodes specify the bindings for what might be called the 'top-level' mode. These are the bindings in effect when no internal state is present, for example, just after executing the keyboard-quit command.

- The top_level_unbound_key_action setting determines what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode. Leo ignores unbound keys in all other modes. The possibilities are 'insert', 'replace' and 'ignore'.

- The set-insert-mode, set-overwrite-mode and set-ignore-mode commands alter what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode.
  
- If the @mode headline contains ::, everything following the :: is the mode prompt. For example::
    
    @mode abc :: xyz
    
Creates the enter-abc-mode command, but the prompt for the command is xyz.

With all these options it should be possible to emulate the keyboard behavior of any other editor.

<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.2">When reading a .leo file, Leo looks for settings in default settings files first, then settings in personal settings files, and finally settings in local settings files.  The exact search order is:

1. Default settings files:

   a. configDir/leoSettings.leo
   b. homeDir/leoSettings.leo
   c. localDir/leoSettings.leo

2. Personal settings files:

   a. configDir/myLeoSettings.leo
   b. homeDir/myLeoSettings.leo
   c. homeDir/&lt;machine-name&gt;LeoSettings.leo (note capitalization)
   d. localDir/myLeoSettings.leo

3. Local settings files: the file being loaded.

Settings that appear later in this list override settings that appear earlier in this list.  This happens on a setting-by-setting basis, *not* on a file-by-file basis.  In other words, each individual setting overrides only the *corresponding* setting in previously-read files.  Reading a setting file does *not* reset all previous settings. Note that the same file might appear several times in the search list. Leo detects such duplicate file names and only loads each settings file once. Leo remembers all the settings in settings files and does not reread those settings when reading another .leo file.

**Caution**: This search order offers almost too much flexibility. This can be confusing, even for power users. It's important to choose the "simplest configuration scheme that could possibly work".  Something like:

- Use a single leoSettings.leo file for installation-wide defaults.
- Use a single myLeoSettings.leo files for personal defaults.
- Use local settings sparingly.

**Important**: it is good style to limit settings placed in myLeoSettings.leo to those settings that differ from default settings.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.3">You should use special care when placing default or personal settings files in **local** directories, that is, directories other than homeDir, configDir or machineDir. In particular, the value of localDir can change when Leo reads additional files. This can result in Leo finding new default and personal settings files. The values of these newly-read settings files will, as always, override any previously-read settings.

Let us say that a setting is **volatile** if it is different from a default setting. Let us say that settings file A.leo **covers** settings file if B.leo if all volatile settings in B.leo occur in A.leo. With these definitions, the **safe rule** for placing settings files in local directories is::

   Settings files in local directories should
   cover all other settings files.

Following this rule will ensure that the per-directory defaults specified in the local settings file will take precedence over all previously-read default and personal settings files. Ignore this principle at your peril.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.5">An @buttons tree in a settings file defines global buttons that are created in the icon area of all .leo files. All @button nodes in the @commands tree create global buttons. All @button nodes outside the commands tree create buttons local to the settings file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.6">An @commands tree in a settings file defines global commands. All @command nodes in the @commands tree create global commands. All @command nodes outside the commands tree create commands local to the settings file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.7">The body text contains a list of strings, one per line. Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.8" str_atime="1376412853.0">The body text of the @enabled plugins node contains a list of enabled plugins, one per line. Comment lines starting with '#' are ignored. Leo loads plugins in the order they appear. **Important**: Leo handles @enabled-plugins nodes a differently from other kinds of settings. To avoid confusion, **please read the following carefully**.

As always, Leo looks for @enabled-plugins nodes in settings files in the order specified by `Search order for settings files`_. Leo will enable all plugins found in the @enabled-plugins node it finds *last* in the search order. Leo does *not* enable plugins found in any other @enabled-plugins node. In particular, **you can not specify a list of default plugins by placing that list in a settings file that appears early in the search list**. Instead, the last @enabled-plugins node found in the search list specifies all and *only* the plugins that will be enabled.

Let us distinguish two different situations. First, what Leo does when loading a file, say x.leo. Second, what Leo does when loading a second file, say y.leo, *from x.leo*. When loading the first .leo file, Leo enables plugins from the
@enabled-plugins node it finds *last* in the search order. But after plugins
have *already* been loaded and enabled, there is no way to disable previously
loaded-and-enabled plugins. But local settings files can enable additional
plugins.

To avoid confusion, I highly recommend following another kind of safe rule. We say that an @enabled-plugin node in file A.leo **covers** an @enabled-plugin node in file B.leo if all plugins specified in B's @enabled-plugin node appear A's @enabled-plugin node. The safe rule for plugins is::

  @enabled-plugin nodes in settings files in local directories
  should cover @enabled-plugins nodes in all other settings files.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.9">Leo creates its menus from the @menu, @item and @popup nodes in the @menus tree. Within @menus trees, @menu nodes create menus and @item nodes create menu items.

The menu name always follows @menu. If the menu name is 'Plugins', Leo will create the Plugins menu and populate the menu by calling the 'create-optional-menus' hook. This creates the Plugins menu as usual. Nested @menu nodes define submenus.

The command name follows @item. If the body text of an @item node exists, this body text is the menu name. Otherwise, the menu name is the command name. However, if the command name starts with a '*', hyphens are removed from the menu name. Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&amp;). If present, the following character is underlined in the name. If the command name in an @item node is just a hyphen (-), the item represents a menu separator.

\@popup *&lt;widget-name&gt;* creates a popup menu for use by the contextmenu.py plugin. The children of this node should be @menu and @item nodes, used as with @menus.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116130002.1">Settings files can be found in the following directories:

- **homeDir**, the HOME/.leo directory. HOME is given by Python's HOME environment variable, or by os.expanduser('~') if no HOME environment variable exists.

- **configDir**, Leo's configuration directory: leo/config.

- **machineDir**, the HOME/.leo/MACHINE directory. MACHINE is given by Python's HOSTNAME environment variable, or by Python's COMPUTERNAME environment variable if there is no HOSTNAME variable, or by the value returned by socket.gethostname() if neither environment variable exists.

- **localDir**, the directory containing the .leo file being loaded.

Note that rst3odt.py is in the tools directory of the DocUtils distribution.

To generate .rtf, you can use PanDoc to convert test.html.txt to RTF.

To generate .pdf files, you would first convert test.html.txt to LaTeX::

    python rst2newlatex.py test.html.txt test.tex

    -- OR --

<t tx="ekr.20100122073254.11655">This section describes the process of creating an importer for a new language. There are a set of "importers" in leoImport.py, all based on the baseScannerClass class. You can define your own importer by creating a subclass. This shouldn't be too difficult: baseScannerClass is supposed to do almost all the work. With luck, your subclass might be very simple, as with class cScanner.

**Important** As I write this, I realize that I remember very little about the code, but I do remember its general organization and the process of creating a new importer. The following should be all you need to write any importer.

This base class has three main parts:

1. The "parser" that recognizes where nodes begin and end.

2. The "code generator" the actually creates the imported nodes.

3. Checking code that ensures that the imported code is equivalent to the original code.

You should never have to change the code generators or the checking code. Confine your attention to the parser.

The parser thinks it is looking for classes, and within classes, method definitions.  Your job is to tell the parser how to do this. Let's look at part of the ctor for baseScannerClass for clues::

   # May be overridden in subclasses.
   self.anonymousClasses = [] # For Delphi Pascal interfaces.
   self.blockCommentDelim1 = None
   self.blockCommentDelim2 = None
   self.blockCommentDelim1_2 = None
   self.blockCommentDelim2_2 = None
   self.blockDelim1 = '{'
   self.blockDelim2 = '}'
   self.blockDelim2Cruft = [] # Stuff that can follow .blockDelim2.
   self.classTags = ['class',] # tags that start a tag.
   self.functionTags = []
   self.hasClasses = True
   self.hasFunctions = True
   self.lineCommentDelim = None
   self.lineCommentDelim2 = None
   self.outerBlockDelim1 = None
   self.outerBlockDelim2 = None
   self.outerBlockEndsDecls = True
   self.sigHeadExtraTokens = [] # Extra tokens valid in head of signature.
   self.sigFailTokens = []
       # A list of strings that abort a signature when seen in a tail.
       # For example, ';' and '=' in C.
   self.strict = False # True if leading whitespace is very significant.

Yes, this looks like gibberish. I do *not* remember what all these things do in detail, although obviously the names mean something. What I *do* remember is that these ivars control the operation of the startsFunction and startsClass methods and their helpers (especially startsHelper) and the methods that call them, scan and scanHelper. Most of these methods have a trace var that will enable tracing during importing.

So the strategy is simple: study startsHelper in detail, set the ivars above to make startsHelper do what you want, and trace until things work as you want.

There is one more detail. Sometimes the ivars above are not sufficient to get the job done. In that case, subclasses will override various methods of the parser, but *not* the code generator. If indentation is important, you will want to look at the Python importer. Notice that it overrides skipCodeBlock, called by startsHelper.

That's about it. It would be pointless to give you more details, because those details would lead you *away* from the process you need to follow. Having said that, feel free to ask further questions. I'll be glad to answer them.

<t tx="ekr.20100506062734.11593">The mod_scripting plugin runs @scripts before plugin initiation is complete. Thus, such scripts can not directly modify plugins. Instead, a script can create an event handler for the after-create-leo-frame that will modify the plugin.

For example, the following modifies the cleo.py plugin after Leo has completed loading it::

    def prikey(self, v):
        try:
            pa = int(self.getat(v, 'priority'))
        except ValueError:
            pa = -1

        if pa == 24:
            pa = -1
        if pa == 10:
            pa = -2

        return pa

    import types
    from leo.core import leoPlugins

    def on_create(tag, keywords):
        c.cleo.prikey = types.MethodType(prikey, c.cleo, c.cleo.__class__)

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("after-create-leo-frame",on_create)

Attempting to modify c.cleo.prikey immediately in the @script gives an AttributeError as c has no .cleo when the @script is executed. Deferring it by using registerHandler() avoids the problem.

Escape convention

    A convention for representing sequences of characters that would otherwise
    have special meaning. **Important**: Leo does not support escape conventions
    used by `noweb`_. Any line containing matched &lt;\&lt; and &gt;\&gt; is a section
    reference, regardless of context. To use &lt;\&lt; and &gt;\&gt; as ordinary characters,

    pair: Dehoist; Glossary

Hoist &amp; dehoist

    Hoisting a node redraws the screen that node and its descendants becomes the
    only visible part of the outline. Leo prevents the you from moving nodes
    outside the hoisted outline. Dehoisting a node restores the outline.
    Multiple hoists may be in effect: each dehoist undoes the effect of the
    immediately preceding hoist.

.. index::

    pair: Organizer node; Glossary

Organizer node

    A node containing no body text. Organizing nodes may appear anywhere in an
    @file tree; they do not affect the external file in any way. In particular,
    organizing nodes do not affect indentation in external files.

.. index::
    pair: Orphan node; Glossary

Orphan node

    A node that would not be copied to a external file. Orphan nodes can arise
    because an @file tree has no @others or @all directives. Sections that are
    defined but not used also create orphan nodes.

    Leo issues a warning when attempting to write an @file tree containing
    orphan nodes, and does not save the external file. No information is lost;
    Leo saves the information in the @file tree in the .leo file. Leo will load
    the @file tree from the .leo file the next time Leo opens the .leo file.

Reference .leo file

Leo's `git repository`_ and Leo distributions contain the following reference files: LeoPyRef.leo, LeoPluginsRef.leo and leoGuiPluginsRef.leo. These reference files should contain nothing but @file nodes and should change only when new external files get added to the project. Developers should use *local copies* of reference files for their own work. For example, instead of using LeoPyRef.leo directly, I use a copy called LeoPy.leo.

    pair: Sentinel Lines; Glossary

Sentinel

    Comment lines in external files used to represent Leo's outline structure.
    Such lines start with an @ following the opening comment delimiter.
    Sentinels embed outline structure into external files.

    **Do not alter sentinel lines**. Doing so can corrupt the outline structure.

.. index::
    pair: Setting; Glossary

Settings:

    Plugins and other parts of Leo can get options from @settings trees,
    outlines whose headline is @settings. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks
    for @settings trees in the outline being opened and also in various
    leoSettings.leo files. @settings trees allow plugins to get options without
    any further support from Leo's core code. For a full discussion of @settings
    trees, see `Customizing Leo`_.

Underindent line

    A line of body text that is indented less then the starting line of the
    class, method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not
    represent such lines exactly: every line in an external file will have at
    least the indentation of any unindented line of the corresponding node in
    the outline.

This section is a reference guide for all other Leo directives, organized alphabetically.

Unless otherwise noted, all directives listed are valid only in body text, and they must start at the leftmost column of the node.

.. glossary::
     :sorted:

.. index::
    pair: @; Reference
.. index::
    pair: @doc; Reference
.. index::
    pair: Doc part; Reference

\@ and \@doc

    These directives start a doc part. @doc is a synonym for @. Doc parts
    continue until an @c directive or the end of the body text. For example::

        @ This is a comment in a doc part.
        Doc parts can span multiple lines.
        The next line ends the doc part
        @c

    When writing external files, Leo writes doc parts as comments.

    Leo does not recognize @ or @doc in @asis trees or when the @all or
    @delims directives are in effect.

.. index::
    pair: @c; Reference
.. index::
    pair: @code; Reference

\@c and @code

    Ends any doc part and starts a code part.

    \@code is a deprecated synonym for @c.

    Leo does not recognize this directive in @asis trees or when the
    @all or @raw directives are in effect.

.. index::
    pair: @chapter; Reference
    
.. _`Using Chapters`: commands.html#using-chapters

\@chapter

    An @chapter tree represents a chapter. For full details, see `Using Chapters`_.

    These directives must appear in the node's headline.

.. index::
    pair: @encoding; Reference

\@encoding &lt;encoding&gt;

    Specifies the Unicode encoding for an external file. For example::

        @encoding iso-8859-1

    When reading external files, the encoding given must match the encoding
    actually used in the external file or "byte hash" will result.

.. index::
    pair: @first; Reference

\@first &lt;text&gt;

    Places lines at the very start of an external file, before any Leo
    sentinels. @first lines must be the *very first* lines in an @&lt;file&gt; node.
    More then one @first lines may appear.

    This creates two first lines, a shebang line and a Python encoding line::

        @first #! /usr/bin/env python
        @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    Here is a perl example::

        @first #!/bin/sh -- # perl, to stop looping
        @first eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -w -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
        @first     if 0;

\@ignore

    Tells Leo to ignore the subtree in which it appears.

    In the body text of most top-level @&lt;file&gt; nodes, the @ignore directive
    causes Leo not to write the tree. However, Leo ignores @ignore directives
    in @asis trees.

    Plugins and other parts of Leo sometimes @ignore for their own purposes. For
    example, Leo's unit testing commands will ignore trees containing @ignore.
    In such cases, the @ignore directive may appear in the headline or body
    text.

.. index::
    pair: @language; Reference
    
..  # A script to generate the list of languages
..  import glob
..  dir_ = g.os_path_finalize_join(g.app.loadDir, '..', 'modes')
..  aList = sorted(glob.glob('%s/*.py' % dir_))
..  s = ', '.join([g.shortFileName(z)[: -3] for z in aList])
..  g.es(s)

\@language &lt;language name&gt;

    Specifies the language in effect, including comment delimiters.
    If no @language directive is in effect, Leo uses the defaults specified
    by the @string target-language setting.

    A node may contain multiple @language directives.

    The valid language names include the following: actionscript, ada95, ahk, antlr, apacheconf, apdl, applescript, asp, aspect_j, assembly_macro32, assembly_mcs51, assembly_parrot, assembly_r2000, assembly_x86, awk, b, batch, bbj, bcel, bibtex, c, chill, clojure, cobol, coldfusion, cplusplus, csharp, css, cython, d, dart, doxygen, eiffel, embperl, erlang, factor, forth, fortran, fortran90, foxpro, gettext, groovy, haskell, haxe, html, i4gl, icon, idl, inform, ini, inno_setup, interlist, io, java, javascript, jhtml, jmk, jsp, kivy, latex, lilypond, lisp, lotos, lua, mail, makefile, maple, matlab, md, ml, modula3, moin, mqsc, netrexx, nqc, nsi, nsis2, objective_c, objectrexx, occam, omnimark, pascal, patch, perl, php, phpsection, pike, pl1, plain, plsql, pop11, postscript, povray, powerdynamo, prolog, pseudoplain, psp, ptl, pvwave, pyrex, python, r, rebol, redcode, rest, rhtml, rib, rpmspec, rtf, ruby, rview, sas, scala, scheme, sdl_pr, sgml, shell, shellscript, shtml, smalltalk, smi_mib, splus, sqr, squidconf, ssharp, swig, tcl, tex, texinfo, text, tpl, tsql, uscript, vbscript, velocity, verilog, vhdl, xml, xsl, yaml, zpt.

    **Note**: Shell files have comments that start with #.

    Case is ignored in the language names. For example, the following are
    equivalent::

        @language html
        @language HTML

    The @language directive also controls syntax coloring. For language x, the
    file leo/modes/x.py describes how to colorize the language. To see the
    languages presently supported, look in the leo/modes directory. There are
    over 100 such languages.

.. index::
    pair: @last; Reference

\@last &lt;text&gt;

    Places lines at the very end of external files.

    This directive must occur at the *very end* of top-level @&lt;file&gt; nodes. More
    than one @last directive may exist. For example::

        @first &lt;?php
        ...
        @last ?&gt;

    Leo does not recognize @last directive in @asis trees.

.. index::
    pair: @lineending; Reference

\@lineending cr/lf/nl/crlf

    Sets the line endings for external files.
    This directive overrides the @string output_newline setting.

    The valid forms of the @lineending directive are:

    ========================   ======================================================
    \@lineending nl            The default, Linux.

    \@lineending lf            Same as 'nl', not recommended
    ------------------------   ------------------------------------------------------
    \@lineending platform      Same as platform value for output_newline setting.
    ========================   ======================================================

.. index::
    pair: @nowrap; Reference

\@nowrap

    Disables line wrapping the Leo's body pane.

    Only the first @wrap or @nowrap directive in a node has any effect.

    @nowrap may appear in either headlines or body text.

.. index::
    pair: @pagewidth; Reference

\@pagewidth &lt;n&gt;

   Sets the page width used to break doc parts into lines.
   &lt;n&gt; should be a positive integer.  For example::

      @pagewidth 100

  The @pagewidth directive overrides the @int page_width setting.

.. index::
    pair: @path; Reference
.. index::
    pair: Absolute path; Reference
.. index::
    pair: Path prefix; Reference

\@path &lt;path&gt;

   Sets the **path prefix** for relative filenames for all @&lt;file&gt; tree.

   This directive may appear in headlines or body text, and may
   appear in top-level @&lt;file&gt; nodes.

   The path is an **absolute path** if it begins with c:\\ or /,
   otherwise the path is a **relative** paths.

   Multiple @path directives may contribute to the path prefix.
   Absolute paths overrides any ancestor @path directives.
   Relative paths add to the path prefix.

   If no @path directives are in effect, the default path prefix is
   the directory containing the .leo file.
   
.. index::
    pair: @persistence; Reference
    
\@persistence
    
With @clean and @file, Leo can store **persistent data** in nodes. This information consists of the node's **gnx** (Global Node Index) and the node's **uA**, (User Attributes). The gnx gives each node a unique, immutable identity. Gnx's make clones possible. The uA allows scripts and plugins to associate arbitrarily much additional data with each node.

By default, Leo's importers preserve neither gnx's nor uA's. This makes imported @auto trees second class citizens. To remedy this, if an outline contains an @persistence node, Leo will save data in the @persistence tree that allows Leo to recover gnx's and uA's when re-reading @auto files later. This allows clone links and uA's to persist.

@persistence is an optional feature. The stored data is akin to bookmarks. The data can "break" (become inaccessible) if the structure (including class/method/function names) changes. However, the data will typically break infrequently. To disable this feature, just delete an existing @persistence node or change @persistence to @@persistence.

    pair: @&lt;file&gt;; Reference

This section discusses the @&lt;file&gt; directives. These directives create or import external files.

\@&lt;file&gt; nodes create external files::

    @asis &lt;filename&gt;        write only, no sentinels, exact line endings
    @auto &lt;filename&gt;        recommended
    @clean &lt;filename&gt;       recommended
    @edit &lt;filename&gt;        @edit node contains entire file
    @file &lt;filename&gt;        recommended
    @nosent &lt;filename&gt;      write only, no sentinels

**Note**: @file, @clean and @auto are the recommended ways of creating external files. @asis and @nosent are for special occasions.

**Note**: All these directive must appear in headlines.

The following table compares the various ways of creating external files. Later sections provide more details::

                             Sections &amp;   File data in
    @&lt;file&gt; kind  Sentinels?  @others?    .leo file?    Notes

**Note 1**: @auto nodes read files using language-specific importers.
By default, the file's extension determines the importer::

**Important**: The importers/exporters for markdown, org-mode, reStructuredText and vimoutline files automatically generate section heading of the appropriate level. Body text of the top-level @auto node is ignored.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4393">.. index::
    pair: @asis; Reference

The @asis directive creates an external file without sentinels and without any expansions.

Use this directive only when you must have complete control over every character of the external file. When writing @asis nodes, writes the body text of all nodes in outline order. Leo writes the body text *as is*, without recognizing section definitions, without expanding section references, and without treating directives specially in any way. In particular, Leo copies all directives, including @ or @c directives, to the external file as text.

.. index::
    pair: @@ convention in @asis trees; Reference

**The @@ convention**: Within @asis trees only, if a headline starts with @@, Leo writes everything in the headline following the @@ just before the corresponding body text.

Files created from @asis trees contain *nothing* not contained in body text (or
@@ headlines). In particular, if body text does not end in a newline, the first
line from the next node will concatenated to the last line of the preceding node.

Within @asis trees, Leo writes no sentinels to the external file, so Leo can not update the outline using changes to the external file. When reading .leo files, Leo does *not* read external files created from @asis nodes. Instead, all data in an @asis tree is stored in the .leo file.

Within @asis trees, Leo recognizes the @ignore directive only in the *ancestors* of @asis nodes. This allows you to use the @ignore directive to prevent Leo from writing @asis trees.

**Note**: @file-asis and @silent are deprecated synonyms for @asis.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4395">.. index::
    pair: @edit; Reference

The @edit directive imports an external file into a single node.

When reading @edit nodes, Leo reads the entire file into the @edit node. Lines
that look like sentinels will be read just as they are.

When writing @edit nodes, @edit nodes must not have children and section
references and @others are not allowed.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4396">.. index::
    pair: @auto; Reference

The @auto directive imports an external file into a tree of nodes.

@auto trees allow people to use Leo in collaborative environments without using sentinels in external files. Even without sentinels, @auto trees can change when the corresponding external file changes outside of Leo.

.. index::
    pair: Importer; Reference

\@auto nodes read files using language-specific importers.
By default, the file's extension determines the importer::

.. index::
    pair: @clean; Reference

The @clean &lt;filename&gt; creates an external file without sentinel lines.
@clean trees will probably be the most convenient way of creating and
accessing external files for most people.

When writing an @clean tree, Leo expands section references, @all and
@others directives, but Leo writes no sentinels to the external file.


When reading an @clean tree, Leo propagates changes from the external file
to the @clean tree using the `Mulder/Ream update algorithm`_.

**Note**: The @bool force_newlines_in_at_nosent_bodies setting controls whether
Leo writes a trailing newline if non-empty body text does not end in a newline.
The default is True.

**Important**: As of Leo 5.1, @shadow is **deprecated** Use @clean instead. @clean is faster than @shadow and requires no hidden files.

The @shadow directive creates *two* external files, a **public** file without sentinels, and a **private** file containing sentinels.

.. _`Mulder/Ream update algorithm`: appendices.html#the-mulder-ream-update-algorithm

When reading an @shadow node, Leo uses the `Mulder/Ream update algorithm`_ to compare the public and private files, then updates the outline based on changes to the *public* file.

Leo can do an initial import of @shadow trees by parsing the corresponding public file, exactly as is done for @auto nodes.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4403">.. index::
    pair: @file; Reference
    pair: @thin; Reference

The @file directive creates an external file containing sentinels. When writing
@file trees, Leo expands section references and @all and @others directives.

When reading external files created by @file, the sentinels allow Leo to
recreate all aspects of the outline. In particular, Leo can update the
outline based on changes made to the file by another editor. 

**Important**: @file is the recommended way to create and edit most
files. In particular, using @file nodes is **highly recommended**
when sharing external files in a collaborative environment. The @all
directivive is designed for "catch-all" files, like todo.txt or
notes.txt or whatever. Such files are assumed to contain a random
collection of nodes, so there is no language in effect and no real
comment delimiters.

The @thin directive is a synonym for @file.

Prior to Leo 4.7, @file worked differently from @thin. This should not be
a problem: Leo 4.7 can read all external files written by Leo 4.6.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100806170836.4408">These directives alter how Leo represents data in external files. They are **dangerous**--mistakes in using these sentinels can make it impossible for Leo to read the resulting external file. Use them with care!

Nevertheless, these sentinels can be useful in special situations.

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

.. index::
    pair: @comment; Reference

\@comment &lt;1, 2 or three comment delims&gt;

    Sets the comment delimiters in @file and @shadow files.
    **Important**: Use @comment for unusual situations only. In most cases, you
    should use the @language directive to set comment delimiters.

    The @comment directive may be followed by one, two or three delimiters,
    separated by whitespace. If one delimiter is given, it sets the delimiter
    used by single-line comments. If two delimiters are given, they set the
    block comment delimiter. If three delimiters are given, the first sets the
    single-line-comment delimiter, and the others set the block-comment
    delimiters.

    Within these delimiters, underscores represent a significant space, and
    double underscores represent a newline. Examples::

        @comment REM_
        @comment __=pod__ __=cut__

    The second line sets PerlPod comment delimiters.

    **Warning**: the @comment and @delims directives **must not** appear in
    the same node. Doing so may create a file that Leo can not read.

    **Note**: @language and @comment may appear in the same node, provided
    that @comment appears *after* the @language directive: @comment overrides
    @language.

    The @comment directive must precede the first section name or @c
    directive.
    
    There are situations where using @delims or @comment is not avoidable or impractical to
    add new language definition, and including it causes the resulting file to be invalid.
    In place of delimiter definition, use @0x + delimiter encoded in hexadecimal.
    The hexadecimal part must be acceptable input to binascii.unhexlify(), otherwise whole 
    directive will be ignored. Use binascii.hexlify('my-delimiter') to generate it.
    Decoded delimiters are not checked for validity (such as, UTF-8) and whether they 
    do not clash with Leo format (like newline or NUL characters)!
    
    Example::
    
        @comment @0x3c212d2d2120 @0x202d2d3e
    
    for GenshiXML is the same definition as 
        
        @comment &lt;!--!_ _--&gt;
    
    to create comments that will be removed from the output by Genshi. But the latter would 
    cause XML parsing error on the @comment line.
    
.. index::
    pair: @delims; Reference

\@delims &lt;1 or 2 comment delims&gt;

    Sets comment delimiters in external files containing sentinel lines.

    The @delims directive requires one or two delimiters, separated by
    whitespace. If one delimiter is present it sets the single-line-comment
    delimiter. If two delimiters are present they set block comment delimiters.

    This directive is often used to place Javascript text inside XML or HTML
    files. Like this::

        @delims /* */
        Javascript stuff
        @delims &lt;-- --&gt;
        HTML stuff

    **Warning**: you **must** change back to previous delimiters using another
    @delims directive. Failure to change back to the previous delimiters will
    thoroughly corrupt the external file as far as compilers, HTML renderers,
    etc. are concerned. Leo does not do this automatically at the end of a node.

    **Warning**: the @comment and @delims directives **must not** appear in
    the same node. Doing so may create a file that Leo can not read.

    **Note**: The @delims directive can not be used to change the comment
    strings at the start of the external file, that is, the comment strings for
    the @+leo sentinel and the initial @+body and @+node sentinels.

.. index::

\@raw and \@end_raw

    \@raw starts a section of "raw" text that ends *only* with the @end_raw directive
    or the end of the body text containing the @raw directive. Within this
    range, Leo ignores all section references and directives, and Leo generates
    no additional leading whitespace.

\@all

    Copies *all* descendant nodes to the external file. Use @all to place
    unrelated data in an external file.

    The @all directive is valid only in the body of @file trees.

    Within the range of an @all directive, Leo ignores the @others directive
    and section references, so Leo will not complain about orphan nodes.
    
    The @all directivive is designed for "catch-all" files, like
    todo.txt or notes.txt or whatever. Such files are assumed to
    contain a random collection of nodes, so there is no language in

``show_headlines (default: True)``
    **True**: automatically generate rST sections from headlines. **False**: ignore headlines.
    
    **Note**: The level of the node in the outline determines the level of the section underlining in the rST markup. Higher-level headlines in the outline correspond to higher-level section headings; lower-level headlines in the outline correspond to lower-level section headings.

``show_organizer_nodes (default: True)``
    **True**: generate rST sections for nodes that do not contain body text. *This option has no effect unless the rST section would otherwise be written*.

``show_sections (default: True)``
    **True**: generate rST sections corresponding to headlines. **False**: Generate lines of the form ``headline`` instead of sections.
    
``silent (default: False)``
    Write only the number of files written and the time taken to the log and console.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100810091118.4306">The following option has effect only in rst mode.

.. glossary::

``show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode [True,False or class names] (default: True)``
    This option is most useful for rst documents which are not computer code. It allows you to use doc parts to make comments on the draft document which are either excluded from the output or formatted in a way that highlights their nature as comments rather than content. For example, you're writing a book, and you want to use a doc part at the top of a section to remind yourself "need to explain how Ted got to Sally's". Note: you may need to add CSS to have them formatted differently.

    The option can be `True`, `False`, or one or more class names.
    
    **True**: Treat the entire doc part from the opening '@' to the closing '@c
    as normal markup.
    
    **False**: Remove the doc part.

    **class names**: Process the contents of the doc part as it if were in an rst `container` directive. For example::

         @ @rst-options
         show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode = notes literal
         @c

This would wrap the doc part contents in the output in a div with classes "container notes literal". Furthermore, if one of the class names is ``literal``, then the doc part content will be output as a literal block wrapped in a container as described above. This allows you to use text which is not valid rst as rough notes for annotating a draft document.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20100810203016.4298">The rst3 command supports three different modes.

``rst mode``
    The default mode, as discussed in the Tutorial. The rst3 command treats body text as rST (or Sphinx) markup.
    
``code mode``
    The rst3 command treats body text as computer source code, generating the appropriate rST or Sphinx markup. Code mode is inherently complex. It supports *many* options.
    
``doc-only mode``
    The rst3 command outputs only regular doc parts and @ @rst-markup doc parts. Headlines create section in doc_only mode only if:

1. The node contains a doc part or

2. The show_organizer_nodes option is in effect.

The code_mode and doc_only_mode options determine the mode as follows:

``code_mode=False; doc_only_mode=False (the default)``
    Enters rst mode.
    
``code_mode=False; doc_only_mode=True``
    Enters doc_only mode.

``code_mode=True; (doc_only_mode ignored)``
    Enters code mode.

Formerly, this had to be on because the expansion bits
of @screenshot trees were significant.

Happily, this is no longer true.

True (recommended):
    Write "E" attribute bits in &lt;v&gt; elements.
    Leo outlines will record the expansion state of all nodes.

False:
    (Good for files like unitTest.leo)
    Suppress "E" attribute bits in &lt;v&gt; elements.
    Only the ancestors of the presently selected node will
    be expanded when Leo opens an outline.

<t tx="ekr.20101025080245.6085">Leo 4.5 final was released September 2, 2008. Leo's drawing and focus code was substantially simplified, removing all calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate.

::

    Full support for @shadow files in Leo's core
    Major improvements to Leo's key binding code &amp; usable vim-like bindings
    uA's may now be associated with vnodes in @thin and @shadow files
    Leo now always uses sax to read .leo files
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101025080245.6086">Leo 4.6 final was released July 15, 2009.  The big feature was caching of external files, a feature suggested by Ville M. Vainio.  Caching *greatly* reduces the time to load .leo files.

::

    Leo used Qt interface by default.
    Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them
    Added @auto-rst and @edit
    Added Properties of commanders, positions and vnodes
    Leo warns on dangerous writes to @thin and @file nodes
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101025080245.6087">Leo 4.7 final was released February 23, 2010. Leo 4.7.1 final fixed a serious bug in Leo 4.7.  It went out the door just days later, on February 26, 2010.

Leo 4.7 accomplishes something I long thought to be impossible: the unification of vnodes and tnodes. tnodes no longer exist: vnodes contain all data. The Aha that made this possible is that iterators and positions allow a single node to appear in more than one place in a tree traversal.

This was one of the most significant developments in Leo's history. At last the endless confusion between vnodes and tnodes is gone. At the most fundamental level, Leo's data structures are as simple as possible. This makes them as general and as powerful as possible!

::

    A single code base runs on both Python 2 and 3
    Automatically converts from old-style to new-style sentinels
    Added a new Windows installer

Leo 4.7.1 fixed dangerous bug in Leo 4.7. The problem arose because it was too easy to save the .leo file (thus deleting the tnodeList) without forcing the converted external files to be saved. The next time Leo attempted to read the external files, the tnodeList would be missing and data would be lost.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101025080245.6089">Leo 4.8 final was released November 26, 2010. This release simplified Leo's sentinels as much as possible. This version also added "Resurrected" and "Recovered" nodes. These nodes protect against data loss, and also implicitly warn when unusual data-changing events occur. Creating this scheme may be the final chapter in the epic saga of error recovery in Leo.

::

    Added Drag and Drop of outlines
    Defined abbreviations in Leo settings nodes
    Leo now uses PyEnchant to check spelling
    Deprecated the ancient Tangle and Untangle commands
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101026082911.5538">The update algorithm guarantees *only* that writing an updated @clean outline will generate the updated **public** file.  **Ambiguous lines** could be placed either at the end of one node or the beginning of the following nodes. The update algorithm *guesses* that such lines should be placed at the end of the previous node.

Happily, guesses are not serious. Once you move an ambiguous node and save the Leo file, the update algorithm will not have to guess where the line belongs the next time Leo reads the @clean files.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9400">Edits user attributes in a Qt frame.

This plugin creates a frame for editing attributes similar to::

    Name:   Fred Blogs
    Home:   555-555-5555
    Work:   555-555-5556

``attrib_edit`` is also intended to provide attribute editing for other plugins, see below.

The attributes can be stored in different ways, three modes are implemented currently:

v.u mode
  These attributes are stored in the "unknownAttributes" (uA) data for
  each node, accessed via v.u.

Field:
  Attributes are lines starting (no whitespace) with "AttributeName:" in
  the body text.

@Child
  Attributes are the head strings of child nodes when the head string
  starts with '@AttributeName' where the first letter (second character)
  must be capitalized.

The plugin defines the following commands, available either in the plugin's sub-menu in the Plugins menu, or as ``Alt-X attrib-edit-*``.

attrib-edit-modes
    Select which attribute setting / getting modes to use.  More than one mode
    can be used at the same time.

    You can also control which modes are active by listing them 
    with the @data attrib_edit_active_modes setting.  For example::

        Field:
        @Child
        # v.u mode

    would cause only the "Field:" and "@Child" modes to be active be default.

attrib-edit-manage
    Select which attributes, from all attributes seen so
    far in this outline, to include on the current node.

attrib-edit-scan
    Scan the entire outline for attributes so ``attrib-edit-manage``
    has the complete list.

attrib-edit-create
    Create a new attribute on the current node.  If Field: or @Child modes
    are active, they simply remind you how to create an attribute in the log pane.
    If the "v.u mode" mode is active, you're prompted for a path for the attribute.
    For example::

        addressbook First

    to store the attribute in v.u['addressbook']['_edit']['First']

    As a convenience, entering a path like::

        todo metadata created|creator|revised

    would create::

        v.u.['todo']['metadata']['_edit']['created']
        v.u.['todo']['metadata']['_edit']['creator']
        v.u.['todo']['metadata']['_edit']['revised']


**Technical details**

See the source for complete documentation for use with other plugins. Here are some points of interest:

- In addition to ``v.u['addressbook']['_edit']['first']``, paths like ``v.u['addressbook']['_edit']['_int']['age']`` may be used to identify type, although currently there's no difference in the edit widget.

- In the future the plugin may allow other plugins to register to provide attribute path information, instead of just scanning for ['_edit'] entries in v.u.

- Currently there's no sorting of the attributes in "v.u mode", which is a problem for some applications.  It's unclear where the desired order would be stored, without even more repetition in v.u.  When other plugins can register to manipulate the attribute list each plugin could address this, with unordered presentation in the absence of the client plugin.

- There's code to have the editor appear in a tab instead of its own area under the body editor, but (a) this is always being buried by output in the log window, and (b) there's a bug which leaves some (harmless) ghost widgets in the background.  Enable by @setting ``attrib_edit_placement`` to 'tab'.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9401">Manipulates appearance of individual tree widget items.

This plugin is mostly an example of how to change the appearance of headlines. As such, it does a relatively mundane chore of highlighting @thin, @auto, @shadow nodes in bold.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9402">Defines various useful actions for context menus (Qt only).

Examples are:

- Edit in $EDITOR
- Edit @thin node in $EDITOR (remember to do "refresh" after this!)
- Refresh @thin node from disk (e.g. after editing it in external editor)
- Go to clone

Here's an example on how to implement your own context menu items in your plugins::

    def nextclone_rclick(c,p, menu):
        """ Go to next clone """

        # only show the item if you are on a clone
        # this is what makes this "context sensitive"
        if not p.isCloned():
            return    

        def nextclone_rclick_cb():
            c.goToNextClone()

        # 'menu' is a QMenu instance that was created by Leo 
        # in response to right click on tree item

        action = menu.addAction("Go to clone")
        action.connect(action, QtCore.SIGNAL("triggered()"), nextclone_rclick_cb)

And call this in your plugin *once*::

    g.tree_popup_handlers.append(nextclone_rclick)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9403">Adds "Back" and "Forward" buttons (Qt only).

Creates "back" and "forward" buttons on button bar. These navigate
the node history.

This plugin does not need specific setup. If the plugin is loaded, the buttons 
will be available. The buttons use the icon specified in the active Qt style

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9404">Creates a wizard that creates @auto nodes.

Opens a file dialog and recursively creates @auto &amp; @path nodes from the path
where the selected file is (the selected file itself doesn't matter.)

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9405">Adds a fast-to-use search widget, like the "Find in files" feature of many editors.

Just load the plugin, activate "Nav" tab, enter search text and press enter.

The pattern to search for is, by default, a case *insensitive* fnmatch pattern
(e.g. foo*bar), because they are typically easier to type than regexps. If you
want to search for a regexp, use 'r:' prefix, e.g. r:foo.*bar.

Regexp matching is case sensitive; if you want to do a case-insensitive regular
expression search (or any kind of case-sensitive search in the first place), do it
by searching for "r:(?i)Foo". (?i) is a standard feature of Python regular expression
syntax, as documented in 

http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9406">Provides a Scrolled Message Dialog service for Qt.

The plugin can display messages supplied as plain text or formatted as html. In
addition the plugin can accept messages in rst format and convert them to be
displayed as html.

The displayed format can be controlled by the user via check boxes, so rst
messages may be viewed either as text or as html. Html messages can also be
viewed as raw text, which will be a good debug feature when creating complex
dynamically generated html messages.

The user interface is provided by a ScrolledMessage.ui file which is dynamically
loaded each time a new dialog is loaded.

The dialog is not modal and many dialogs can exist at one time. Dialogs can be
named and output directed to a dialog with a specific name.

The plugin is invoked like this::

    g.doHook('scrolledMessage', c=c, msg='message', title='title',  ...etc    )

or::

    g.app.gui.runScrolledMessageDialog(c=c, ...etc)

All parameters are optional except c.

**Parameters**

msg:
    The text to be displayed (html, rst, plain).

    If the text starts with 'rst:' it is assumed to be rst text and
    is converted to html for display after the rst: prefix has been removed.
    If the text starts with '&lt;' it is assumed to be html.
    These auto detection features can be overridden by 'flags'.

label:
    The text to appear in a label above the display. If it is '', the label is hidden.

title:
    The title to appear on the window or dock.

flags:
    Says what kind of message: 'rst', 'text', 'html'. This overrides auto-detection.

    Flags can be combined, for example, 'rst html' causes the message
    to be interpreted as rst and displayed as html.

..  To Do
..  - Add parameters to control position, size, closing, hiding etc.
..  - Save or print files from the dialog.
..  - Add an option to put the dialog in leo's log notebook.
..  - Add @settings to control default behavior
..  - Provide a menu of plugins that allows their docstring to be displayed.
..  - Provide a menu of @rst nodes in the current outline, automatically track changes
..    if it is set to display any of these nodes.

current c,p,g to spyder interactive session. spyder-update also shows the window

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9408">Adds simple "sticky notes" feature (popout editors) for Qt gui.

Adds the following (``Alt-X``) commands:

``stickynote``
  pop out current node as a sticky note
``stickynoter``
  pop out current node as a rich text note
``stickynoteenc``
  pop out current node as an encrypted note
``stickynoteenckey``
  enter a new en/decryption key
``tabula``
  add the current node to the stickynotes in the `Tabula`
  sticky note dock window, and show the window
``tabula-show``
  show the `Tabula` sticky note dock window
  (without adding the current node)
``tabula-marked``
  add all marked nodes to the stickynotes in the `Tabula`
  sticky note dock window, and show the window

Sticky notes are synchronized (both ways) with their parent Leo node.

Encrypted mode requires the python-crypto module.

The first time you open a note in encrypted mode you'll be asked for a pass
phrase. That phrase will be used for the rest of the session, you can change it
with ``Alt-X`` ``stickynoteenckey``, but probably won't need to.

The encrypted note is stored in base64 encoded *encrypted* text in the parent
Leo node, if you forget the pass phrase there's no way to un-encrypt it again.
Also, you must not edit the text in the Leo node.

When **creating an encrypted note**, you should **start with an empty node**.
If you want to encrypt text that already exists in a node, select-all cut it to
empty the node, then paste it into the note.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9409">Provides to-do list and simple task management for leo (Qt only).

viewrendered.py creates a single ``Alt-X`` style command, ``viewrendered``,
which opens a new window where the current body text is rendered as HTML

and::

    &lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;h1&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;This&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; a line of text.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9416">Allows the user to import Cisco configuration files.

Adds the "File:Import:Import Cisco Configuration" menu item. The plugin will:

1)  Create a new node, under the current node, where the configuration will be written. This node will typically have references to several sections (see below).

2)  Create sections (child nodes) for the indented blocks present in the original config file. These child nodes will have sub-nodes grouping similar blocks (e.g. there will be an 'interface' child node, with as many sub-nodes as there are real interfaces in the configuration file).

3)  Create sections for the custom keywords specified in the customBlocks[] list in importCiscoConfig(). You can modify this list to specify different keywords. DO NOT put keywords that are followed by indented blocks (these are taken care of by point 2 above). The negated form of the keywords (for example, if the keyword is 'service', the negated form is 'no service') is also included in the sections.

4)  Not display consecutive empty comment lines (lines with only a '!').

All created sections are alphabetically ordered.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9417">Modifies the Python @auto importer so that the importer puts the __init__ method (ctor) into the body of the class node.

This makes it easier to keep the instance variable docs in the class docstring in sync. with the ivars as manipulated by __init__, saves repeating explanations in both places.

Note that this is done *after* the consistency checks by the @auto import code, so using this plugin is at your own risk.  It will change the order of declarations if other methods are declared before __init__.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9420">Creates new nodes containing parameterized section reference.

This plugin adds nodes under the currently selected tree that are to act as section references. To do so, go the Outline menu and select the 'Parameterize Section Reference' command. This plugin looks for a top level node called 'Parameterized Nodes'. If it finds a headline that matches the section reference it adds a node/nodes to the current tree.

To see this in action, do the following:

0. **Important**: in the examples below, type &lt;&lt; instead of &lt; &lt; and
   type &gt;&gt; instead of &gt; &gt;.  Docstrings can not contain section references!

1. Create a node called 'Parameterized Nodes', with a sub-node called  &lt; &lt; Meow \&gt;\&gt;.
   The body of &lt; &lt; Meow &gt; &gt; should have the text::

        I mmmm sooo happy I could  &lt; &lt; 1$  &gt; &gt;.
        But I don't know if I have all the  &lt; &lt; 2$  &gt; &gt;
        money in the world.

2. In a node called A, type::

        &lt; &lt; meow( purrrrrr, zzooot )  &gt; &gt;
        (leave the cursor at the end of the line)

3. In a node called B, type::

         &lt; &lt; meow ( spit or puke, blinking  )  &gt; &gt;
        (leave the cursor at the end of the line)

4. Leave the cursor in Node A at the designated point.

5. Go to Outline and select Parameterize Section Reference.

The plugin searches the outline, goes to level one and finds a Node with the Headline, "Parameterized Nodes". It looks for nodes under that headline with the the headline &lt;\&lt; meow &gt;\&gt;. It then creates this node structure under Node A::

        &lt; &lt; meow ( purrrrrr, zzooot ) &gt; &gt;
            &lt; &lt;2$&gt; &gt;
            &lt; &lt;1$&gt; &gt;

6. Examine the new subnodes of Node A:  

        &lt; &lt; meow ( purrrrrr, zzooot ) &gt; &gt; contains the body text of the &lt; &lt; meow &gt; &gt; node.
        &lt; &lt; 1$ &gt; &gt; contains the word purrrrrr.
        &lt; &lt; 2$ &gt; &gt; contains the word zzooot.

7. Go to Node B, and leave the cursor at the designated point.

Go to Outline Menu and select Parameterize Section Reference command.

8. Examine the new subnodes of Node B.

It's a lot easier to use than to explain!

You would typically want to override putNormalToken or its allies. Templates for these methods have been provided. You may, however, override any methods you like. You could even define your own class entirely, provided you implement the prettyPrintNode method.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9428">Creates buttons to move nodes quickly to other nodes.

Quickly move/copy/clone nodes from around the tree to one or more target nodes. It can also create bookmark and tagging functionality in an outline (see `Set Parent Notes` below).

Adds `Move/Clone/Copy To Last Child Button` and `Move/Clone/Copy To First Child Button`, `Link To/From` and `Jump To` commands to the Move sub-menu on the Outline menu, and each node's context menu, if the `contextmenu` plugin is enabled.

Select a node ``Foo`` and then use the `Move To Last Child Button` command. This adds a 'to Foo' button to the button bar. Now select another node and click the 'to Foo' button. The selected node will be moved to the last child of the node 'Foo'.

`To First Child Button` works the same way, except that moved nodes are inserted as the first child of the target node.

`Clone` and `Copy` variants are like `Move`, but clone or copy instead of moving.

`Link` works in conjunction with the `backlink` plugin (and also the `graphcanvas` plugin) creating a link to/from the target and current nodes.

`Jump` buttons act as bookmarks, taking you to the target node.

You can right click on any of these buttons to access their context menu:

  Goto Target
    takes you to the target node (like a `Jump` button).
  Make Permanent
    makes the button permanent, it will reappear
    when the file is saved / closed / re-opened.
  Set Parent
    allows you to move buttons to sub-menu items of other
    `quickMove` buttons.  This implicitly makes the moved button
    permanent.  It also causes the moved button to lose its context menu.
  Remove Button
    comes from the `mod_scripting` plugin, and just
    removes the button for the rest of the current session.

Set Parent Notes
  `Set Parent` doesn't allow you to do anything with `quickMove` you couldn't
  do with a long strip of separate buttons, but it collects quickMove buttons
  as sub-menu items of one quickMove button, saving a lot of toolbar space.

Bookmarks 
  Create somewhere out of the way in your outline a node called
  `Bookmarks`. Use the quickMove menu to make it a `Jump To` button, and use its
  context menu to make it permanent. There is no particular reason to jump to
  it, but it needs to be a `quickMove` button of some kind.

  Now, when you want to bookmark a node, first use the quickMove menu to make
  the node a `Jump To` button, and then use the context menu on the button to
  set its parent to your `Bookmarks` button.  It becomes a sub-menu item
  of the `Bookmarks` button.

Tags
  In conjunction with the `backlinks` plugin you can use `quickMove` to
  tag nodes.   The `backlinks` plugin adds a `Links` tab to the `Log pane`.

  Create somewhere in your outline a node called `Tags`. Use the quickMove menu
  to make it a `Jump To` button, and use its context menu to make it permanent.
  Clicking on it will jump you to your tag list. Now create a node under the
  `Tags` node for each tag you want. The node's name will be the tag name, and
  can be changed later. Then use the quickMove menu to make each of these nodes
  a `Link To` button, and then use the context menu on the button to set its
  parent to your `Tags` button. It becomes a sub-menu item of the `Tags` button.

  To see the tags on a node, you need to be looking at the `Links` tab in the
  `Log pane`.  To see all the nodes with a particular tag, click on the `Tags`
  button to jump to the tag list, and select the node which names the tag of
  interest.  The nodes with that tag will be listed in th `Links` tab in the
  `Log pane`.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9448">Synchronizes @path nodes with folders.

If a node is named '@path path_to_folder', the content (file and folder names) of the folder and the children of that node will synchronized whenever the node's status-iconbox is double clicked.

For files not previously seen in a folder a new node will appear on top of the children list (with a mark).

Folders appear in the list as /foldername/. If you double click on the icon-box of the folder node, it will have children added to it based on the contents of the folder on disk. These folders have the '@path' directive as the first line of their body text.

When files are deleted from the folder and the list is updated by double clicking the files will appear in the list as *filename* (or */foldername/*).

You can describe files and directories in the body of the nodes.

You can organize files and directories with organizer nodes, an organizer node name cannot contain with '/'.

Files and folders can be created by entering a node with the required name as its headline (must start and/or end with "/" for a folder) and then double clicking on the node's status-iconbox.

\@auto nodes can be set up for existing files can be loaded by double clicking on the node's status-iconbox. If you prefer @shadow or something else use the "active_path_attype" setting, without the "@".

There are commands on the Plugins active_path submenu:

- show path - show the current path
- set absolute path - changes a node "/dirname/" to "@path /absolute/path/to/dirname".
- purge vanished (recursive) - remove *entries*
- update recursive - recursive load of directories, use with caution on large
  file systems

If you want to use an input other than double clicking a node's status-iconbox set active_path_event to a value like 'iconrclick1' or 'iconclick1'.

There are @settings for ignoring directory entries and automatically loading files.  ``re.search`` is used, rather than ``re.match``, so patterns need only match part of the filename, not the whole filename.

The body of the @setting ``@data active_path_ignore`` is a list of regex patterns, one per line.  Directory entries matching any pattern in the list will be ignored.  The names of directories used for matching will have forward slashes around them ('/dirname/'), so patterns can use this to distinguish between directories and files.

The body of the @setting ``@data active_path_autoload`` is a list of regex patterns, one per line.  File entries matching any pattern in the list will be loaded automatically.  This works only with files, not directories (but you can load directories recursively anyway).

Set ``@bool active_path_load_docstring = True`` to have active_path load the docstring of .py files automatically.  These nodes start with the special string::

    @language rest # AUTOLOADED DOCSTRING

which must be left intact if you want active path to be able to double-click load the file later.

\@float active_path_timeout_seconds (default 10.) controls the maximum time active_path will spend on a recursive operation.

\@int active_path_max_size (default 1000000) controls the maximum size file active_path will open without query.

active_path is a rewrite of the at_directory plugin to use @path directives (which influence @auto and other @file type directives), and to handle sub-folders more automatically.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9449">Synchronizes @folder nodes with folders.

If a node is named '@folder path_to_folder', the content (filenames) of the folder and the children of that node will be sync. Whenever a new file is put there, a new node will appear on top of the children list (with mark). So that I can put my description (i.e. annotation) as the content of that node. In this way, I can find any files much easier from leo.

Moreover, I add another feature to allow you to group files(in leo) into children of another group. This will help when there are many files in that folder. You can logically group it in leo (or even clone it to many groups), while keep every files in a flat/single directory on your computer.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9450">Executes commands in nodes whose body text starts with @produce.

WARNING: trying to execute a non-existent command will hang Leo.

To use, put in the body text of a node::

    @produce echo hi
    
This plugin creates two new commands: at-produce-all and at-produce-selected.

at-produce-all scans the entire tree for body text containing @produce. at-produce-selected just scans the selected tree.

Whatever follows @produce is executed as a command.

@produce commands are executed in the order they are found, that is, in outline order.

The at-produce commands produce a log node as the last top-level node of the outline. Any output, including error messages, should be there.

This plugin is not intended as a replacement for make or Ant, but as a simple substitute when that machinery is overkill.

'Date nodes' are nodes that have dates in their headlines. They may be added to the outline one at a time, a month's-worth at a time, or a year's-worth at a time. The format of the labels (headlines) is configurable.

There are options to omit Saturdays and Sundays.

An 'Insert Date Nodes ...' submenu will be created (by default) in the 'Outline' menu.  This menu can be suppressed by using either of the following settings::

    - @bool suppress-datenodes-menus
    - @bool suppress-all-plugins-menus

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9454">Adds @expfolder nodes that represent folders in the file system.

Double clicking on the icon of an @expfolder heading reads the files in the directory at the path specified and creates child nodes for each file in the subfolder. Subdirectories are made into child @expfolder nodes so the tree can be easily traversed. If files have extensions specified in the expfolder.ini file they are made into @text nodes so the content of the files can be easily loaded into leo and edited. Double clicking a second time will delete all child nodes and refresh the directory listing. If there are any changed @text nodes contained inside you will be prompted about saving them.

The textextensions field on the expfolder Properties page contains a list of extensions which will be made into @text nodes, separated by spaces.

For the @text and @expfolder nodes to interact correctly, the textnode plugin must load before the expfolder plugin. This can be set using the Plugin Manager's Plugin Load Order pane.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9455">Defines actions taken when double-clicking on @&lt;file&gt; nodes and supports @file-ref nodes.

Double-clicking any kind of @&lt;file&gt; node writes out the file if changes have been made since the last save, and then runs a script on it, which is retrieved from the outline.

Scripts are located in a node whose headline is FileActions. This node can be anywhere in the outline. If there is more than one such node, the first one in outline order is used.

The children of that node are expected to contain a file pattern in the headline and the script to be executed in the body. The file name is matched against the patterns (which are Unix-style shell patterns), and the first matching node is selected. If the filename is a path, only the last item is matched.

Execution of the scripts is similar to the "Execute Script" command in Leo. The main difference is that the namespace in which the scripts are run contains these elements:

- 'c' and 'g' and 'p': as in the regular execute script command.

- 'filename': the filename from the @file directive.

- 'shellScriptInWindow', a utility function that runs a shell script in an external windows, thus permitting programs to be called that require user interaction

File actions are implemented for all kinds @&lt;file&gt; nodes. There is also a new node type @file-ref for referring to files purely for the purpose of file actions, Leo does not do anything with or to such files.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9458">Opens files with their default platform program.

Double-clicking @mime nodes will attempt to open the named file as if opened from a file manager. @path parent nodes are used to find the full filename path.  Fore example::

    @mime foodir/document.pdf

The string setting 'mime_open_cmd' allows specifying a program to handle opening files::

    @settings
        @string mime_open_cmd = see
        .. or ..
        @string mime_open_cmd = see %s

Where '%s' is replaced with the full pathname.

**Note**: This plugin terminates handling of the 'icondclick1' event by returning True. If another plugin using this event (e.g. vim.py) is also enabled, the order in @enabled-plugins matters. For example: if vim.py is enabled before mime.py, double-clicking on an @mime node will both open the body text in [g]vim AND call the mime_open_cmd.

This plugin is complementary to the UNL.py plugin's @url nodes. Use @url for opening either URLs or Uniform Node Locators in "\*.leo" files and use @mime nodes for opening files on the local file system. It also replaces the startfile.py plugin, where here the headline must start with @mime to activate this plugin.

For other sys.platform's, add an elif case to the section "guess file association handler" and either define a default _mime_open_cmd string, where "%s" will be replaced with the filename, or define a function taking the filename string as its only argument and set as open_func.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9459">Allows Leo to write a file to multiple locations.

This plugin acts as a post-write mechanism, a file must be written to the file system for it to work. At this point it is not a replacement for @path or an absolute path, it works in tandem with them.

To use, place @multipath at the start of a line in the root node or an ancestor of the node. The format is (On Unix-like systems)::

    @multipath /machine/unit/:/machine/robot/:/machine/

New in version 0.6 of this plugin: the separator used above is ';' not ':', for example::

    @multipath c:\prog\test;c:\prog\unittest

It will places copy of the written file in each of these directories.

There is an additional directive that simplifies common paths, it is called
@multiprefix. By typing @multiprefix with a path following it, before a
@multipath directive you set the beginning of the paths in the @multipath
directive. For example::

    #@multiprefix /leo #@multipath /plugins 

or::

    #@multiprefix /leo/
    #@multipath plugins: fungus : drain

copies a file to /leo/plugins /leo/fungus /leo/drain.

**Note**: I put # in front of the directives here because I don't want someone browsing this file to accidentally save multiple copies of this file to their system! 

The @multiprefix stays in effect for the entire tree until reset with another
@multiprefix directive. @multipath is cumulative, in that for each @multipath in
an ancestor a copy of the file is created. These directives must at the beginning of the line and by themselves.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9461">Creates and updates @read-only nodes.

Here's my first attempt at customizing leo. I wanted to have the ability to import files in "read-only" mode, that is, in a mode where files could only be read by leo (not tangled), and also kept in sync with the content on the drive.

The reason for this is for example that I have external programs that generate resource files. I want these files to be part of a leo outline, but I don't want leo to tangle or in any way modify them. At the same time, I want them to be up-to-date in the leo outline.

So I coded the directive plugin. It has the following characteristics:

- It reads the specified file and puts it into the node content.

- If the @read-only directive was in the leo outline already, and the file content on disk has changed from what is stored in the outline, it marks the node as changed and prints a "changed" message to the log window; if, on the other hand, the file content has _not_ changed, the file is simply read and the node is not marked as changed.

- When you write a @read-only directive, the file content is added to the node immediately, i.e. as soon as you press Enter (no need to call a menu entry to import the content).

- If you want to refresh/update the content of the file, just edit the headline and press Enter. The file is reloaded, and if in the meantime it has changed, a "change" message is sent to the log window.

- The body text of a @read-only file cannot be modified in leo.

The syntax to access files in @read-only via ftp/http is the following::

    @read-only http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0791.txt
    @read-only ftp://ftp.someserver.org/filepath

If FTP authentication (username/password) is required, it can be specified as follows::

    @read-only ftp://username:password@ftp.someserver.org/filepath

For more details, see the doc string for the class FTPurl.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9462">Runs a program and interface Leos through its input/output/error streams.

Double clicking the icon box whose headlines are @run 'cmd args' will execute the command. There are several other features, including @arg and @input nodes.

The run_nodes.py plugin introduce two new nodes that transform leo into a terminal. It was mostly intended to run compilers and debuggers while having the possibility to send messages to the program.

Double clicking on the icon of an node whose headline is @run &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt; will launch &lt;command&gt; with the given arguments. It will also mark the node. # Terminates the argument list. @run # &lt;comment&gt; is also valid.

@in nodes are used to send input to the running process. Double clicking on
the icon of an @in &lt;message&gt; node will append a "\n" to &lt;message&gt; and write it to the program, no matter where the node is placed. If no @run node is active, nothing happens.

The body text of every child, in which the headlines do not begin with '@run' or '@in', will be appended to &lt;command&gt;, allowing you to add an unlimited number of arguments to &lt;command&gt;.

The output of the program is written in the log pane (Error output in red). When the program exit the node is set unmarked and the return value is displayed... When the enter key is pressed in the body pane of an active @run node the content of it body pane is written to the program and then emptied ready for another line of input. If the node have @run nodes in its descendants, they will be launched successively. (Unless one returned an exit code other than 0, then it will stop there)

Analysis environments like SQL, R, scipy, ipython, etc. can be used by pasting sections of text from an editor (Leo) and a shell window.  Results can be pasted back into the editor.

This plugin streamlines the process by communicating with ``screen``, the shell multiplexer

**Commands**

leoscreen-run-text
  Send the text selected in Leo's body text to the shell app.
  Selects the next line for your convenience.

leoscreen-get-line
  Insert a line of the last result from the shell into Leo's body text
  at the current insert point.  Lines are pulled one at a time starting
  from the end of the output.  Can be used repeatedly to get the
  output you want into Leo.

leoscreen-get-all
  Insert all of the last result from the shell into Leo's body text
  at the current insert point.

leoscreen-get-note
  Insert all of the last result from the shell into a new child node of
  the current node.

leoscreen-show-all
  Show the output from the last result from the shell in a temporary
  read only window. **Important**: The output is not stored.

leoscreen-show-note
  Insert all of the last result from the shell into a new child node of
  the current node and display that node a a stickynote (requires stickynote
  plugin).

leoscreen-next
  Switch screen session to next window.

leoscreen-prev
  Switch screen session to preceding window.

leoscreen-other
  Switch screen session to last window displayed.

leoscreen-get-prefix
  Interactively get prefix for inserting text into body (#, --, //, etc/)
  Can also set using::

      c.leo_screen.get_line_prefix = '#'

leoscreen-more-prompt
  Skip one less line at the end of output when fetching output into Leo.
  Adjusts lines skipped to avoid pulling in the applications prompt line.

leoscreen-less-prompt
  Skip one more line at the end of output when fetching output into Leo
  Adjusts lines skipped to avoid pulling in the applications prompt line.

**Settings**

leoscreen_prefix
  Prepended to output pulled in to Leo. The substring SPACE in this
  setting will be replaced with a space character, to allow for trailing
  spaces.

leoscreen_time_fmt
  time.strftime format for note type output headings.

**Theory of operation**

leoscreen creates a instance at c.leo_screen which has some methods which might
be useful in ``@button`` and other Leo contexts.

**Example SQL setup**

In a Leo file full of interactive SQL analysis, I have::

    @settings
        @string leoscreen_prefix = --SPACE
    @button rollback
        import time
        c.leo_screen.run_text('ROLLBACK;  -- %s\n' % time.asctime())
    @button commit
        import time
        cmd = 'COMMIT;  -- %s' % time.asctime()
        c.leo_screen.run_text(cmd)
        c.leo_screen.insert_line(cmd)

which creates a button to rollback messed up queries, another to commit (requiring additional action to supply the newline as a safeguard) and sets the prefix to "-- " for text pulled back from the SQL session into Leo.

**Implementation note**: screen behaves differently if screen -X is executed with the same stdout as the target screen, vs. a different stdout. Although stdout is ignored, Popen() needs to ensure it's not just inherited.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9469">Creates script buttons and @button, @command, @plugin and @script nodes.

This plugin puts buttons in the icon area. Depending on settings the plugin will create the 'Run Script', the 'Script Button' and the 'Debug Script' buttons.

The 'Run Script' button is simply another way of doing the Execute Script command: it executes the selected text of the presently selected node, or the entire text if no text is selected.

The 'Script Button' button creates *another* button in the icon area every time you push it. The name of the button is the headline of the presently selected node. Hitting this *newly created* button executes the button's script.

For example, to run a script on any part of an outline do the following:

1.  Select the node containing the script.
2.  Press the scriptButton button.  This will create a new button.
3.  Select the node on which you want to run the script.
4.  Push the *new* button.

That's all.

For every @button node, this plugin creates two new minibuffer commands: x and delete-x-button, where x is the 'cleaned' name of the button. The 'x' command is equivalent to pushing the script button.

You can specify **global buttons** in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo by putting @button nodes as children of an @buttons node in an @settings trees. Such buttons are included in all open .leo (in a slightly different color). Actually, you can specify global buttons in any .leo file, but @buttons nodes affect all later opened .leo files so usually you would define global buttons in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo.

The cleaned name of an @button node is the headline text of the button with:

- Leading @button or @command removed,
- @key and all following text removed,
- @args and all following text removed,
- all non-alphanumeric characters converted to a single '-' characters.

Thus, cleaning headline text converts it to a valid minibuffer command name.

You can delete a script button by right-clicking on it, or by executing the delete-x-button command.

The 'Debug Script' button runs a script using an external debugger.

This plugin optionally scans for @button nodes, @command, @plugin nodes and
@script nodes whenever a .leo file is opened.

- @button nodes create script buttons.
- @command nodes create minibuffer commands.
- @plugin nodes cause plugins to be loaded.
- @script nodes cause a script to be executed when opening a .leo file.

Such nodes may be security risks. This plugin scans for such nodes only if the corresponding atButtonNodes, atPluginNodes, and atScriptNodes constants are set to True in this plugin.

You can specify the following options in leoSettings.leo.  See the node:
@settings--&gt;Plugins--&gt;scripting plugin.  Recommended defaults are shown::

    @bool scripting-at-button-nodes = True
    True: adds a button for every @button node.

    @bool scripting-at-commands-nodes = True
    True: define a minibuffer command for every @command node.

    @bool scripting-at-plugin-nodes = False
    True: dynamically loads plugins in @plugins nodes when a window is created.

    @bool scripting-at-script-nodes = False
    True: dynamically executes script in @script nodes when a window is created.
    This is dangerous!

    @bool scripting-create-debug-button = False
    True: create Debug Script button.

    @bool scripting-create-run-script-button = False
    True: create Run Script button.
    Note: The plugin creates the press-run-script-button regardless of this setting.

    @bool scripting-create-script-button-button = True
    True: create Script Button button in icon area.
    Note: The plugin creates the press-script-button-button
          regardless of this setting.

    @int scripting-max-button-size = 18
    The maximum length of button names: longer names are truncated.

You can bind key shortcuts to @button and @command nodes as follows.

@button name @key=shortcut

    Binds the shortcut to the script in the script button. The button's name is
    'name', but you can see the full headline in the status line when you move the
    mouse over the button.

@command name @key=shortcut

    Creates a new minibuffer command and binds shortcut to it. As with @buffer
    nodes, the name of the command is the cleaned name of the headline.

This plugin is based on ideas from e's dynabutton plugin, quite possibly the most brilliant idea in Leo's history.

You can run the script with sys.argv initialized to string values using @args. For example::

    @button test-args @args = a,b,c

will set sys.argv to [u'a',u'b',u'c']

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9473">A minimal http plugin for Leo, based on AsyncHttpServer.py.

Use this plugin is as follows:

1. Start Leo with the plugin enabled. You will see a purple message that says something like::

    http serving enabled on port 8130...

2. Start a web browser, and enter the following url: http://localhost:8130/

You will see a a "top" level page containing one link for every open .leo file. Start clicking :-)

You can use the browser's refresh button to update the top-level view in the browser after you have opened or closed files.

To enable this plugin put this into your file::

    @settings
    @bool http_active = True
    @int  port = 8130
    @string rst_http_attributename = 'rst_http_attribute'

**Note**: the browser_encoding constant (defined in the top node of this file) must match the character encoding used in the browser. If it does not, non-ascii characters will look strange.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9475">Creates stand-alone slideshows containing screenshots.

This plugin defines five commands. The **apropos-slides** command prints this message to Leo's log pane. The **slide-show-info** command prints the settings in effect.

The **make-slide** and **make-slide-show** commands, collectively called **slide commands**, create collections of slides from **@slideshow** trees containing **@slide** nodes.

Slides may link to screenshots. The slide commands can generate screenshots from **@screenshot-tree** nodes, but this feature has proven to be clumsy and inflexible. It is usually more convenient to use screenshots taken with a program such as Wink. The **meld-slides** command creates references to externally-generated screenshots within @slide nodes.

\@slide nodes may contain **@url nodes**. These @url nodes serve two purposes. First, they allow you to see various files (slides, initial screenshots, working files and final screenshots). Second, these @url nodes guide the meld script and the four commands defined by this plugin (see below). By inserting or deleting these @url nodes you (or your scripts) can customize how the commands (and meld) work. In effect, the @url nodes become per-slide settings.

**Prerequisites**

Inkscape (Required)
  An SVG editor: http://www.inkscape.org/
  Allows the user to edit screenshots.
  Required to create final output (PNG) files.

PIL (Optional but highly recommended)
  The Python Imaging Library,
  http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Wink (Optional)
  A program that creates slideshows and slides.
  http://www.debugmode.com/wink/

**Summary**

@slideshow &lt;slideshow-name&gt;
  Creates the folder:
  &lt;sphinx_path&gt;/slides/&lt;slideshow-name&gt;

@slide &lt;ignored text&gt;
  Creates slide-&lt;slide-number&gt;.html
  (in the sphinx _build directory).
  **Note**: the plugin skips any @slide nodes
  with empty body text.

@screenshot
  Specifies the contents of the screenshot.

**Options** are child nodes of @slideshow or @slide nodes that control the make-slide and make-slide-show commands. See the Options section below.

The make-slide and make-slide-show commands create the following @url nodes as children of each @slide node:

@url built slide
  Contains the absolute path to the final slide in
  the _build/html subfolder of the slideshow
  folder. If present, this @url node completely
  disables rebuilding the slide.

@url screenshot
  Contains the absolute path to the original
  screenshot file. If present, this @url node
  inhibits taking the screenshot.

@url working file
  Contains the absolute path to the working file.
  If present, this @url node disables taking the
  screenshot, creating the working file. The final
  output file will be regenerated if the working
  file is newer than the final output file.

@url final output file
  Contains the absolute path to the final output
  file.

Thus, to completely recreate an @slide node, you must delete any of the following nodes that appear as its children::

    @url screenshot
    @url working file
    @url built slide

**Making slides**

For each slide, the make-slide and make-slide-show commands do the following:

1. Create a slide.

  If the @slide node contains an @screenshot tree,
  the plugin appends an ``.. image::`` directive
  referring to the screenshot to the body text of
  the @slide node. The plugin also creates a child
  @image node referring to the screenshot.

2. (Optional) Create a screenshot.

  The plugin creates a screenshot for an @slide
  node only if the @slide node contains an
  @screenshot node as a direct child.

  **Important**: this step has largely been
  superseded by the ``@button meld`` script in
  LeoDocs.leo.

  Taking a screenshot involves the following steps:

  A. Create the **target outline**: screenshot-setup.leo.

    The target outline contains consists of all
    the children (and their descendants) of the
    @screenshot node.

  B. Create the **screenshot**, a bitmap (PNG) file.

    The slide commands take a screen shot of the
    target outline. The @pause option opens the
    target outline but does *not* take the
    screenshot. The user must take the screenshot
    manually. For more details, see the the
    options section below.

  C. Convert the screenshot file to a **work file**.

    The work file is an SVG (Scalable Vector
    Graphics) file: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/.

  D. (Optional) Edit the work file.

    If the @slide node has a child @edit node, the
    plugin opens Inkscape so that the user can
    edit the work file.

  E. Render the **final output file**.

    The plugin calls Inkscape non-interactively to
    render the final output file (a PNG image)
    from the work file. If the Python Imaging
    Library (PIL) is available, this step will use
    PIL to improve the quality of the final output
    file.

3. Build the slide using Sphinx.

  After making all files, the plugins runs Sphinx
  by running 'make html' in the slideshow folder.
  This command creates the final .html files in the
  _build/html subfolder of the slideshow folder.

4. Create url nodes.

  Depending on options, and already-existing @url
  nodes, the make-slide and make-slide-show
  commands may create one or more of the following
  @url nodes::

    @url built slide
    @url screenshot
    @url working file 
    @url final output file

**Options and settings**

You specify options in the headlines of nodes. **Global options** appear as direct children of @slideshow nodes and apply to all @slide nodes unless overridden by a local option. **Local options** appear as direct children of an @slide node and apply to only to that @slide node.

**Global options nodes**

The following nodes may appear *either* as a direct child of the @slideshow node or as the direct child of an @slide node.

@sphinx_path = &lt;path&gt;
  This directory contains the slides directory,
  and the following files: 'conf.py',
  'Leo4-80-border.jpg', 'Makefile' and 'make.bat'.

@screenshot_height = &lt;int&gt;
  The height in pixels of screenshots.

@screenshot_width = &lt;int&gt;
  The height in pixels of screenshots.

@template_fn = &lt;path&gt;
  The absolute path to inkscape-template.svg

@title = &lt;any text&gt;
  The title to use for one slide or the entire
  slideshow.

@title_pattern = &lt;pattern&gt;
  The pattern used to generate patterns for one
  slide or the entire slideshow. The title is
  computed as follows::

    d = {
        'slideshow_name':slideshow_name,
        'slide_name':    slide_name,
        'slide_number':  sc.slide_number,
    }
    title = (pattern % (d)).title()

  If neither an @title or @title_pattern option
  node applies, the title is the headline of the
  @slide node. If this is empty, the default
  pattern is::

    '%(slideshow_name)s:%(slide_number)s'

\@verbose = True/False
  True (or true or 1):  generate informational message.
  False (or false or 0): suppress informational messages.

\@wink_path = &lt;path&gt;
  This path contains screenshots created by wink.
  This is used only by the meld-slides command.

**Local options nodes**

The following nodes are valid only as the direct child of an @slide node.

@callout &lt;any text&gt;
  Generates a text callout in the working .svg file.
  An @slide node may have several @callout children.

@edit = True/False
  If True (or true or 1) the plugin enters
  Inkscape interactively after taking a
  screenshot.

@markers = &lt;list of integers&gt;
  Generates 'numbered balls' in the working .svg file.

@pause = True/False
  If True (or true or 1) the user must take the
  screenshot manually. Otherwise, the plugin takes
  the screenshot automatically.

  If the slide node contains an @pause node as one
  of its directive children, the slide commands
  open the target node, but do *not* take a screen
  shot.

  The user may adjust the screen as desired, for
  example by selecting menus or showing dialogs.
  The *user* must then take the screen shot
  manually. **Important**: the screenshot need not
  be of Leo--it could be a screenshot of anything
  on the screen.

  As soon as the user closes the target
  outline, the slide commands look for the screen
  shot on the clipboard. If found, the slide
  commands save the screenshot to the screenshot
  file.

@screenshot
  The root of a tree that becomes the entire
  contents of screenshot. No screenshot is taken
  if this node does not exist.

@select &lt;headline&gt;
  Causes the given headline in the @screenshot
  outline to be selected before taking the screenshot.

**Settings**

@string screenshot-bin = &lt;path to inkscape.exe&gt;
  The full path to the Inkscape program.   

**File names**

Suppose the @slide node is the n'th @slide node in the @slideshow tree whose sanitized name is 'name'. The following files will be created in (relative to) the slideshow directory::

    slide-n.html.txt:   the slide's rST source.
    screenshot-n.png:   the original screenshot.
    screenshot-n.svg:   the working file.
    slide-n.png:        the final output file.
    _build/html/slide-n.html: the final slide.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9477">Manages BibTeX files with Leo.

Create a bibliographic database by putting '@bibtex filename' in a headline. Entries are added as nodes, with '@entrytype key' as the headline, and the contents of the entry in body text. The plugin will automatically insert a template for the entry in the body pane when a new entry is created (hooked to pressing enter when typing the headline text). The templates are defined in dictionary 'templates' in the \&lt;\&lt;globals\&gt;\&gt; section, by default containing all required fields for every entry.

The file is written by double-clicking the node. Thus the following outline::

    -@bibtex biblio.bib
     +@book key
      author = {P. D. James},
      year = 1999

will be written in the file 'biblio.bib' as::

    @book{key,
    author = {P. D. James},
    year= 1999}

Strings are defined in @string nodes and they can contain multiple entries. All @string nodes are written at the start of the file. Thus the following outline::

    -@bibtext biblio.bib
     +@string
      j1 = {Journal1}
     +@article AUj1
      author = {P. D. James},
      journal = j1
     +@string
      j2 = {Journal2}
      j3 = {Journal3}

Will be written as::

    @string{j1 = {Journal1}}
    @string{j2 = {Journal2}}
    @string{j3 = {Journal3}}

    @article{AUj1,
    author = {P. D. James},
    journal = j1}

No error checking is made on the syntax. The entries can be organized under nodes --- if the headline doesn't start with '@', the headline and body text are ignored, but the child nodes are parsed as usual.

BibTeX files can be imported by creating an empty node with '@bibtex filename' in the headline. Double-clicking it will read the file 'filename' and parse it into a @bibtex tree. No syntax checking is made, 'filename' is expected to be a valid BibTeX file.

If this plug-in loads properly, you should have an "Outline to Microsoft RTF" option added to your File &gt; Export... menu in Leo.

Settings such as outputting just the headlines (vs. headlines &amp; body text) and whether to include or ignore the contents of @file nodes are stored in the rtf_export.ini file in your Leo\plugins folder.

The default export path is also stored in the INI file. By default, it's set to c:\ so you may need to modify it depending on your system.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9483">Supports Uniform Node Locators (UNL's) for linking to nodes in any Leo file.

UNL's specify nodes within any Leo file. You can use them to create cross-Leo-file links! UNL

This plugin consists of two parts:

1) Selecting a node shows the UNL in the status line at the bottom of the Leo window. You can copy from the status line and paste it into headlines, emails, whatever.

2) Double-clicking @url nodes containing UNL's select the node specified in the UNL. If the UNL species in another Leo file, the other file will be opened.

Format of UNL's:

UNL's referring to nodes within the present outline have the form::

    headline1--&gt;headline2--&gt;...--&gt;headlineN

headline1 is the headline of a top-level node, and each successive headline is the headline of a child node.

UNL's of the form::

    file:&lt;path&gt;#headline1--&gt;...--&gt;headlineN

refer to a node specified in &lt;path&gt; For example, double clicking the following headline will take you to Chapter 8 of Leo's Users Guide::

    @url file:c:/prog/leoCvs/leo/doc/leoDocs.leo#Users Guide--&gt;Chapter 8: Customizing Leo

For example, suppose you want to email someone with comments about a Leo file. Create a comments.leo file containing @url UNL nodes. That is, headlines are @url followed by a UNL. The body text contains your comments about the nodes in the _other_ Leo file! Send the comments.leo to your friend, who can use the comments.leo file to quickly navigate to the various nodes you are talking about. As another example, you can copy UNL's into emails. The recipient can navigate to the nodes 'by hand' by following the arrows in the UNL.

**Notes**:

- At present, UNL's refer to nodes by their position in the outline. Moving a node will break the link.

- Don't refer to nodes that contain UNL's in the headline. Instead, refer to the parent or child of such nodes.

- You don't have to replace spaces in URL's or UNL's by '%20'.

This plugin puts two buttons in the icon area: a button called 'Save Hoist' and a button called 'Dehoist'. The 'Save Hoist' button hoists the presently selected node and creates a button which can later rehoist the same node. The 'Dehoist' button performs one level of dehoisting

:20100226: see also leoscreen.py for a simpler approach.

Currently implements `bash` shell and `psql` (postresql SQL db shell).

Single-line commands can be entered in the headline with a blank body, multi-line commands can be entered in the body with a descriptive title in the headline.  Press the `bash` or `psql` button to send the command to the appropriate interpreter.

The output from the command is **always** stored in a new node added as the first child of the command node.  For multi-line commands this new node is selected.  For single-line command this new node is not shown, instead the body text of the command node is updated to reflect the most recent output.  Comment delimiter magic is used to allow single-line and multi-line commands to maintain their single-line and multi-line flavors.

Both the new child nodes and the updated body text of single-line commands are timestamped.

For the `bash` button the execution directory is either the directory containing the `.leo` file, or any other path as specified by ancestor `@path` nodes.

Currently the `psql` button just connects to the default database.  ";" is required at the end of SQL statements.

    name in the plugins menu (or the **About** item in its submenu), but only if
    the plugin was loaded properly and registered with g.plugin_signon.

**Special Variable Names**

Some names defined at the top level have special significance.

__plugin_name__
    This will be used to define the name of the plugin and will be used
    as a label for its menu entry.

__plugin_priority__
    Plugins can also attempt to select the order they will appear in the menu by
    defining a __plugin_priority__. The menu will be created with the highest
    priority items first. This behavior is not guaranteed since other plugins
    can define any priority. This priority does not affect the order of calling
    handlers.
    To change the order select a number outside the range 0-200 since this range
    is used internally for sorting alphabetically. Properties and INI files.

<t tx="ekr.20101113063552.9798">Allows the definition of double-click actions.

When the user double-clicks a node this plugin checks for a match of the clicked node's headline text with a list of patterns. If a match occurs, the plugin executes the associated script.

**nodeAction** nodes may be located anywhere in the outline. Such nodes should contain one or more **pattern nodes** as children. The headline of each pattern node contains the pattern; the body text contains the script to be executed when the pattern matches the double-clicked node.

For example, the "nodeActions" node containing a "launch URL" pattern node and a "pre-process python code" node could be placed under an "@settings" node::

   @settings
   |
   +- nodeActions
      |
      +- http:\\*
      |
      +- @file *.py

**Configuration**

The nodeActions plugin supports the following global configurations using Leo's support for setting global variables within an @settings node's sub-nodes in the leoSettings.leo, myLeoSettings.leo, and the project Leo file:

@bool nodeActions_save_atFile_nodes = False

  :True:
     Double-click on an @file type node will save the file to disk
     before executing the script.

  :False:
     Double-click on an @file type node will **not** save the file to disk
     before executing the script. (default)

@int nodeActions_message_level = 1

  Specifies the type of messages to be sent to the log pane.  Specifying a
  higher message level will display that level and all lower levels.
  The following integer values are supported::

    0 no messages
    1 Plugin triggered and the patterns that were matched (default)
    2 Double-click event passed or not to next plugin
    3 Patterns that did not match
    4 Code debugging messages

**Patterns**

Pattern matching is performed using python's support for Unix shell-style patterns unless overwritten by the "X" pattern directive. The following pattern elements are supported::

    *           matches everything
    ?           matches any single character
    [&lt;seq&gt;]     matches any character in &lt;seq&gt;
    [!&lt;seq&gt;]    matches any character **not** in &lt;seq&gt;

Unix shell-style pattern matching is case insensitive and always starts from the beginning of the headline.  For example:

     ======= =========== ==============
     Pattern   Matches   Does not match
     ======= =========== ==============
     \*.py   Abc_Test.py
     .py     .py - Test  Abc_Test.py
     test*   Test_Abc.py Abc_Test.py
     ======= =========== ==============

To enable a script to run on any type of @file node (@thin, @shadow, ...), the pattern can start with "@files" to match on any external file type.  For example, the pattern "@files \*.py" will match a node with the headline "@file abcd.py".

The headline of the double-clicked node is matched against the patterns starting from the first sub-node under the "nodeActions" node to the last sub-node.

Only the script associated with the first matching pattern is invoked unless overwritten by the "V" pattern directive.

Using the "V" pattern directive allows a broad pattern such as "@files \*.py" to be invoked, and then, by placing a more restrictive pattern above it, such as "@files \*_test.py", a different script can be executed for those files requiring pre-processing::

  +- nodeActions
     |
     +- @files *_test.py
     |
     +- @files *.py

**Note**: To prevent Leo from trying to save patterns that begin with a derived file directive (@file, @auto, ...) to disk, such as "@file \*.py", place the "@ignore" directive in the body of the "nodeActions" node.

Pattern nodes can be placed at any level under the "nodeActions" node. Only nodes with no child nodes are considered pattern nodes. This allows patterns that are to be used in multiple Leo files to be read from a file.  For example, the following structure reads the pattern definition from the "C:\\Leo\\nodeActions_Patterns.txt" file::

    +- nodeActions
    |
    +- @files C:\\Leo\\nodeActions_Patterns.txt
        |
        +- http:\\*
        |
        +- @file *.py

**Pattern directives**

The following pattern specific directives can be appended to the end of a pattern (do not include the ':'):

:[X]:
  Use python's regular expression type patterns instead of the Unix
  shell-style pattern syntax.

  For example, the following patterns will match the same headline string::

     Unix shell-style pattern:
        @files *.py

     Regular Expression pattern:
        ^@files .*\.py$ [X]

:[V]:
  Matching the pattern will not block the double-click event from
  being passed to the remaining patterns.
  The "V" represents a down arrow that symbolizes the passing of the event
  to the next pattern below it.

  For example, adding the "[V]" directive to the "@files \*_test.py" in
  the Patterns section above, changes its script from being 'an
  alternate to' to being 'a pre-processor for' the "@files \*.py" script::

     +- nodeActions
        |
        +- @files *_test.py [V]
        |
        +- @files *.py

:[&gt;]:
  Matching the pattern will not block the double-click event from being
  passed to other plugins.
  The "&gt;" represents a right arrow that
  symbolizes the passing of the event to the next plugin.

  If the headline matched more than one headline,
  the double-click event will be passed to the next plugin if the
  directive is associated with any of the matched patterns.

The directive(s) for a pattern must be contained within a single set of brackets, separated from the pattern by a space, with or without a comma separator.  For example, the following specifies all three directives::

  ^@files .*\.py$ [X,V&gt;]

**Scripts**

The script for a pattern is located in the body of the pattern's node. The following global variables are available to the script::

    c
    g
    pClicked - node position of the double-clicked node
    pScript - node position of the invoked script

**Examples**

Double-clicking on a node with a "http:\\\\www.google.com" headline will invoke the script associated with the "http:\\\\\*" pattern.  The following script in the body of the pattern's node displays the URL in a browser::

     import webbrowser
     hClicked = pClicked.h     #Clicked node's Headline text
     webbrowser.open(hClicked) #Invoke browser

The following script can be placed in the body of a pattern's node to execute a command in the first line of the body of a double-clicked node::

     g.os.system('"Start /b ' + pClicked.bodyString() + '"')

This plugin takes an outline stored in Leo and converts it to html which is then either saved in a file or shown in a browser. It is based on the original leoToHTML 1.0 plugin by Dan Rahmel which had bullet list code by Mike Crowe.

The outline can be represented as a bullet list, a numbered list or using html &lt;h?&gt; type headings. Optionally, the body text may be included in the output.

If desired, only the current node will be included in the output rather than the entire outline.

An xhtml header may be included in the output, in which case the code will be valid XHTML 1.0 Strict.

The plugin is fully scriptable as all its functionality is available through a Leo_to_HTML object which can be imported and used in scripts.

**Menu items and @settings**

If this plugin loads properly, the following menu items should appear in your File &gt; Export... menu in Leo::

    Save Outline as HTML  (equivalent to export-html)
    Save Node as HTML     (equivalent to export-html-node)
    Show Outline as HTML  (equivalent to show-html)
    Show Node as HTML     (equivalent to show-html-node)

*Unless* the following appears in an @setting tree::

    @bool leo_to_html_no_menus = True

in which case the menus will **not** be created. This is so that the user can use @menu and @item to decide which commands will appear in the menu and where.

**Commands**

Several commands will also be made available

export-html
  will export to a file according to current settings.
export-html-*
  will export to a file using bullet type '*' which can be
  **number**, **bullet** or **head**.

The following commands will start a browser showing the html.

show-html
  will show the outline according to current settings.

show-html-*
  will show the outline using bullet type '*' which can be
  **number**, **bullet** or **head**.

The following commands are the same as above except only the current node is converted::

    export-html-node
    export-html-node-*
    show-html-node
    show-html-node-*

**Properties**

There are several settings that can appear in the leo_to_html.ini properties file in leo's plugins folder or be set via the Plugins &gt; leo_to_html &gt; Properties... menu. These are:

exportpath:
    The path to the folder where you want to store the generated html file.
    Default: c:\\

flagjustheadlines:
    Default: 'Yes' to include only headlines in the output.

flagignorefiles:
    Default: 'Yes' to ignore @file nodes.

use_xhtml:
    Yes to include xhtml doctype declarations and make the file valid XHTML 1.0 Strict.
    Otherwise only a simple &lt;html&gt; tag is used although the output will be xhtml
    compliant otherwise. Default: Yes

bullet_type:
    If this is 'bullet' then the output will be in the form of a bulleted list.
    If this is 'number' then the output will be in the form of a numbered list.
    If this is 'heading' then the output will use &lt;h?&gt; style headers.

    Anything else will result in &lt;h?&gt; type tags being used where '?' will be a
    digit starting at 1 and increasing up to a maximum of six depending on depth
    of nesting. Default: number

browser_command:
    Set this to the command needed to launch a browser on your system or leave it blank
    to use your systems default browser.

    If this is an empty string or the browser can not be launched using this command then
    python's `webbrowser` module will be tried. Using a bad command here will slow down the
    launch of the default browser, better to leave it blank.
    Default: empty string

**Configuration**

At present, the file leo/plugins/leo_to_html.ini contains configuration settings. In particular, the default export path, "c:\" must be changed for \*nix systems.

'''Leo''' ('''L'''eonine '''E'''ditor with '''O'''utlines) is a [[text editor]]
that features [[outliner|outlines]] with clones as its central tool of
organization, navigation, customization and scripting.

==Language==

Leo is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Qt
(toolkit)|Qt]]. It is fully scriptable using Python and can be extended with
plugins. In Leo, outlines are hierarchical data structures that people use to
work with and manage text files—including code.

==Trees, clones and views==

Leo is an [[outliner]]. Leo's outline pane shows a [[tree (data structure)]] of data nodes.
Nodes contain headlines, body text, and other information.
Headlines naturally serve as descriptions of the body text.
For example, @file nodes are nodes whose headline starts with @file.

Leo trees are in fact [[directed acyclic graph|directed acyclic graphs]];
nodes may have more than one parent.
Leo calls such nodes clones.
Clones appear in several places in the outline pane.

Views are simply nodes whose children contain clones. A single outline may contain
arbitrarily many views of the nodes contained therein.
Views and clones turn Leo into a supremely flexible filing cabinet: any node may be filed
in arbitrarily many places.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://leoeditor.com/nutshell.html Leo documentation: Leo in a Nutshell]&lt;/ref&gt;

==External files==

@file nodes represent external files, files on the computer's file system.
When saving an outline Leo automatically writes all changed @file
trees back to the external files.
Comments, called sentinel lines, in external files represent the outline structure.
When reading an outline, these comments allows Leo to recreate
@file trees using only the data in the external file.

@auto nodes represent external files without using sentinel comments.
When reading @auto nodes, Leo uses the program structure of the external file
to create the @auto tree.

==Scripting==

Leo's scripting environment takes full advantage of outline structure:

* The body text of any node may contain a Leo script, a Python script executed in the context of a Leo outline.

* A simple [[API]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://leoeditor.com/scripting.html Leo documentation: Scripting Leo with Python]&lt;/ref&gt; gives Leo scripts full access to all data in loaded outlines, as well as full access to Leo's own source code. The API includes Python [[iterators]] that allow scripts to traverse outlines easily.

* Scripts may be composed of any tree of nodes.
  A [[markup language]] similar to [[noweb]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://leoeditor.com/tutorial.html#section-references Leo documentation: Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt; tells Leo how to create scripts from (parts of) an outline.

* Headlines naturally control and guide scripts.

** @test nodes represent unit tests. Leo can execute the body of an @test node as unit test, without the body having to create an explicit subclass of Python's UnitTest.TestCase class. &lt;ref&gt;[

** @button nodes contain scripts that can be applied to other nodes.  In effect, @button nodes create user-defined commands. &lt;ref&gt;

<t tx="ekr.20110521135104.18151">Cross-file clones are cloned nodes in one outline that refer to data in another outline. This is a frequently requested feature. For example::

    I would absolutely love to have the leo files in different project
    directories, and a "master" leo file to rule them all.

However, cross-file clones will never be a part of Leo. Indeed, cross-file clones would violate the principle that data should be defined and managed in exactly one place. Just as human managers would not willingly accept shared responsibility for even a single line of code, every piece of Leonine data should be the responsibility of one and *only* one .leo file.

The problem is fundamental. If the *same* (cloned) data were "owned" by two different Leo files we would have a classic "multiple update problem" for the data. Each outline could change the data in incompatible ways, and whichever outline changed the data last would "win."

To make such a scheme workable and safe, one would have to devise a scheme that would keep the data in "component" .leo files consistent even when the component .leo files changed "randomly", without the "master" .leo file being in *any* way in "control" of the changes. Good luck :-)

Let us be clear: it's no good having a scheme that works *most* of the time, it must work *all* the time, even with unexpected or even pathological file updates. If it doesn't you are asking for, and will eventually get, catastrophic data loss, without being aware of the loss for an arbitrarily long period of time. Even with a source code control system this would be an intolerable situation.

<t tx="ekr.20110531155858.20559">.. _`This FAQ entry`: FAQ.html#how-can-i-use-leo-to-develop-leo-itself

Here is the workflow I use to develop Leo. The intention is to help present and potential developers use Leo effectively.

Overview:

- Develop in an outline containing all of Leo's source files. Close this outline rarely: this keeps the code I am using stable while I'm hacking the code.

- Test in a *separate, private* .leo file, say ~/test.leo.

On Windows I use the following *common* @button node, defined in the @buttons tree in myLeoSettings.leo::

    @button load-test @key=F5
    
    import os
    os.system("start  cmd /c t")
    
Now F5 runs t.bat in a separate console. Leo remains responsive. t.bat opens the test file. t.bat ends with the Windows "exit" command, so the console closes when I close Leo.

Additional tips:

A. Avoid using the mouse whenever possible. For example, use alt-tab to switch between windows.

B. Always develop Leo in a console. This allows you to see the output of g.trace.

Speaking of g.trace, I hardly ever use 'print' because g.trace prints the name of the function or method in which it appears. The typical pattern for enabling traces is::

    trace = True and not g.unitTesting
    if trace: g.trace(whatever)

This pattern is especially useful when a method contains multiple calls to g.trace.

C. I use scripts to open particular Leo files. These are batch files on Windows, and aliases on Linux, but invoking them is the same on either platform::

    all:     opens all my main development files using the qt-tabs gui.
    t:       opens test.leo.
    e:       opens ekr.leo.  I use this file for private testing.
    d:       opens LeoDocs.leo.
    s:       opens LeoPy.leo.
    plugins: opens leoPlugins.leo.
    gui:     opens leoGui.leo.
    u:       opens unitTest.leo.

These run Leo with Python 3.x. There are similar scripts, ending in 2, that run Leo with Python 2.x. For example, u2 opens unitTest.leo with Python 2.x. Thus, to run a test, I alt-tab to an available console window, then type 'e' or 't' or 'u' or, if I want Python 2.x, 'e2' or 't2' or 'u2'.

D. Use clones to focus attention on the task at hand. For more details, see the tutorial's introduction to `clones`_.

E. For thousand of example of my programming style, see leoPy.leo and leoGuiPlugins.leo. The projects section in leoPy.leo contains many examples of using clones to create view nodes. I typically delete the clones in the views shortly before a release.

Writing documentation:

- Use postings as pre-writing for documentation. I don't mind blabbing on and on about Leo because all my posts become pre-writing for Leo's documentation. I simply copy posts to nodes in the "documentation to-do" section. At release time, I edit these nodes and put them in Leo's main documentation or the release notes. This posting is an example.
  
- Use the vr command to debug reStructuredText documentation. The viewrendered pane updates as you type. This makes Leo a killer app for rST.
   
Administrative tips:

- Never rely on memory. A project like this contains thousands and thousands of details. Everything eventually goes into a Leo node somewhere. If it doesn't it surely *will* be forgotten.

- Do easy items first. This keeps to-do lists short, which keeps energy high.

    else:
        # Create an invisible frame.

<t tx="ekr.20110612104631.16414">The following options allow you to expand noweb section references, much like Leo itself does. The rst3 command ensures that unbounded expansions can not happen. While expanding any section, the rst3 will not expand again any sections that have already occurred in the expansion.

``expand_noweb_references``
   True: Replace references by definitions. Definitions must be descendants of the referencing node.

``ignore_noweb_definitions``
    True: ignore section definition nodes.

``expand_noweb_recursively``
    True: recursively expand definitions by expanding any references found in definitions.
        
**Note**: This is an experimental feature: all aspects might changed. The defaults for all these options ensure that the rst3 command works as it has always.

Downloading Leo
###############

There are four ways to download Leo:

- **New**: Leo 5.7 final will have a `Python wheel`_, so ``pip install leo`` will automatically download *and* install Leo, including all Leo's dependencies. See `Installing Leo with pip`_.

- We recommend installing Leo using `git`_, see `Installing Leo with git`_. Git gives you the latest, thoroughly tested code. All of Leo's developers use git.

- If you prefer a new development version, or a version from from 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 or 90 days ago, download a `Nightly snapshot`_.

Q. When I run the following script I see a window appear and then immediately disappear::

    from PyQt4 import QtGui
    w = QtGui.QWidget()
    w.resize(250, 150)
    w.move(300, 300)
    w.setWindowTitle('Simple test')
    w.show()
    
What's going on?

A. When the script exits the sole reference to the window, w, ceases to exist, so the window is destroyed (garbage collected). To keep the window open, add the following code as the last line to keep the reference alive::

    g.app.scriptsDict['my-script_w'] = w

This reference will persist until the next time you run the execute-script. If you want something even more permanent, you can do something like::

    g.app.my_script_w = w

1. Archive and remove the previous version of Leo.
2. Download the nightly snapshot zip file.
3. Unzip it into the same place as the previous version.
4. Enjoy your up-to-date Leo code...

To make this work, it's important to keep your folder containing Leo separate from your .mySettings.leo and any data files.

.. _`raw-data`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#raw-data-pass-through

When using LaTeX and BibTeX, I would like to use inside of Leo a kind of LaTeX-inline-markup, that after generation of the RsT file through Sphinx as well as after running of "make latex", generate a LaTeX file containing the citation call of the form \cite{CITBook001} as described in a file \*.bib. Is there a way to have Leo/Sphinx/RsT generate the inline raw latex syntax?

Use the docutils `raw-data`_ syntax. Examples::

    .. role:: raw-role(raw)
      :format: html latex
    .. raw:: latex
      \bibliographystyle{acm}
      \bibliography{myBibliography}

<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.15152">Some people seem to think that it is difficult to understand how Leo handles "clone wars": differing values for a cloned nodes that appear in several external files. That's not true. The rule is::

    **The last clone that Leo reads wins.**

That is, for any cloned node C, Leo takes the value of C.h and C.b to be the values specified by the last copy that Leo reads.

There is only one complication::

    **Leo reads the entire outline before reading any external files.**

Thus, if C appears in x.leo, y.py and z.py, Leo will choose the value for C in x.py or y.py, depending on which @&lt;file&gt; node appears later in the outline.

**Note**: Whenever Leo detects multiple values for C when opening an outline, Leo creates a "Recovered nodes" tree. This tree contains all the various values for C, nicely formatted so that it is easy to determine where the differences are.

<t tx="ekr.20120319170934.6109">Leo checks that the URL is valid before attempting to open it. A valid URL is:

-   3 or more lowercase alphas
-   followed by one :
-   followed by one or more of:
-   ``$%&amp;'()*+,-./0-9:=?@A-Z_a-z{}~``
-   followed by one of: ``$%&amp;'()*+/0-9:=?@A-Z_a-z}~`` 

That is, a comma, hyphen and open curly brace may not be the last character.

URL's in Leo should contain no spaces: use %20 to indicate spaces.

You may use any type of URL that your browser supports: http, mailto, ftp, file, etc.

Whatever the method used, the import process has the potential to change many files. Usually, I just change @auto and @file to @@auto or @@file, so that any changes I make while studying the code won't affect the originals.

But this "safety first" approach means that I can't actually use Leo to insert tracing statements (or for any other changes.) Happily, there is a way to import "live" code into Leo safely::

   Create a git repository for the code before importing it

The Aha is to create the repository *wherever the code is*, including,
say, python/Lib/site-packages.

- git diff ensures that import hasn't significantly altered the code,

This is exactly what I need:  I can make changes to important tools *safely* within Leo.

<t tx="ekr.20130815102041.15628">By Ville M. Vainio
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mylyn

I went on to start a "leo mylyn" plugin to exercise using the childrenModified and contentModified signals.

If you want to play with it, enable leomylyn.py, modify stuff around the tree and do alt-x mylyn-scores.

Of course as it is useless in this state, but becomes useful when it has a proper gui (maybe in Nav pane), where you would then have a list of "most interesting" nodes.

In the future, this could be able to remember the scores through the sessions, degrade the old scores by time, etc. Also, a scoreset would be associated with a "project" (e.g."own research", "work project foo"), each of them having their own typical node working set.

Mylyn was a nice boost back in the eclipse days, it could work for Leo too. My main motivation right now was to demonstrate the signals with something that is much simpler than using them in qmlnotebook.

screen_capture now captures an image immediately, screen_capture_5sec waits
five seconds, so you can position the pointer, open menus etc. The only
feedback is in the console, as messages in the log would be distracting in
the captured image.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130815102041.15631">Screencasts promise to be easy to be *much* easier to create than slideshows, while also being more interesting, informative and flashy.  It is *so* much easier to write a screencast script than it is to lay out a slide, take a screenshot, and then manage resulting slide.

In particular, there are few continuity problems with screencasts. Continuity is a *huge* problem with slideshows!  If I change one slide, I am likely to want to change all following slides.  Which means I have to retake all the slides, and file the new versions in the proper places.  In contrast, any changes to screencasts naturally propagate forward.  There might be an effect on following screencasts scenes, but this will happen rarely with a reasonable scene design, and any problems should be easy to fix.

With screencasts, the *movie* script is also the *python* script!  There is no "translation" from one to the other.  Furthermore, all the work to produce a screencast is done (naturally!) within Leo.  No need to create and manage external data.  This is another huge advantage and it make producing screencasts much faster than producing slideshows.

Screencasts may be the long-awaited tools that will allow me to show Leo in action so that other will finally be able to understand it easily.

<t tx="ekr.20131001045038.17448">This idea got started when I (Ville M. Vainio) saw this post by Edward Ream on IPython developer mailing list: http://lists.ipython.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2008-January/003551.html

I was using FreeMind as mind mapping software, and so I had an immediate use case for Leo (which, incidentally, is superior to FreeMind as mind mapper). The wheels started rolling, I got obsessed with the power of this concept (everything clicked together), and Edwards excitement paralleled mine. Everything was mind-bogglingly easy/trivial, something that is typical of all promising technologies.

The goal of close cooperation between Leo and IPython went from vague dream to completed reality over the span of about 10 days. The IPython bridge has continued to evolve since then.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001045038.18979">.. _`IPython Notebook`: http://projects.scipy.org/ipython/ipython/wiki/NoteBook

The IPython bridge turns Leo into another kind of `IPython Notebook`_. IPython users typically use %edit to produce non-trivial functions/classes instead of entering them directly on the interactive prompt. But this is a bit clumsy. With Leo, *every Leo node works like an IPython %edit file*:

- You can execute any Leo node in IPython with ipython-exec.
- Saving your Leo outline saves all your IPython scripts.
- You can use Leo as always to organize all your IPython scripts.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001045038.18980">*You can run any IPython script from Leo*. Leo's ipython-exec command executes the body text of the presently selected Leo node in the address space of the IPython shell. Such scripts *immediately* affect the IPython interpreter.

The IPython bridge sets several global variables *within Leo*, allowing Leo scripts *complete* access to all of IPython's code and data:

- g.app.ipk is a *singleton* instance of the InternalIPKernel class,
  defined in leoIPython.py.
- g.app.ipk.namespace is IPython's namespace.
- g.app.ipk.kernelApp is an IPython IPKernelApp object.
- g.app.ipk.kernelApp.shell is an IPython InteractiveShell object.
  Depending on your installation, this may be a ZMQInteractiveShell.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001045038.18981">*You can run any Leo script from IPython*. The IPython bridge injects an object called _leo into IPython's namespace. IPython scripts may access Leo's c and g objects as follows::

    c,g = _leo.c, _leo.g

This allows IPython scripts to do *anything* that a Leo script can do. Scripts run from IPython *immediately* change Leo, *exactly* as if the script were run from Leo.

**Important**: the _leo object is an instance of LeoNameSpace class, defined in leo.core.leoIPython.py. This class allows IPython scripts to access multiple Leo outlines at once. See the actual code for details.

**Note**: _leo.c is a property which can return None in some situations. Here is its definition:

.. code-block:: python

    def __get_c(self):
        '''Return the designated commander, or the only open commander.'''
        self.update()
        if self.commander and self.commander in self.commanders_list:
            return self.commander
        elif len(self.commanders_list) == 1:
            return self.commanders_list[0]
        else:
            return None
    
    def __set_c(self,c):
        '''Designate the commander to be returned by the getter.'''
        self.update()
        if c in self.commanders_list:
            self.commander = c
        else:
            g.trace(g.callers())
            raise ValueError(c)
    
    c = property(
        __get_c, __set_c,
        doc = "LeoNameSpace c property")
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001100236.15927">Leo's valuespace.py plugin uses the ipython namespace when the ``--ipython`` command line switch is in effect.

This plugin provides a "workbook" like way to get data from Leo document to the namespace, and do calculations based on that data. Having this data be accessible to the ipython instance makes it convenient to interact and poke around with the same data.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131001100335.15938">This section explains how to use Leo's standard search/replace commands.
**Note**: you can also use the Nav Tab (in the Log pane) to search for text.

``Ctrl-F (start-search)`` shows the Find Tab and puts the focus in the text box labeled ``Find:``.

**Aside**: You can select radio buttons and toggle check boxes in the Find Tab with ``Ctrl-Alt keys``. The capitalized words of the radio buttons or check boxes indicate which key to use.  For example, ``Ctrl-Alt-X (toggle-find-regex-option)`` toggles the ``regeXp`` checkbox.

After typing ``Ctrl-F``, type the search string, say ``def``, in the text box.

Start the find command by typing ``&lt;Return&gt;``.

But suppose you want to replace ``def`` with ``foo``, instead of just finding ``def``.

Just type ``&lt;Tab&gt;`` before typing ``&lt;Return&gt;``. Focus shifts to the text box labeled ``Replace:``.

Finally, type ``&lt;Return&gt;`` to start the find-next command. When Leo finds the next instance of ``def``, it will select it.

You may now type any command.  The following are most useful:

- ``Ctrl-minus (replace-then-find)`` replaces the selected text.
- ``F3 (find-next)`` continues searching without making a replacement.
- ``F2 (find-previous)`` continues the search in reverse.
- ``Ctrl-G (keyboard-quit)`` ends the search.

Leo uses outlines for just about *everything*, including configuring Leo:

- **leo/config/leoSettings.leo** contains Leo's default **global settings**. Don't change this file unless you are one of Leo's developers.
   
- **~/myLeoSettings.leo** contains your **personal settings**. Leo will not create this file automatically: you should create it yourself. Settings in myLeoSettings.leo override (or add to) the default settings in leoSettings.leo.
   
- Any other .leo file may also contain **local settings**. Local settings apply only to that file and override all other settings.

**Settings nodes** specify settings.  These nodes *must* be descendants of an **@settings** node. Moving a settings node out from the @settings tree disables the setting.

<t tx="ekr.20131001100335.15946">Leo’s minibuffer appears at the bottom of Leo’s main window. You use the minibuffer to execute commands by name, and also to accumulate arguments to commands.

Every Leo command has a **command name**. In this document, keystrokes that invoke a command will be followed by the command name in parentheses. For example, ``Ctrl-S (save-file)`` saves a Leo file.

**Very Important**: Leo has hundreds of commands, but because of tab completion you do not have to remember, or even *know about* any of them.  Feel free to ignore commands that you don't use. The following prefixes help find commands by name:: 

    clone-find  clone-find commands
    file-       file commands
    find-       find commands
    isearch-    incremental search commands
    leo-        open .leo files

    print-      print commands
    rectangle-  rectangle commands
    sort-       sort commands
    toggle-     toggle settings commands
    
Here are the commands that pertain to executing commands:

``Alt-X (full-command)``
    Executes any other command by typing its full name.
    
``Ctrl-P (repeat-complex-command``
    Repeats the last command entered by name in the minibuffer.
    
When in the minibuffer, the following keys are treated in special ways:

``&lt;Return&gt;``
    Executes the command.

``&lt;Tab&gt;``
    Shows all valid completions.

``&lt;BackSpace&gt;``
    Shows more completions.
    
``Ctrl-G``
    Exits the minibuffer and puts focus in the body pane.
    
``UpArrow``
    Moves backward through command history. The first ``UpArrow`` is the same as ``Ctrl-P``.

``DownArrow``
    Moves forward through command history.

``F11 (help-for-command)``
    Shows the documentation for any Leo command. ``F11`` prompts for the name of a Leo command in the minibuffer. Use tab completion to see the list of all commands that start with a given prefix.
``F12 (help-for-python)``
    Shows the documentation from Python's help system. Typing completion is not available: type the full name of any Python module, class, function or statement.

These commands clarify which settings are in effect, and where they came from::

Leo's main window consists of an **icon area** just below the menus, an **outline pane** at the top left, a **log pane** at the top right, a **body pane** at the bottom left, and an optional **viewrendered pane** at the bottom right. The **minibuffer** and **status line** lie at the bottom of the main window.

The log pane contains several tabs. The **Log tab** shows messages from Leo, the **Find Tab** shows the status of Leo's Find/Replace commands. Other tabs may also appear in the log pane: The **Spell Tab** controls Leo's spell-checking. The **Completion Tab** shows available typing completions.

.. index::
    pair: Icon box; Tutorial
    pair: Node; Tutorial

Leo stores all data in **nodes**. Nodes have **headlines**, shown in the outline pane, and **body text**. The body pane shows the body text of the **presently selected node**, the node whose headline is selected in the outline pane.  Headlines have an **icon box** indicating a nodes status. For example, the icon box has a black border when the node has been changed. 

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131002055813.19036">You may select, expand and contract outline nodes with the mouse as usual, but using arrow keys is *highly recommended*. When focus is in the outline pane, *plain* arrows keys change the selected node:

``Right-arrow (expand-and-go-right)``
    Expands a node or selects its first child.
``Left-arrow (contract-or-go-left)``
    Contracts a node if its children are visible, and selects the node's parent otherwise.
``Up-arrow (goto-prev-visible)``
    Selects the previous *visible* outline node.
``Down-arrow (goto-next-visible)``
    Selects the next *visible* outline node.
  
Regardless of focus, ``Alt-arrow`` select outline nodes:

``Alt-Home (goto-first-visible-node)``
    Selects the first outline node and collapses all nodes.
``Alt-End (goto-last-visible-node)``
    Selects the last *visible* outline node and collapses all nodes except the node and its ancestors.
``Alt-arrow keys``
    Select the outline pane, and then act just like the plain arrow keys when the outline pane has focus.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131002055813.19037">When focus is in any of Leo's text panes (body pane, log pane, headlines), Leo works like most text editors:

- ``Plain arrow`` keys move the cursor up, down, left or right.
- ``Ctrl-LeftArrow`` and ``Ctrl-RightArrow`` move the cursor by words.
- ``Home`` and ``End`` move the cursor to the beginning or end of a line.
- ``Ctrl-Home`` moves the cursor to the beginning of the body text.
- ``Ctrl-End`` moves the cursor to the end of the body text.
- ``PageDown`` and ``PageUp`` move the cursor up or down one page.

**Note**: As usual, adding the ``Shift`` key modifier to any of the keys above moves the cursor and extends the selected text.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131002055813.19835">``Ctrl-I or Insert (insert-node)``
    Inserts a new node into the outline.
``Ctrl-H (edit-headline)``
    Begins editing the headline of the selected node.
``Return``
    When focus is in the outline pane, ``&lt;Return&gt;`` ends editing ``(end-edit-headline)`` or switches focus to the body pane.
``Ctrl-Shift-C (copy-node)``
    Copies the outline and all it's descendants, placing the node on the clipboard.
``Ctrl-Shift-X (cut-node)``
    Cuts the outline and all its descendants, placing the node on the clipboard.
``Ctrl-Shift-V (paste-node)``
    Pastes a node (and its descendants) from the clipboard after the presently selected node.
``Ctrl-M (mark)``
    Toggles the mark on a node. Marked nodes have a vertical red bar in their icon area.
``Ctrl-} (demote)``
    Makes all following siblings of a node children of the node. Use ``demote`` to "gather" nodes so they can all be moved with their parent.
``Ctrl-{ (promote)``
    Makes all the children of a node siblings of the node. Use ``demote`` to "scatter" the nodes after moving their parent.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131002055813.19837">Leo has unlimited undo--Leo remembers *all* changes you make to outline structure or the contents of any node since you restarted Leo.

``Ctrl-Z (undo)``
    Undoes the last change. Another Ctrl-Z undoes the previous change, etc.
``Ctrl-Shift-Z (redo)``
    Undoes the effect of the last undo, etc.

The first two entries of the ``Edit`` menu show what the next undo or redo operation will be.

Leo **directives** control Leo's operations. Directives start with ``@`` in the leftmost column of body text. Directives **apply to descendants** until overridden in descendant nodes.

.. index::
    pair: @color; Tutorial
    pair: @nocolor; Tutorial
    pair: @nocolor-node; Tutorial

The **@color**, **nocolor** and **nocolor-node** directives control syntax coloring. **Note**: Nodes containing multiple color directives do *not* affect coloring of descendant nodes::

    @color

.. index::
    pair: @pagewidth; Tutorial
    pair: @tabwidth; Tutorial
    pair: Negative tab width; Tutorial

The **@pagewidth** directive set page width (used when formatting paragraphs). The **@tabwidth** directive controls tabbing. Negative tab widths (recommended for Python) convert tabs to spaces::

    @pagewidth 100
    @tabwidth -4
    @tabwidth 8

    pair: Clone; Tutorial
    
A **clone** is a node that appears in more than one place in a Leo outline. Clones are marked with a small red arrow in its icon box. All clones of a node are actually *the same node*:

- Any change to one clone affects all clones.
- Inserting, moving or deleting any child of a clone will change all other clones on the screen.

Clones allow data to be stored in multiple places within an outline.

``Ctrl-` (clone-node)``
    Clones node A. The shortcut is a grave accent, *not* a single quote.  This is often on the same keyboard key as the tilde ``~`` character.

Please take a few moments to experiment with clones:

- Create a node whose headline is A.
- Clone node A with the ``clone-node`` command.
- Type some text into the body of A.
- All clones of A now have the same body.
- Insert a node, say B, as a child of any of the A nodes.
- Notice that *all* the A nodes now have a B child.
- See what happens if you clone B.
- See what happens if you insert, delete or move nodes that are children of A.
- When you delete a node's penultimate clone, the node becomes a regular node again.

``Ctrl-S (save-file)``
    Saves the outline.
``Ctrl-Q (exit-leo)``
    Exits Leo.  Leo will prompt you to save any unsaved outlines.
    
A **session** specifies a list of tabs (.leo files) that Leo opens automatically when Leo first starts. When the ``--session-save`` and ``--session-restore`` command-line options are in effect, Leo will save session data on exit and will reload outlines when Leo restarts.

<t tx="ekr.20131005214621.16128">- The rst3 command converts an @rst tree to an output file and an intermediate file.

- docutils uses the output file; sphinx uses the intermediate file.

- Settings starting with "rst3" control how the rst3 command works.

- Within @rst trees, headlines become rST sections.

- Sections levels in the generated rST correspond to outline levels in Leo.

- You reorganize your rST documents just by reorganizing the corresponding @rst tree.
  
- The rst3 command works acts on the nearest ancestor @rst node, if any, or on all descendant @rst nodes.
  
- @rst-no-head nodes insert text (or markup) without an rST headline.

- The rst3 command ignores @rst-ignore nodes and @rst-ignore-tree trees.

- The @button make-sphinx node in LeoDocs.leo calls sphinx automatically.

- CheatSheet.leo contains an expanded version of the example used in this tutorial. |br|
  You can open CheatSheet.leo from Leo's help menu.

<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16053">A plugin is a Python file in Leo's plugins folder.

Every plugin should have a top-level init function that returns True if the plugin has been initialized properly. The init function typically:

1. Registers an onCreate event handler, called when Leo creates a new window.
2. Calls g.plugin_signon(__name__)

For example::

    def init():
        if &lt;&lt; all imports successful &gt;&gt;:
            g.registerHandler('after-create-leo-frame',onCreate)
            g.plugin_signon(__name__)
            return True
        else:
            return False
   
Plugins do *not* have automatic access to c, g and p.

Plugins define g by importing it::

    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g
    
Plugins gain access to c using event handlers::

    controllers = {}
    
    def init():
        g.registerHandler('after-create-leo-frame',onCreate)
        return True
        
    def onCreate (tag, keys):
        global controllers
        c = keys.get('c')
        if c:
            hash = c.hash()
            if hash not in controllers.keys():
                controllers(hash) = PluginController(c)
            
    def eventHander(tag,keys):
        global controllers
        c = keys.get('c')
        if c:
            controller = controllers.get(c.hash())
            controller.handleEvent()
            
Some plugins inject ivars into the Commands class rather than using a global controllers dict::

    def onCreate (tag, keys):
        c = keys.get('c')
        if c:
            c.my_plugin_controller = ControllerClass(c)
            
    def eventHander(tag,keys):
        c = keys.get('c')
        if c:

<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16066">Clones are nodes appearing multiple places in the outline.

- Changes to one clone affect all other clones.
- All clones of a node are *exactly the same node*.

Views allow multiple views of data to exist in a single outline.

- A view is simply a collection of nodes.
- Because of clones, a node may appear in many views at once.
- View focus attention on tasks and reduce searching for nodes.

Leo expands abbreviations as you type.

- Abbreviations range from simple shortcuts to multi-line templates containing fields.
- Type ``,,`` to move to the next field.
- Abbreviations can also insert the result of executing code.

.. index:: Running Leo

This chapter tells how to run Leo and discusses Leo's command-line options.

.. contents:: Contents
    :depth: 3

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16151">You can run Leo from a Python interpreter as follows::

    import leo
    leo.run() # runs Leo, opening a new outline or,
    leo.run(fileName=aFileName) # runs Leo, opening the given file name.

Another way to run Leo is as follows::

    cd &lt;path-to-launchLeo.py&gt;
    python launchLeo.py %*

Here are some tips that may make running Leo easier:

**Linux**
    
The following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo::

    #!/bin/sh 
    python &lt;leopath&gt;launchLeo.py $1

where &lt;leopath&gt; is the path to the directory containing the leo directory. 

**Windows**

You can associate Leo with .leo files using a batch file. Put the
following .bat file in c:\\Windows::

    &lt;path-to-python&gt;/python &lt;path-to-leo&gt;/launchLeo.py %*

Here &lt;path-to-leo&gt; is the path to the directory *containing* the leo directory,
that is, the directory containing launchLeo.py.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16152">The first time you start Leo, a dialog will ask you for a unique identifier. If
you are using a source code control system such as git, use your git login name.
Otherwise your initials will do.

Leo stores this identifier in the file .leoID.txt. Leo attempts to create
leoID.txt in the .leo sub-directory of your home directory, then in Leo's config
directory, and finally in Leo's core directory. You can change this identifier
at any time by editing .leoID.txt.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16153" rst_http_attribute="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">On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form::

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.
Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of
that file using Leo's Execute Script command. By default, Leo sends all
output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable
this output by calling app.log.disable or app.log.enable

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body
and Edit Headline commands. Those commands require interaction with the user.
For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the
headlines in that file::

    path = r"&lt;path-to-folder-containing-the-leo-folder&gt;\\leo\\test\\test.leo"

    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

    for p in newFrame.c.all_positions():
        g.es(g.toEncodedString(p.h,"utf-8"))
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16154">.. _`associating .leo files with python.exe`: installing.html#creating-windows-file-associations

Leo sends more detailed error messages to stderr,
the output stream that goes to the console window. In Linux and MacOS
environments, python programs normally execute with the console window visible.

On Windows, you can run Leo with the console window visible by `associating .leo files with python.exe`_ *not* pythonw.exe.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16155">Leo uses os.expanduser('~') to determine the HOME directory if no HOME environment variable exists.

Leo puts several files in your HOME/.leo directory: .leoID.txt, .leoRecentFiles.txt, and myLeoSettings.leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131008041326.16156">Leo supports the following command-line options. As usual, you can see the list by typing the following in a console window::

    leo -h

or::

    leo --help

You will get something like the following::

    Usage: launchLeo.py [options] file1, file2, ...

Using Leo as a Personal Information Manager

..  "Cloning is pure genius!"---Michael Manti

..  "If you are like me, you have a kind of knowledge base with infos
..  gathered over time. And you have projects, where you use some of those
..  infos. Now, with conventional outliners you begin to double these
..  infos, because you want to have the infos needed for the project with
..  your project. With Leo you can do this too, but if you change text in
..  one place **it is updated in the other place too!** This is a feature I
..  did not see with any other outliner (and I tried a few). Amazing! Leo
..  directly supports the way I work!"---F. Geiger

This chapter tells how you can use Leo as a Personal Information Manager. It introduces `clones`_: one of Leo's most unusual and powerful features for organizing data.

Leo's rst3 command converts Leo trees containing `reStructuredText`_ (rST) or `Sphinx`_ markup to HTML, PDF, `LaTeX`_ and other kinds of output files. This tutorial gives step-by-step instructions for using the rst3 command.

**Prerequisites**: Please make sure you have read the `first tutorial`_ before reading this one. If you are new to rST, please read the `rST primer`_. For full information about Sphinx, please read the `Sphinx documentation`_.

The rst3 command makes using rST or Sphinx *much* easier by automatically creating underlining for rST sections. To reorganize a document, just reorganize the corresponding Leo outline: you don't have to change underlining characters by hand.

The tutorial covers only the basic features of the rst3 command. This is enough to generate all of Leo's documentation!

CheatSheet.leo contains an expanded version of the example used in this tutorial. You can open CheatSheet.leo from Leo's help menu.

This chapter is for anyone who wants to understand Leo's code base,
including those who want to be one of Leo's implementors.

You already know that leoFind.py and leoUndo.py implement Leo's find and
undo command, and so on.

This chapter focuses on the *process* of finding your way around Leo's
code, not the myriad details you will find within Leo's code.

It's actually very easy! Try it. You'll see.

Leo highlights URLs whenever syntax is coloring is enabled.

``Ctrl-Left-Click (open-url-under-cursor)``
    Opens the URL under the cursor.
``open-url``
    Opens a URL appearing either in the headline or the first line of body text. If a headline starts with ``@url``, the rest of the headline is take to be a url.
    
**Note**:

- Leo opens URLs that look like file names using os.startfile.
- Leo opens all other URLs with your default web browser.
- Any scheme (http, mailto, ftp, file, etc.) supported by your browser is valid.
- URL's should contain no spaces: use ``%20`` instead of spaces.

`See the Appendix &lt;appendices.html#valid-url-s&gt;`_ for a complete description of valid URLs.

    pair: @rst Node; Tutorial
    
1. Create a node someplace in your outline.

2. Type this in the headline::

        @rst myDocument.html
        
The @rst node, and all its descendants, represents your document.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16750">Put something like this in the body of the @rst node::

    #############
    War and Peace
    #############
    
rST markup uses over/underlining to indicate chapter titles. Put a **overline** consisting of pounds signs above the title (War and Peace), and an identical **underline** of pound signs below as shown. rST markup for chapter titles is a bit picky:

- under/overlines must be at least 4 characters long
- under/overlines must be at least as long as the title.
- The overline and underline must be identical.

In addition, the rst3 command requires that the "#" character be used in the over/underlines for chapter titles.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16751">Now you write your novel, short story, documentation or whatever. Organize your work as always:

| **nodes create sections, subsections, sub-sub-sections, etc.**
| **depending on their position in the outline**.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16752">.. index::
    pair: rst3 Command; Tutorial

``&lt;Alt-X&gt;rst3&lt;Return&gt;`` runs the rst3 command.

- If the present node is an @rst node, or a descendant node of an @rst node, the rst3 command applies to the nearest ancestor @rst node.

- Otherwise, the rst3 command applies to all descendant @rst trees.

If @bool rst3_call_docutils is True, the rst3 command will call docutils automatically to create the output files. For more information about Leo settings, see `this section &lt;tutorial-basics.html#configuring-leo&gt;`_.

When using sphinx, run sphinx's "make" utility after running the rst3 command to create the final output files.

**Errors and warnings**:

1. Install docutils and then restart Leo if you see this error::

    writeToDocutils: docutils not present
    
2. ​Leo has a default stylesheet ​​that centers titles and makes them big and bold, so you can disregard messages such as::

    stylesheet not found &lt;path-to&gt;default.css
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16753">You now know enough to get started with the rst3 command. Some possible next steps are:

- Look at Leo's own documentation in LeoDocs.leo. Discover how the nodes in this tree correspond to the documentation you see before you.
   
- LeoDocs.leo has an @button make-sphinx script that calls sphinx automatically.

- Create your own @rst nodes. Run the rst3 command on them and see what happens.

- If you get stuck, please ask for help at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leo-editor.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16754">Put the rst3_call_docutils setting in the @settings tree in the .leo file containing the @rst node. This setting determines whether to use plain rST markup or full sphinx markup. To use plain reStructuredText markup::

    @bool rst3_call_docutils = True
    
To use sphinx markup::

    @bool rst3_call_docutils = False
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131009100732.16755">Sometimes you want to organize text without creating sections:

1. Create an outline node to organize your text.

2. Type the following in the headline::

    @rst-no-head &lt;any text: it is ignored&gt;
    
The rst3 command adds the body text of this node to the previous section:

- The headline is ignored.
- The @rst-no-head node does not change the rST section structure in any way.
</t>

    pair: Abbreviation; Tutorial

Leo optionally expands abbreviations as you type. Abbreviations typically end with something like ``;;`` so they won't trigger by accident.

To use abbreviations, you must enable them in myLeoSettings.leo::

    @bool enable-abbreviations = True

You define abbreviations in ``@data abbreviations`` nodes or ``@data global-abbreviations`` nodes. None come predefined, but ``leo/config/exampleSettings.leo`` contains example abbreviations in the node ``@data abbreviations examples``

Abbreviations can simply be shortcuts::

    ncn;;=@nocolor
    
Abbreviations can span multiple lines. Continued lines start with ``\:``, like this::

    form;;=&lt;form action="main_submit" method="get" accept-charset="utf-8"&gt;
    \:&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Continue &amp;rarr;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    \:&lt;/form&gt;\n

Abbreviations can define templates in which ``&lt;|a-field-name|&gt;`` denotes a field to be filled in::

    input;;=&lt;input type="text/submit/hidden/button"
    \:name="&lt;|name|&gt;"
    \:value="" id="&lt;|id|&gt;"&gt;\n

Typing ``,,`` after inserting a template selects the next field.

Abbreviations can execute **abbreviation scripts**, delimited by ``{|{`` and ``}|}``::

    date;;={|{import time ; x=time.asctime()}|}
    ts;;={|{import time ; x=time.strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")}|}
    
To use abbreviations scripts, enable them in myLeoSettings.leo as follows::

    @bool scripting-abbreviations = True

With abbreviation scripts enabled, typing ``ts;;`` gives::

    20131009171117
    
It's even possible to define a context in which abbreviation scripts execute. See leoSettings.leo for full details.

`Leo plugins &lt;plugins.html&gt;`_ are Python programs that extend what Leo can do. Plugins reside in the leo/plugins folder. **@enabled-plugins** settings node enable plugins. Leo has dozens of plugins, including:

- `bookmarks.py`_ manages and shows bookmarks.
- `contextmenu.py`_ shows a context menu when you right-click a headline.
- `mod_scripting.py`_ supports @button and @command nodes.
- `quicksearch.py`_ Adds Nav tab for searching.
- `todo.py`_ provides to-do list and simple project-management capabilities.
- `valuespace.py`_ adds outline-oriented spreadsheet capabilities.
- `viewrendered.py`_ creates the rendering pane and renders content in it.

<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16815">The LoadManager (LM) class (in leoApp.py) is responsible for initing all objects and settings. This is a complex process. Here is the big picture:

- The LM reads each local (non-settings) file twice. The first load discovers the settings to be used in the second load. This ensures that proper settings are *available* during the second load.

- Ctors init settings "early", before calling the ctors for subsidiary objects. This ensures that proper settings are *in effect* for subsidiary ctors.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16860">Leo uses a model/view/controller architecture.

- Controller: The Commands class and its helpers in leoCommands.py and leoEditCommands.py.

- Model (data): The VNode and Position classes in leoNodes.py.

- View: The gui-independent base classes are in the node "Gui Base Classes". The Qt-Specific subclasses are in the node "Qt gui".

.. _`David Parnas`:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Parnas
.. _`Glenford Myers`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenford_Myers

In Leo, each class hides (encapsulates) the details of its internal workings from user (client) classes. This design principle has been spectacularly successful. Leo's overall design has remained remarkably stable for 20 years, even as the internal details of many classes have radically changed. Two computer scientists influenced my thinking greatly: `David Parnas`_ and `Glenford Myers`_.

The distinction between gui-dependent and gui-independent is important. Almost all gui-dependent code resides in the plugins folder. Leo's core code is almost completely gui independent.

Leo's core typically assumes that w (an abstract widget) is a subclass of the baseTextWidget class. This class implements the DummyHighLevelInterface interface. Actually, w is usually a LeoQTextBrowser or leoQtBaseTextWidget object, defined in qtGui.py. These classes provide thin wrappers for corresponding Qt widgets.

Wrapper classes are useful, regardless of gui independence:

- Wrapper classes often simplify the corresponding code in Leo's code.
- Wrapper classes provide convenient methods for debugging and tracing.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16862">Once you know approximately where to look, it is easy to use traces to
discover what is going on. To trace the last n (default 4) callers of any
function::

    g.trace(g.callers(n))
    
Many complex methods define a trace variable::

    trace = False and not g.unitTesting
    
A good rule of thumb: the more complex a method is, the more useful its
traces are likely to be.

You can also to use g.pdb() to single-step through the code.
I typically use g.pdb() only for deep mysteries!

**Note**: you must run Leo from a console window to use either g.trace or
g.pdb. I recommend always running Leo from a console.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16868">You can learn *anything* about Leo, provided that you can cause Leo to execute the relevant code. That's usually very easy!

- It should be straightforward to isolate the module or modules involved.
- The next several sections give hints about finding interesting code.
- Once you find a bit of interesting code, use g.pdb or g.trace to study it.

The following sections provide more details...
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16870">The following methods and their helpers all have useful traces:

- leoQtEventFilter.eventFilter (qtGui.py) and helpers create keystrokes 
  (LeoKeyEvents) from QKeyEvent events.

- k.masterKeyHandler (leoKeys.py) receives LeoKeyEvents from eventFilter
  and invokes one of Leo's commands based on the users bindings.

- k.getArg handles commands like Ctrl-F (search-with-present-options)
  that prompt the user for input.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16871">c.outerUpdate and helpers eliminate flicker by redrawing the screen only at
the end of each command.

c.outerUpdate contains several sophisticated and useful traces.

qtGui.set_focus (qtGui.py) is the only place that actually explicitly sets
focus in Leo. Enabling a trace there can be useful.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131011050613.16876">The following methods are surprisingly fragile. Change them only after careful thought. Make *sure* to run all unit tests after changing them in any way:

- leoTree.select and c.selectPosition switch nodes.

- c.endEditing ends editing in a headline and updates undo data.

- leoBody.onBodyChanged updates undo data when body text changes.

- baseNativeTree.onHeadChanged (baseNativeTree.py) updates undo data.

  **Note**: This method overrides leoTree.onHeadChanged (leoFrame.py),
  which is not used.

In addition, *all* event handling in baseNativeTree.py is extremely fragile. Don't even think about changing this code unless you know exactly what you are doing.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131012060912.16768">Leo creates commands in two ways:

1. Using the @g.command(command-name) decorator.

2. Using tables, usually getPublicCommands methods in various classes.

For example, to find the code for the sort-lines command, search for
sort-lines. You will find::

    'sort-lines':    self.sortLines,
    
Now search for "def sortLines" and you have arrived.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131012060912.16770">Leo's key handling is complex because it does inherently complex things:

- Code in various places translate user key bindings to dictionaries.

- eventFilter and its helpers translates incoming QKeyEvents to LeoKeyEvents.

- k.masterKeyHandler associates incoming LeoKeyEvents with
  mode-and-pane-dependent bindings.
  
Much of this complexity is a direct result in the flexibility given to users in specifying key bindings.

    pair: Generator; Tutorial

Commanders and positions define several `Python generators &lt;https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators&gt;`_ to traverse (step through) an outline. The `scripting portion`_ of `Leo's cheat sheet`_ lists all of Leo's generators. For example, c.all_positions() traverses the outline in outline order.  The following prints a properly-indented list of all headlines::

    for p in c.all_positions():
        print(' '*p.level()+p.h)

.. index::
    pair: Invalid positions; Tutorial
    
Scripts may capture positions like this::

    aList = list(c.all_positions())
    
**Warning**: stored positions become invalid when outline changes. **c.positionExists(p)** is True if p is valid in c's outline.

**New in Leo 5.5**: All generators now yield *copies* of positions.
    
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131012060912.16788">g.es can send it's output to tabs other than the log tab::

        # Create Test or make it visible.

    g.es('Test',color='blue',tabName='Test')
        # Write to the test tab.

Plugins and scripts may call the c.frame.canvas.createCanvas method to create a log tab containing a graphics widget. Here is an example script::

    log = c.frame.log ; tag = 'my-canvas'
    w = log.canvasDict.get(tag)
    if not w:
        w = log.createCanvas(tag)

A **position** represents an outline node at a *specific position* in the outline. Positions provide methods to insert, delete and move outline nodes. The `scripting portion`_ of `Leo's cheat sheet`_ lists the most important methods of the position class.

Because of clones, the *same* node may appear at *multiple positions* in the outline. A **vnode** represents the node's data, which is shared all positions referring to that node.

.. _`user attributes`: customizing.html#adding-extensible-attributes-to-nodes-and-leo-files

For any position p, **p.b** is the node's body text, **p.h** is the node's headline and **p.u** is the node's `user attributes`_, and **p.v** is the position's vnode. Similarly, for any vnode v, **v.b** is the node's body text, **v.h** is the node's headline and **v.u** is the node's user attributes.

<t tx="ekr.20131016021541.16893">- execute-script predefines c, g and p.
- c is a commander, g is the leoGlobals module, and p is the current position.
- Vnodes contain all outline data.
- Positions provide easy access to vnodes.
- Positions become invalid when outline nodes are inserted, deleted or moved.
- Generators visit all or parts of the outline, in a specified order.

    "Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy."---Joe Orr

Leo is a fundamentally different way of using and organizing data, programs and scripts. Leo has been under active development for 20+ years with an active `group of developers and users`_.

**Leo is:**

- A fully-featured IDE, with many features inspired by `Emacs`_.
- An outliner. Everything in Leo is an outline.
- A data manager, data manager and personal information manager.
- A powerful scripting environment.
- A tool for organizing and studying computer code.
- Extensible via a simple plugin architecture.
- A tool that plays well with  IPython, Vim and Emacs.
- Written in 100% pure Python

**Leo's unique features**

Leo *completely integrates* Python scripting and outlines. Simulating the following features in Vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible, just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...

- All commands and scripts have easy access to outline structure via a simple `Python API`_. |br|
  For example, p.b is the body text of the selected outline node. |br|
  Scripts have full access to all of Leo's sources.
- `Clones`_ create multiple views of an outline.  |br|
  Leo's underlying data is a `Directed Acyclic Graphs`_.  |br|
  As a result, Leo organizes data in completely new ways.
- Scripts and programs can be composed from outlines using `outline-oriented directives`_.
- Importers convert flat text into outlines.
- @test and @suite scripts create unit tests automatically.
- @button scripts apply scripts to outline data.

These features combine to create a `Leonine`_ way of programming and
organizing. You won't learn all about Leo in a day or two. `Leo's
tutorial`_ explains the basic features. You can learn more advanced
features later. Please `ask for help`_ immediately if you get stuck.

<t tx="ekr.20131018100353.16706">Clones can greatly accelerate your work flow. To start a project, clone nodes related to the project and drag them at or near the top level, where you can get at them easily. When the project is complete, just delete the clones. This work flow is surprisingly effective:

- The original nodes never move, but they change whenever their clones do.

- There is nothing to "put back in place" when you are done. Just delete the clones.
  
Used this way, **clones create views**: when you gather cloned nodes together for a project, you are, in effect, creating a project-oriented view of the outline. This view **focuses your attention** on only those nodes that are relevant to the task at hand.

The Leonine World
#################

**Leonine** refers to Leo's unique way of organizing data and programs. This has many implications:

**Browsing**: Leo remembers your outline organization. Class browsers don't. Doh!

**The big picture**: Outline nodes hide messy details, revealing the big picture *at all times*.

**Programming**: Leo outlines naturally organize programs into modules, classes and functions. Leonine sources are their own design document. How you organize outlines is a choice in a new design space.

**User-defined types**: Headlines naturally describe a node's contents: **headlines naturally define types**. Leo's core supports types such as @button, @rst, @suite, @url, etc. Plugins define @bookmark, @graph, @html and @task types. Scripts can easily define other types.

**Testing**: Leo's @test nodes creates a unique unit-testing framework:

- @test nodes focus on the real test code.
- It is easy to run only the @test nodes in a particular suboutline.
- @test scripts can easily use data in their children.

.. _`clone-find`: tutorial-basics.html#clone-find-commands

**Work flow**: The `clone-find`_ commands gather all match a pattern under a single node. No need to keep searching for them. You can change the clones, and the original nodes change as well. This is a great way to fix bugs or to write books.

**Databases**: Leo's clones create new opportunities for scriptable databases. In my brother Speed's outlines, suboutlines *are* SQL queries!
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131019061259.16686">execute-script predefines::

    c: The commander of the present outline.
    g: The leo.core.leoGlobals module.

    p.self_and_parents()
    p.self_and_siblings()
    p.following_siblings()

    p.expand()
    p.insertAfter()
    p.insertAsNthChild(n)

    p.moveToNthChildOf(parent,n)
    p.moveToRoot(oldRoot=None)
        # oldRoot **must** be the old root position if it exists.
        
**Moving positions**

The following move positions *themselves*: they change the node to which a
position refers. They do *not* change outline structure in any way! Use
these when generators are not flexible enough::

    p.moveToBack()
    p.moveToFirstChild()
    p.moveToLastChild()
    p.moveToLastNode()
    p.moveToNext()
    p.moveToNodeAfterTree(p2)

<t tx="ekr.20131023151757.17124">"I would never again willingly program without Leo"---Edward K. Ream

From Terry Brown:

    If you're looking for an *environment* which includes a good editor and outliner and is completely scriptable / interactive / "live-code" in Python, then Leo wins hands down. Of course, it's basically alone in this field, as far as I know, but I'm sure it would do well even if it wasn't :-). Take out the Python part, and maybe they're some others out there, but who'd want to take out the Python part :) I guess Emacs is sort of an environment like this, only in Lisp with a prehistoric GUI system.

    Sometimes I've wondered why Leo seems to appeal to people who aren't comfortable in Python, I think now it's because they still recognize the value of an *environment*, and there's just not much in this niche.
    
    My feeling, talking generally and not about Leo in particular, is that while not everyone needs to be a "programmer", everyone who uses computers would benefit from being able to interact with them with more of the flexibility and efficiency that comes with even relatively simple "scripting", and less of the limitations that come with the "buy our latest product and you'll be able to do anything you want with a click" view pushed by other suppliers of computing environments.

From Jacob Peck:

    Leo's impact on my life since I found it in January has been substantial.

    Leo allows me to automate my life to a great extent. It is my to-do list, my personal assistant, my address book, my password log, my recipe archive, my rss feed reader (due to rss.py), and my favored editor. It partially powers my blog (along with git, ruby, and heroku), allowing me to create a new blog entry with one click and a bit of editing. Viewrendered (with markdown support!) has changed the way I write READMEs and blog posts. On top of all of that, it has allowed to me to organize several disparate tabletop game design projects I have going, as well as my numerous writing projects. Not to mention the impact it has on my ability to understand and decode large python projects!

    But what really cinches all of this for me is how crazy extensible Leo is. Script buttons in particular are an integral part of my daily workflow, allowing me to transform my productivity over the last month...I'm now a thing-getter-doner, and I find much of it is due to the powerful core of Leo, plus scripting.py and todo.py.
    
From Ville M. Vainio:
    
    The outliner format helps me organize/reorganize my thoughts gradually, instead of putting everything in the right place from the beginning. I write a lot of body text with few headlines, and Leo's approach leaves lots of space for the body text and therefore suits my workflow. I find that I end up revisiting notes composed on Leo more often than notes slapped into tools like Evernote or random files in the file system.

    With Leo, I can interleave "notes" (most of the content), generated files and even random data and python scripts to manipulate that data. I process this data in various tools, but Leo helps me group it together in "project specific" Leo files.

    I know how to script the outline, so I can easily whip up different tools for my needs that deal with the headline structure directly.
    
From Terry Brown:

    Why Leo? Because I have two nodes which were originally identical but are now different and I want to see the differences.
    
    My outline loads a @file called ~/.leo/t/gen which contains a @button with several @rclick children for commonly used tasks. I add a new one, @rclick diff::
    
        selected = c.getSelectedPositions()
        open('/tmp/a_diff', 'w').write(selected[0].b)
        open('/tmp/b_diff', 'w').write(selected[1].b)
        import os
        os.system("xxdiff /tmp/a_diff /tmp/b_diff &amp;")
    
    which is horrible for a number of reasons but also took only moments to write. And now, not only does this Leo session have a visual node diff capability, but also every future session which loads ~/.leo/t/gen.
    
    When you can go from wanting to having a feature in less time than it takes to write an email about it - well, that's "why Leo".
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131024051649.17136">Put introductory words in the body of the @rst node itself:

    "Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
    Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,
    if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
    Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more
    to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful
    slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have
    frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news."
    
    It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna
    Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna.
    With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank
    and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna
    Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering
    from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used
    only by the elite.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131024051649.17137">To create a new section, subsection, etc., in the output file:

1. Create a new outline node, as some descendant of the @rst node.

2. **The new node's headline becomes the section's title**.

3. Type the contents of the section in the body text of the node.

That's all there is to it:

- **The rst3 command generates rST underlining automatically**.

- **You reorganize your document by reorganizing nodes**.

There is *no* need to change markup when reorganizing your document, a huge improvement over writing "raw" rST.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131025044901.17144">"Not sure why you said 'you can specify a computer program as an outline like thing in an outliner like setting.' Why not just say, 'write a computer program in an outline?' Is there some nuance I am missing?"---EKR

There are probably a million reasons I said it like that, but I think the main one is my ever present, brightly burning belief that a program should be designed before its coded. Remember those guys, back in the day, who after receiving their programming assignment, would go to the keyboard and start pounding out C code? Remember their finished product? Remember how long it took them to finally complete the project?

Meanwhile, when receiving an assignment, I'd spend hours to days with a bunch of paper, drawing diagrams. By the time I sat down at the terminal, I knew my data structures and algorithms. The hours to days head start of the "start coding immediately" guys evaporated because for me, coding was just a secretarial task, and I was required to do less refactoring, or even worse, kludging. Later, sometimes I'd substitute an outliner for the diagrams on paper; in the days of functional decomposition, an outliner was the perfect fit.

Back to your question: If all I needed to do was **write** a program, I'd just sit down at a computer and start pounding out C or Python or Lua or whatever. But that's not my style. I need to **design** a program, and after all, a design is just a specification of how the program is going to be written.

So it seems to me that I *design* the program on Leo, and then, when the time comes, I flip a switch and Leo *writes* the program for me. That's how I'd view what I've heard about Leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131025044901.17147">It is often useful to put reference material in your @rst tree that will *not* be included in the actual output. To have the rst3 command ignore a single node, type this in the node's headline::

    @rst-ignore &lt;ignored-text&gt;
    
Neither the headline nor body text will be part of the output file.
    
To have the rst3 command ignore a node and all its descendants, type this in the node's headline::

    @rst-ignore-tree &lt;ignored-text&gt;
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131025044901.17148">The `rST manual &lt;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#directives&gt;`_ tells how to insert "raw" markup into the output. For example, Leo's documentation defines the following::
    
    .. |---| unicode:: U+02015 .. for quotes
       :trim:

Now ``---`` inserts ---, the unicode "quotation dash" used to indicate the author of quotations. Note that rST automatically turns ``--`` into a dash: --.

The rST ``|`` markup breaks text into specific lines, but there are times when it can't be used.  The following inserts a line break into text::

    .. |br| raw:: html
    
       &lt;br /&gt;
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131027064821.17144">The rst3 command applied to::

    @rst myDocument.html
    
will generate an **output file**, myDocument.html, from this node and its children, grand-children, etc. The rst3 command creates the output file in the same directory as the .leo file containing the @rst node. You can specify other directories using absolute or relative paths. Examples::

    @rst myDocument.html        # in same folder as the .leo file
    @rst html/myDocument.html   # in a subfolder
    @rst ~/docs/myDocument.html # an absolute path to the folder
    
The rst3 command writes an **intermediate file** in the same directory as the output file. This intermediate file contains the reStructuredText markup generated by the rst3 command. It has the suffix .txt::

    myDocument.html.txt


</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131027064821.18685"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20131027064821.18689">When using sphinx you must ensure that sphinx's conf.py file is configured so that it will find the intermediate files created by the rst3 command. For example, the conf.py file for Leo's docs contains the following::

    source_suffix = '.html.txt'
    
This "matches" the form of the intermediate files.  For example, given::

    @rst myDocument.html
    
and the default value for the rst3_write_intermediate_extension setting::

    @string rst3_write_intermediate_extension = .txt
    
the name of intermediate file will be::

    myDocument.html.txt

myDocument.html.txt is the **input** file for sphinx.

<t tx="ekr.20131115075142.16636">Use .leo files to test settings rather than to contain data. These files would typically contain just an @settings tree, and one or two nodes illustrating their effect. Opening such files limits the effects of experimental/non-standard/risky settings. This is a great tip to know.

For example, the files leo10pt.leo, leo12pt.leo, leo14-12pt.leo and leo14pt.leo in the leo/config folder make it easy to compare different font settings.

As another example, when starting the vim-mode project I created a .leo file containing @bool vim-mode = True. By opening this file I test vim mode without interfering with my normal work flow.

<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16401">Making screencasts is a lot easier than you probably think. Here are some tips to get you started quickly.







</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16402">The primary purpose of this script is to open your app at a fixed, unchanging size. This is surprisingly important:

- It ensures that the window will always render to pixels in the same way.
- It makes it easier to splice in new video to an existing video.
- It makes it easier to plan your video to ensure everything will appear as you expect.
- It provides continuity when making a series of videos.

Here is a script that I use when making Leo's screencasts::

    python launchLeo.py --no-cache --gui=qttabs
    --window-size=682x1264 &lt;list of .leo files&gt; %*​
    
This *particular* --window-size causes Camtasia to create a window whose actual size is 720x1280, the nominal 720p resolution. It may prevent text blur. Or not. I do know that Leo's screencasts look great at 720p.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16403">Make sure that you can actually upload *excellent quality* videos before doing anything else. This step is crucial. If you skip this step, all of your initial recording an post-production work could be utterly wasted.

Use *short* (10-second) test videos at this step. Their primary purpose verify that you can can get to the *end* of the production process successfully. You *are* going to make lots of mistakes here: using short videos helps you make these mistakes quickly.

Don't even *think* about making longer videos until the answers to all the following questions are clearly "yes":

- Is your camera working?
- Is your microphone working?
- Do you know how to record your voice and screen?
- Can you log into YouTube or screencast.com?
- Can you upload to YouTube or screencast.com?
- Is the sound in your *uploaded* video great?
- Do the pixels in your *uploaded* look great?

This last item is particularly important. Just because pixels look good in your video editor is no guarantee that they will look good when uploaded.

You are ready to try your first "real" take *only* when you can upload a video that looks and sounds great.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16404">Before rushing right out and making your first video, I recommend watching the tutorial screencasts at screencast.com: http://www.techsmith.com/tutorial-camtasia-8.html

Watch the tutorials to see how the presentations themselves are organized. Watch them until it feels natural to emulate their style.

If you will be using Camtasia, you will also want to watch the tutorials to learn how Camtasia works.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16405">Now it's time to go beyond test videos. Even now, though, I recommend keeping your first efforts short: one minute or so. Again, this saves time. You'll ending up throwing away two or three anyway ;-)

Bring up your app using you demo script and run through your presentation.

Here's the **most important tip**: As you narrate your video, audio flubs are inevitable, but they don't matter at all *provided* that you *realize* that you have just flubbed a word or phrase.

When you flub a line, don't panic! Just *pause*, regroup, and repeat the phrase until you get it right. *Pausing is essential*: it simplifies inserting and deleting sound bites during post production.

You'll relax once you realize that flubs don't matter and that pausing makes post-production easier. Once you relax, getting a good take will suddenly become easier.

Correcting flubs *as soon as they happen* is absolutely essential. Don't even *think* about fixing audio flubs in post-production. It simply can't be done. Instead of spending 20 minutes trying (and failing) to correct a flub in post production, it is much faster and better to take 20 seconds during your take to correct the flub.

Similar remarks apply to video, but in my experience it's much easier to get the video right. If you do flub the video, it will be much easier if you just do a complete retake. With Camtasia, you can separate the audio and video tracks, but usually that won't work, especially if there is audio of key clicks.

By retaking audio flubs as they happen, I find it easy to work without a script. It feels more natural to me than reading a script. YMMV. When I get stuck, I just pause. Or just start over. Otoh, it wouldn't be that hard to read a script. Just *pause* before and after each phrase. Never rush your audio!

In short, the key Aha is: insert (audio) pauses *everywhere* as needed. It's easy to edit them out. It's virtually impossible to edit in the middle of words, even with the world's best audio editor.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16406">Post production should be easy provided that you have corrected all audio flubs as they happen. This keeps the audio and video in sync. Just edit out flubs and reduce overly-long pauses.

I won't discuss production details here because they depend on the editor you are using.

Do a new take if you don't have clean audio. Depending on the complexity of your video, it may be possible to splice a partial take in the middle or end of your video. Similarly, it may be possible to splice in a new take to add material you didn't cover in your first take.

One final word of advice. When editing your video, settle for "good enough". Perfectionism is not your friend.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131122055946.16407">Making a screencast is a lot easier than you think :-)

- Create a script that will open your app at a fixed, optimal, size.

- Emulate the style and form of screencast.com tutorials.

- Verify the *entire* production process with short test videos.

  Before making longer videos, make *sure* that the test videos look and sound great *when they have been uploaded*.
  
- When doing a take, flubs don't matter, *provided* you correct them *during the take*.  Use pauses.  Make haste slowly!

- Splice in new takes during post-production to fix flubs and add new material.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131129061821.16884">Here are some more tips I've learned from experience:

1. Redo audio tests and video tests every time you start a new session. It's amazing how hum can creep into recordings.

2. The most important step in post production is to get the pacing so it feels right. Beware of editing out pauses. Make sure you give your viewers time to see what you are doing, and to see what you have done.
   
3. Don't waste time on callouts or captions until the audio and video work together at a relaxed pace. It's almost as hard to correct pacing mistakes as it is to correct audio flubs.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20131211054925.16388">1. Enable volume leveling and noise removal in Camtasia. This tip, all by itself, makes a big difference.

2. Use a better microphone, preferably one with about a 1-inch diaphragm. This is the kind of microphone that Andrew Price uses. The Audio-technica AT2020 USB is relatively inexpensive.
  
3. Use "pop filter" with the microphone. This is a cloth or (better) a metal screen that is placed in front of the microphone. It smooths the sound.
  
4. Adjust the sound level for maximum volume without distortion: With the microphone about a foot from your mouth, turn the volume as loud as possible, then turn down until no red is visible in the meter.

<t tx="ekr.20140216125129.16666"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20140720203932.17747">Leo can automatically import and export Emacs org-mode (.org) files. Nodes like::

    @auto-org-mode &lt;path to .org file&gt;

or equivalently::

    @auto-org &lt;path to .org file&gt;
    
import the org-mode file as a Leo outline. 

These nodes work like other @auto nodes: when Leo loads an outline, Leo reads the .org file into the @auto-org-mode tree. When Leo writes an outline, Leo writes any @auto-org-mode tree back to the org-mode file.

After creating an @auto-org-mode node by hand, be sure to use Leo's refresh-from-disk command to populate the node. Do this *before* saving the .leo file. If you try to save an empty @auto-org-mode node Leo will warn you that you are about to overwrite the file.

The ``refresh-from-disk`` command creates an @auto-org-mode node whose **children** represent the contents of the external .org file. Leo does *not* write the @auto-org-mode node itself. This allows you to put Leo directives in the node.

<t tx="ekr.20140720203932.17748">Leo can automatically import and export vimoutline (.otl) files. Nodes like::

    @auto-otl &lt;path to .otl file&gt;

or equivalently::

<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18217">Leo's vim mode dispatches keystrokes sent to it from k.masterKeyHandler to **key handlers**.

Each key handler handles the incoming key and then calls either vc.accept(), vc.done(), vc.ignore() or vc.quit(). These methods tell k.masterKeyHandler whether vim-mode has completely handled the key. If so, k.masterKeyHandler simply returns. Otherwise, k.masterKeyHandler handles the key as usual.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18218">Key handlers handle a single key during the parsing of a vim command. Key handlers can either complete a command, thereby actually doing something, or change state so as to be able to parse (and possibly complete) the next incoming keystroke.

For example, the key handler for the G command handles the command completely. In contrast, two key handlers are needed to handle the gg command. The first handler, vc.vim_g, simply calls vc.accept(handler=vc.vim_g2). This call changes the vc.handler ivar to point to the **follow-on handler**, vim_g2. vim_g2 handles all commands after the user has typed 'g' in normal mode.

Each key handler must end with a call to an **acceptance method**. vc.accept is one such method. Acceptance methods prepare for the next keystroke by setting internal state ivars used by the various dispatchers.

Many key handlers simply call vc.done(). This method handles all the details of completing a key handler: it hides the details of parsing vim command.

**Important**: Any key handler that wants to change vc.state should set vc.state *before* calling vc.done()

Key handlers can call either **direct acceptance methods**, vc.accept, vc.delegate, vc.done, vc.ignore, vc.not_ready, vc.quit, and vc.reset, or **indirect acceptance methods**: vc.begin_insert_mode, vc.begin_motion, vc.end_insert_mode, and vc.vim_digits. Indirect acceptance methods must eventually call direct acceptance methods.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18219">Dispatchers set the following ivars for each key handler:

**vc.w** is the widget that has focus. Key handlers may use convenience methods to determine the location and type of vc.w. The most important are:

- vc.is_text_widget(w): True if w is any text widget, including headlines, body text and log pane.
  
- vc.in_headline(w): True if w is a headline widget in edit mode.

**vc.stroke** is a standard Leo stroke representing the incoming key. Note that the spelling of the stoke using the Tk spellings. Take a look at entries in the dispatch dicts to see such spellings. When in doubt, enable the trace in vc.do_key to see the incoming strokes.

**vc.n1** and **vc.n** are the repeat counts in effect for each key handler. Dispatchers and their allies handle most details of setting these repeat counts, so most key handlers can simply use vc.n1*vc.n as the ultimate repeat count.

**vc.motion_i** is the insertion point *before* the motion has taken place.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18220">The simplest way of moving the cursor or changing text is to use the vc.do method, a thin wrapper for c.k.simulateCommand.  For example::

    if vc.state == 'visual':
        vc.do('end-of-buffer-extend-selection')
    else:
        vc.do('end-of-buffer')

Key handlers may also use the **high-level interface**. This is the API used throughout Leo's core. For details, see the HighLevelInterface class in leoFrame.py and various subclasses in qtGui.py.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18221">The vc.vim_d method and its follow-on methods handle vim's d commands.

The vc.vis_d method handles the d keystroke that ends visual mode.

The following sections examine each piece of the code in detail. If you understand how it works you should know everything you need to write any other key handler.

    def vim_d(vc):
        '''

        '''
        if vc.is_text_widget(vc.w):
            vc.n = 1
            vc.accept(handler=vc.vim_d2)
        else:
            vc.quit()
@language rest

This is the key handler for the 'd' key in normal mode.

The entry in vc.normal_dispatch_d for 'd' is: 'd':vc.vim_d.

Because this command changes text, vc.is_text_widget(vc.w) must be True. If
so, this handler simply calls vc.accept(handler=vc.vim_d2) to queue up the
follow-on handler. Otherwise, the handler calls vc.quit() to end the
command.

                    s = w.getAllText()
                    i,j = g.getLine(s,i)
                    # Special case for end of buffer only for n == 1.
                    # This is exactly how vim works.
                    if vc.n1*vc.n == 1 and i == j == len(s):
                        i = max(0,i-1)
                    w.delete(i,j)
                vc.done()
            else:
                vc.d_stroke = vc.stroke # A scratch var.
                vc.begin_motion(vc.vim_d3)
        else:
            vc.quit()
@language rest

This is the follow-on handler for the 'd' command. It will be called when
the user types a *second* character following the 'd' command in normal
mode.

All forms of the 'd' command alter text, so this handler calls vc.quit if
vc.w is not a text widget.

If the second character is another 'd', we have the 'dd' command. The code
uses the high-level interface to delete a line, then calls vc.done() to end
the command.

If the second character is *not* a 'd', it should be a following motion,
such as "2j" in "d2j".

vc.vim_d2 remembers the character that started the motion in a **scratch
ivar**, vc.d_stroke. Such ivars are not inited or touched outside of vim_d
and its follow-on key handlers. This code must remember this character so
that the vim_d3 handler will know whether to expand the deleted text to a
line.

Finally, vc.vim_d2 calls vc.begin_motion, which does the following:

- Calls vc.ignore if the second character doesn't really start a motion.
- Sets vc.handler to vc.do_inner_motion.  This handles the motion.
- Sets the vc.after_motion to the next follow-on handler: vc.vim_d3.
  vc.vim_d3 will be called when the motion is complete. The details are
  complicated, but happily the key handlers don't have to know about them!

        else:
            vc.quit()
@language rest

This is the second and last follow-on handler for the d command. The
dispatcher that handles vim motions will call this handler after the
motions **have actually happened**.

First, the code double-checks that we are still in a text widget, calling
vc.quit() if not.

Next, the code compares the present insertion point, w,getInsertPoint(),
with the insertion point before the motion happened, vc.motion_i. It
extends the selection range if the scratch ivar, vc.d_stroke, is in ('jk').
The code then deletes the selected text.

Finally, this method calls vc.done().

This is the key handler for the 'd' key in normal mode.

It is *not* a follow-on method of vim_d. The dispatcher calls this method
after visual mode has highlighted text. Here is the entry for 'd' in
vc.visual_dispatch_d: 'd':vc.vis_d.

Visual mode has already highlighted the text to be deleted, so this code
simply deletes the highlighted text and calls vc.done().

<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18226">The VimCommands class in leoVim.py implements Leo's vim mode. Vim mode is active only if @bool vim-mode = True.

The following sections will be of interest only to those seeking a deep knowledge of how vim mode's dispatchers work. Such knowledge should rarely be required because dispatchers and key handlers are completely unaware of each other. Dispatch dicts and acceptance methods shield dispatchers and key handlers of all knowledge of each other. In particular, acceptance methods handle the sometimes tricky details of ending a key handler.

Leo's vim code is spectacularly different from the real vim's code. Wherever possible, Leo uses methods to hide implementation details.

Ironically, now that everything is hard coded in tables, it would be easy for plugins to customize the workings of vim-mode.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18227">The init code for each Leo commander c assigns an instance of VimCommands to c.vimCommands. This is done regardless of the @bool vim-mode setting.

Each ivar of the VimCommands class is inited by exactly one of the following::

    vc.init_constant_ivars()
    vc.init_dot_ivars()
    vc.init_persistent_ivars()
    vc.init_state_ivars()
    vc.create_dispatch_dicts()
    
In effect, this code partitions each ivar into disjoint sets. This partitioning simplifies code that must re-init some ivars but not others.

The init code creates **dispatch dicts** used by dispatchers.

<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18228">Depending on various state date, dispatchers route incoming keys to the proper **key handler**. Dispatchers use **dispatch dicts** to assign handlers to incoming keys. These dicts eliminate almost all special case code.
   
vc.do_key is the top-level dispatcher. k.masterKeyHandler calls it for all keys *except* Ctrl-G. **Note**: k.masterKeyHandler calls vc.do_key only when there no key state in effect, that is, when the minibuffer is not active.

As discussed below, the value returned by vc.do_key tells k.masterKeyHandler whether vim mode has completely handled the key.

Depending on the vc.handler ivar, vc.do_key can route the incoming key either to an **inner dispatcher** or directly to a key handler.

Inner dispatchers handle keys for a particular vim mode using dispatch dicts. Inner dispatchers the following ivars behind the scenes::

    vc.handler, vc.next_func, vc.return_value
    vc.in_motion and vc.motion_func
    
Handling these ivars can be tricky; hiding the details greatly simplifies all key handlers.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20140810085801.18229">vc.do_key returns the value of vc.return_value. Most the acceptance functions set vc.return_value to True, indicating that vim mode has completely handled the key and that k.masterKeyHandler should simply return. k.masterKeyHandler handles the key as usual if vc.do_key returns False.

Each key handler sets vc.return_value indirectly by calling an acceptance method. A simple check in vc.do_key ensures that every key handler, has, in fact, called an acceptance method. In practice, this check has been very effective.

The handler for the G command moves or extends the cursor depending on vc.state.

@language python
::

    def vim_G(vc):
        '''Put the cursor on the last character of the body pane.'''
        if vc.is_text_widget(vc.w):
            if vc.state == 'visual':
                vc.do('end-of-buffer-extend-selection')

On entry, the dispatcher has set vc.w to the widget with focus. First, the code ensures that this widget is a text widget. If so, the code uses the vc.do method, a thin wrapper for c.k.simulateCommand, to execute Leo commands by name.

Leo's minimal dependencies are:

* `Python`_ 2.6 or later, including all Python 3.x versions.
* `PyQt4`_ or `PyQt5`_.

The following packages are optional, but recommended:

* `Docutils`_: required for the rst3 command and the viewrendered plugins.
* `Sphinx`_: required to regenerate Leo's documentation.
* `PyEnchant`_: required for spell checking.

Plugins may require other packages.  For example, viewrendered requires `Markdown`_ if one wishes to use markdown rendering, but it is optional. rss.py will not function without `feedparser`_. Etc.

The body text of the @test node contains a **self-contained** unit test. For example, this creates a complete unit test::

    @test fails  (headline)
    assert False (body text)

To run this test, select the @test node and do::

    &lt;alt-x&gt;run-selected-unit-tests-locally.

Leo will create and run the unit test automatically.

To see all of Leo's unit testing commands, do::

    &lt;alt-x&gt;run&lt;tab&gt;

Leo pre-defines 'c', 'g' and 'p' in unit tests just as in scripts.

.. _`unit testing`: unitTesting.html

For more details about unit testing, the `unit testing`_ page.

**Notes for Leo developers**

leo/test/unitTest.leo contains all of Leo's own unit tests.

Running all tests is not necessary.  Just select::

    Active Unit Tests

and then do Alt-4 (run-selected-unit-tests-locally).

**Note**: Some tests will likely fail on machines other than EKR's. You only need to be concerned about unit tests that start failing after you make your changes.

File under things-I-didn't-know-but-should-have:

Instead of creating batch files all over the place to fire up python programs, and then having to cope with annoying "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?" with Ctrl-C/Break you can ask python setuptools to create an .exe in the Python\Scripts folder.

in same folder as foo.py create setup.py, populate like so::

@language python

    from setuptools import setup
    
    setup(
        name='Foo for you',
        version='0.3',
        py_modules=['foo'],
        entry_points='''
            [console_scripts]
            foo = foo
            '''
        )
    
@language rest

Then run "pip --editable install . " in the same folder. Foo.exe will be created in C:\pythonxx\Scripts. As long as that folder is in path you can use foo like any other command line program. Furthermore the "editable" parameter means we can continue to edit and change foo.py and the changes are always live.

Yeah! No more "pushd ..\path\to\data\folder &amp;&amp; python ..\path\to\code\foo.py
--do-stuff-here ..." for me. :)

Works for Leo too -- with the existing setup.py. It creates leo.exe and leoc.exe for Windowed mode (no log messages to console) and console mode respectively.

===== Terry

I use itex2MML with reStructuredText.  So within Leo you're looking at LaTeX math markup, and you get outputs in PDF and XHTML, with MathML in the latter.

===== Jose

I've been doing this for about a year now.  I use the math docutils directive.  A custom .XCompose file (for example: https://github.com/kragen/xcompose)  also helps.

===== Terry

I think math was added to docutils after I started using itex2mml, neater to use docutils built in math now I think.

Although having said that, playing with docutils math a bit suggests itex2mml gives more complete support for both MathML and perhaps LaTeX math (with the PDF target).

===== Jose

Terry, your setup is probably more flexible, but I haven't had any problems with docutils math. It seems to support all the syntax that I've found necessary.

I forgot to mention that the viewrendered plug-in doesn't display math correctly.  I'm not sure what the problem is, I remember trying to figure it out a while back, but I never got anywhere.  It's not really a big problem though, I have scripts to compile nodes to html/pdfs and open them in firefox/pdf reader; math works fine that way.

===== Offray

Is not properly Leo, but is python related, tailored for math and with a web interface and has leo bindings, check IPython: http://ipython.org/

I'm using it for all my math related writing and I think that point the future of interactive writing in Python. I dream of a body pane on leo with the features of the python qt console.

I'm trying to create a interactive chart in a embedded in a new leo pane using matplotlib. However, I am not sure about the the best way to implement this. I would appreciate some guidance on this please? The questions I would like answered are:

1. How do I create a new blank pane for embedding a chart as well as other QtWidgets.

2. Can I do this in a script or do I need to work with leo source?

I want to create a data processing and visualization tool kit in leo. Like Excel but using nodes instead of columns. Nodes will have data and I want to create new data nodes by applying python functions to data in existing nodes. The thing missing is the visualization within a leo pane (I can easily launch a chart in it's own window).

**Terry Brown**

You can run this script from any body pane::

    '''
    A script that adds a MatPlotLib pane to Leo.
    
    After running this script, right click on one of the pane dividers and
    select Insert. A new pane with a button 'Action' appears. Click it, and
    select "Add matplot" from the context menu.
    '''
    
    from leo.core.leoQt import QtWidgets
    
    class MatplotPaneProvider:
        def __init__(self, c):
            self.c = c
            if hasattr(c, 'free_layout'):
                splitter = c.free_layout.get_top_splitter()
                if splitter:
                    splitter.register_provider(self)

            # provider ID is not the same as the service id_ above
            return "completely unique value here"
    
    MatplotPaneProvider(c)

**OP**

I have managed to get a matplotlib graph embedded within a pane in leo as a widget. I now need some help with how to interact with the widget using scripts in leo. I am unsure about the following:
 
*1/ How do I expose the widget within the leo environment?* 

If you were only going to have one and you weren't going to destroy it, you could just do something simple like c._matplot = self in its constrictor (assuming c was passed to the constructor).

If you're going to have more than one and they may be destroyed, it might be simplest to let the free_layout / nested_splitter system manage them::

    ts = c.free_layout.get_top_splitter()
    matplotters = ts.findChildren(myMatplotWidget)

should return a list of the widgets of your class in the layout, but only if they're in the main window, widgets in extra windows opened from the "Open window" context menu item would be missed, I can add a find_children() method to complement the find_child() method the splitters already have to account for this.

Detail: the above is just using Qt's QObject.findChildren(), the nested_splitter find_child() and (not yet written) find_children() versions search the extra windows as well.

Here I have created a self.mat in your MatplotPaneProvider class to make the windget accessible but it doesn't feel like the correct way to do this.

@language python

    mat = MatplotPaneProvider(c)
    mat.mat.someMethod()
    mat.mat.someOtherMethod()
    
@language rest
 
2. I would also like to make the widget accessible from any script within leo. What's the leo way of doing this?

See above
 
3. If I create more than 1 pane containing these widgets. How do I switch between them in scripts?

See above

4. Running this script more than once creates multiple items for Add Matplot when pressing the Action button. How do I stop this from happening? I have already tried returning a unique integer in * ns_provider_id *but that did not work.*
 
The value returned by ns_provider_id should be unique for the provider class, but constant. So it can just return something like "matplotlib provider ver 1"

For the last several weeks I've used clones in a new, more effective way, inspired by git's stash/unstash commands. Here are the main ideas.

1. [Most important] I avoid putting clones in two different *external* files.

For any task, I create a task node that resides in @file leoToDo.txt. I clone that node and put it in the outline, *never* in any other @file node. This instantly eliminates clone wars.

2. I use top-level "stashed" nodes/trees in my local copy of leoPy.leo.

These clones are *not* written to any external file, so they would be lost if I lost leoPy.leo. But the risks are negligible because all stashed nodes are clones of nodes that *do* exist in external files.

3. I have two main stashed trees: recent files and recent code.

The "recent files" tree contains clones of all the @file nodes I have worked on recently. This speeds up access to them. That happens surprisingly often--often enough to be well worth maintaining the tree. Furthermore, because Leo's new pylint command now works on trees, I can check all recently-changed files simply by running pylint on the "recent files" tree.

The "recent code" tree is even more valuable, for three reasons. The first is obvious--it speeds access to recently-changed nodes.

Second, the "recent code" tree allows me to work on multiple tasks without getting overwhelmed by details and loose nodes lying around. I add organizer nodes as needed to make accessing the nodes faster, and also to jog my memory about what I was doing when I changed those nodes ;-)

Third, the "recent code" tree allows me *not* to put clones in the @file leoProjects.txt tree. This leads me to...

4. I use clones in a stylized way when fixing and committing bugs.

I always use clones when working on a project. A "task" node contains clones of all nodes related to the task. The task node typically remains in leoToDo.txt until the task is completely finished. While working on the bug, I create a clone of the task node, and move that clone to the bottom top-level node of the outline. Among other things, this makes it easy to limit searches without actually choosing "suboutline only" in the Find panel. This workflow is decades old.

The following is the heart of the new workflow. When a task is complete, I do the following:

A. First, I create a **stashed-task** node, containing all the clones that were previously in the task node.

The *stashed-task* becomes pre-writing for the commit log. The *task* node instantly becomes pre-writing for the release notes, so if it needs to discuss any code in the clones that have just been moved to the stashed-task node, I write those words immediately, while all details are fresh in my mind.

B. Now I move the cloned task node that is in leoToDo.txt to the appropriate place in leoProjects.txt.

C. Next I do the commit.

The *other* clone of the task node, and the stashed task node are still within easy reach, and I typically use both nodes to create the commit log. The commit will typically consist of the changed leoToDo.txt and leoProjects.txt and whatever .py files the task itself changed. Happily, leoToDo.txt and leoProjects.txt are now up-to-date because of steps A and B.

D. Finally, I clean up.

I delete the top-level clone of the task node, and move the stashed-task
node to the "recent code" tree.

E. Later, when it appears that activity has died down on various projects, I'll delete nodes from the "recent files" an "recent code" trees. This is a minor judgment call: I want to leave nodes in the trees while they are useful, but not significantly longer than that. I do *not* regard these trees as permanently useful. leoProjects.txt should contain *all* permanent notes about a project.

===== Conclusions

This work flow may seem complicated. Believe me, it is not. It's easier to use than to describe.

This workflow has big advantages:

1. Clone wars are gone for good.
2. All recent data is easily available.
3. Task nodes and stashed-task nodes provide natural places for proto-documentation.
4. Banning clones from leoProjects.txt forces me to complete the first draft of the documentation before committing the fix.

<t tx="ekr.20141109053526.8">GTD (Getting Things Done) http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280 is, by far, the best productivity book I have ever read. Many aspects of Leo are idea for putting GTD into practice.

Here is a surprisingly useful workflow tip related to GTD.

Ideas often "intrude" when I am busy with something else. When that happens, I create a top-level node of the form::

    ** description of idea

Now I can continue what I was doing! This is such a simple idea, but it's really really important: it means I never have to put off getting my ideas into Leo. The "**" draws my attention to the new to-do item. Later, when I am not fully immersed in the previous task, I can put the "**" node somewhere else.

It's super important to deal with new ideas *instantly* but *without* greatly interrupting the task at hand. Creating "**" nodes does that. This new workflow has been a big improvement to my GTD practice.

    leo --session-save --session-restore &lt;list of .leo files&gt;
    
When Leo closes, it stores session state in ``~/.leo/leo.session``. Session state consists of the list of open files and the selected node in each file. The next time Leo starts with those options, Leo will open these files and will select the appropriate nodes.

Not only do I now use Leo is a central repository for scripts I write as I explore the data, generate plots, start analyses with third party applications etc., but also for storing and organizing ideas for research and notes parsed out of PDFs of academic papers. And that's just for work!

<t tx="ekr.20150210062226.4">This appendix documents the Mulder/Ream update algorithm in detail, with an informal proof of its correctness.

Prior to Leo 5.1, Leo used Bernhard Mulder's original algorithm to read @shadow files. Starting with Leo 5.1, Leo uses this algorithm to read both @clean and @shadow files. Conceptually, both algorithms work as described in the next section.

In February 2015 EKR realized that the @shadow algorithm could be used to update @clean (@nosent) files. Simplifying the algorithm instantly became a top priority. The new code emerged several days later, made possible by the x.sentinels array. It is an important milestone in Leo's history.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150210062226.5">The algorithm depends on three simple, guaranteed, properties of
SequenceMatcher.opcodes. See
https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html#sequencematcher-examples

**Fact 1**: The opcodes tell how to turn x.a (a list of lines) into x.b
(another list of lines).

The code uses the a and b terminology. It's concise and easy to remember.

**Fact 2**: The opcode indices ai, aj, bi, bj *never* change because
neither x.a nor x.b changes.

Plain lines of the result can be built up by copying lines from x.b to x.results::

    'replace'   x.results.extend(x.b[b1:b2])
    'delete'    do nothing  (b1 == b2)
    'insert'    x.results.extend(x.b[b1:b2])
    'equal'     x.results.extend(x.b[b1:b2])

**Fact 3**: The opcodes *cover* both x.a and x.b, in order, without any gaps.

This is an explicit requirement of sm.get_opcode:

- The first tuple has ai==aj==bi==bj==0.

- Remaining tuples have ai == (aj from the preceding tuple) and bi == (bj
  from the previous tuple).
  
Keep in mind this crucial picture:

- The slices x.a[ai:aj] cover the x.a array, in order without gaps.
- The slices x.b[bi:bj] cover the x.b array, in order without gaps.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150210062226.6">Given the x.sentinels array, the strategy for creating the results is
simple. Given indices ai, aj, bi, bj from an opcode, the algorithm:

- Writes sentinels from x.sentinels[i], for i in range(ai,aj).

- Writes plain lines from b[i], for i in range(bi,bj).

This "just works" because the indices cover both a and b.

- The algorithm writes sentinels exactly once (in order) because each
  sentinel appears in x.sentinels[i] for some i in range(len(x.a)).

- The algorithm writes plain lines exactly once (in order) because
  each plain line appears in x.b[i] for some i in range(len(x.b)).

This completes an informal proof of the correctness of the algorithm.

The leading and trailing sentinels lines are easy special cases. This
code, appearing before the main loop, ensures that leading lines are
written first, and only once::

    x.put_sentinels(0)
    x.sentinels[0] = []

Similarly, this line, at the end of the main loop, writes trailing
sentinels::

    x.results.extend(x.trailing_sentinels)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150210062226.7">The algorithm creates an updated set of lines *with* sentinels using the
@clean outline and the updated external file. These new lines then replace
the original @clean with a new @clean tree. The algorithm uses only
difflib. It will work with *any* kind of text file. No knowledge of any
language is needed.

The algorithm depends on simple, guaranteed, properties of indices in
SequenceMatcher opcodes.

The algorithm steps through x.sentinels and x.b, extending x.results
as it goes.

The algorithm gets all needed data directly from opcode indices into
x.sentinels and x.b. Using opcode indices requires neither reader
classes nor auxiliary indices.

The algorithm is simple enough to be understood at first reading. I'll
remember its details for the rest of my life.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150211131925.9">Mulder's original algorithm was hard to understand or to change. The
culprit was the x.mapping array, which mapped indices into arrays of lines
*with* sentinels to indices into arrays of lines *without* sentinels.

The new algorithm replaces the x.mapping array with the x.sentinels array.
As a result, diff indices never need to be adjusted and handling diff
opcodes is easy.

For any index i, x.sentinels[i] is the (possibly empty) list of sentinel
lines that precede line a[i]. Computing x.sentinels from old_private_lines
is easy. Crucially, x.a and x.sentinels are *parallel arrays*. That is,
len(x.a) == len(x.sentinels), so indices into x.a are *also* indices into
x.sentinels.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150212182032.4"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20150220115528.4">Leo updates @clean trees using a simplified version of the Mulder update algorithm previously used to update @shadow trees. This algorithm  is easy to understand, provably correct and completely documented. It may be of interest to the developers of other outliners.

http://leoeditor.com/appendices.html#the-mulder-ream-update-algorithm
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150220145456.4">For simplicity, this discussion will assume that we are updating an
external file, x, created with @clean x. The update algorithm works
exactly the same way with @shadow trees.

The algorithm works with *any* kind of text file. The algorithm uses only
difflib. It knows nothing about the text or its meaning. No parsing is ever
done.

Suppose file x has been changed outside of Leo. When Leo reads x it does
the following:

1. Recreates the *old* version of x *without* sentinels by writing the
   @clean x *outline* into a string, as if it were writing the @clean x
   outline again.
   
2. Recreates all the lines of x *with* sentinels by writing the @clean x
   *outline* into a string, as if it was writing an @file node! Let's call
   these lines the **old sentinels** lines.
   
3. Uses difflib.SequenceMatcher to create a set of diffs between the
   old and new versions of x *without* sentinels.
   
   **Terminology**: the diffs tell how to change file a into file b. The
   actual code uses this terminology: **a** is set of lines in the old
   version of x, **b** is the set of lines in the new version of x.
   
4. Creates a set of lines, the **new sentinels lines** using the old
   sentinels lines, the a and b lines and the diffs.
   
   This is the magic. Bernhard Mulder's genius was conceiving that a
   three-way merge of lines could produce the new outline, *with*
   sentinels. The code is in x.propagate_changed_lines and its helpers.
   
5. Replaces the @clean tree with the new tree created by reading the new
   sentinels lines with the @file read logic.

**Important**: The update algorithm never changes sentinels. It never
inserts or deletes nodes. The user is responsible for creating nodes to
hold new lines, or for deleting nodes that become empty as the result of
deleting lines.

<t tx="ekr.20150311123850.39">Sentinels are necessary for clones, but sentinels would still be necessary if clones did not exist.

Sentinels create **identity**, the notion that a particular nodes starts at *this* place in the external file and extends to *this other* place. Identity is a persistent, invariant attribute of a file: Leo recreates all the nodes of the external files when re-reading the file.

It's really that simple, but here are some consequences:

1. Identity remains even when the contents of a node changes. Thus, there is *no way* to use content-related mechanisms to recreate identity. Git can never help recover identity.

2. Leo's sentinels mark an *arbitrary* range of text within the external file. @auto files can never be as flexible as @file nodes.

<t tx="ekr.20150312080344.12">Leo's Gui code is built on wrapper and widget classes. A **widget** is an actual Qt widget. A **wrapper** is an object whose API hides the details of the underlying gui **text** widgets. Leo's core code usually uses wrappers, not raw widgets.

There is a back door for special cases. All wrapper classes define an official ``widget`` ivar, so core or plugin code can gain access to the real Qt widget using ``wrapper.widget``. Searching for ``wrapper.widget`` should find all gui-dependent snippets of code in Leo's core.

Wrappers allow the same text-handling code to work regardless of whether the actual text widgets are a QTextBrowser or a QsciScintilla object. Without wrappers, all of Leo's text-editing commands would have to know the details of the api of the actual Qt text widget!
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150312080344.14">@language rest
.. @language python below

Various vim commands advertise, just by having a tab_callback method, that they want to handle a tab that follows their name. ga.do_tab then defers to the vim command. Vim's tab handler no longer knows *anything* about colon commands, or what any command intends to do with the tab. If the command handler has a tab_callback attribute, vim's tab handler just calls it.

Here is the flattened form of the class that handles the :tabnew command. Note that the __call__ and tab_callback methods are trivial::

@language python
    
    class Tabnew:
        '''
        A class to handle Vim's :tabnew command.
        This class supports the do_tab callback.
        '''
        def __init__(self,vc):
            '''Ctor for VimCommands.tabnew class.'''
            self.vc = vc
        __name__ = ':tabnew'
            # Required.
    
        def __call__(self,event=None):
            '''Prompt for a file name, the open a new Leo tab.'''
            self.vc.c.k.getFileName(event,callback=self.open_file_by_name)
           
        def tab_callback(self):
            '''Called when the user types :tabnew&lt;tab&gt;'''
            self.vc.c.k.getFileName(event=None,callback=self.open_file_by_name)
           
        def open_file_by_name(self,fn):
            c = self.vc.c
            if fn and not g.os_path_isdir(fn):
                c2 = g.openWithFileName(fn,old_c=c)
                try:
                    g.app.gui.runAtIdle(c2.treeWantsFocusNow)
                except Exception:
                    pass
            else:
                c.new()
            
@language rest

This pattern is particularly well suited to Leo, because the various getPublicCommands methods reference those functions in their command dictionaries. Here, the new entries are::

@language python

    ':tabnew':  vc.Tabnew(vc),

The leo/plugins/writers folders now contain writer plugins.

Both importer and writer plugins can defined new kinds of @auto nodes.

Importers and writers can register either @auto-names or file extensions. For example, @auto x.xyzzy will use both the importer and the writer for the .xyzzy extension, that is, importers/test.py and writers/test.py. So, for *unique* extensions, there is no need to use a separate @auto name, you can just use @auto.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150312080344.28">In February 2015 I realized that the @shadow algorithm could be used to update @clean (aka @nosent) files. This inspired me to simplify the @shadow update algorithm. The Mulder/Ream algorithm emerged several days later.

Thinking of using Leo as a diff program may have been the line of thought that lead to @clean. It turned my attention to the @shadow algorithm, and that may have been enough to see that the algorithm could get sentinels from the .leo file instead of hidden shadow files.

I'll probably never be able to recreate a clearer picture of how the Aha came to be.  That's the nature of big Aha's: they obliterate previous ways of thought so completely that it's hard to remember the time before the Aha.

History of Leo
##############

This chapter discusses the most important milestones in history of Leo and summarizes each of Leo's public releases.  The focus is on the *important* and *interesting* developments.  It is not a chronicle of every change made to Leo.

One of Leo's most important developments, @button, came directly from e's dyna_menu plugin. The exact date seems lost, but it certainly existed by Leo 4.3.

<t tx="ekr.20150313053238.40">Missing modules can cause installation problems. If the installer doesn't work (or puts up a dialog containing no text), you may install Leo from the .zip file as described at `How to install Leo on Windows`_. However you are installing Leo, be sure to `run Leo in a console`_. because as a last resort Leo prints error messages to the console.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150313053238.44">I just want to provide my own thoughts about the importance of @clean. I look at the posts in this group a fair amount because I find the discussion interesting but I had abandoned leo as a day-to-day tool principally because of the sentinels in @file nodes. Even for solo projects, I just found them visually unappealing and beyond that occasionally confusing when I went to edit files with external editors. I would sometimes start a project in leo, particularly if it was based on code I developed in the past using leo, and then would use the old @nosent to save a version of the code without sentinels and then use my external editor of choice and not use leo at all. I missed many of the features of leo but just couldn't get over the sentinel issue.

@clean really seems to solve all the issues that I had. In particular--and somehow this point doesn't seem to me to have been emphasized enough--it seems to fully support organizer nodes. They are one of the great things about leo--it's happy to guess initially at what the structure of your program is but it's completely up to you to determine the structure and the ability to do things like break up long methods, group like methods, group menu actions in GUI code, etc etc is one of the very cool things about leo. My limited but growing experience with @clean's handling of external changes has been mainly with incremental (as opposed to more sweeping) code changes, and the assignment of new lines is reasonable and you can always fix them it quickly if you don't like how external changes have been handled.

There have been some posts about the recovered nodes, comparing the old and new nodes where there were external changes. I think it's genius. As opposed to hoping that leo has correctly incorporated external changes, it's all there in case you want to take a closer look. Without this, I would just not have the confidence that external changes were being applied correctly and while you can always do a git diff, I am not looking to do that every time I change a file externally especially if I am not at the point where I am about to do a commit.

There has been some discussion of @auto v. @clean. Preference is obviously a matter of taste. I will say that for me the fact that node headlines are unaffected by external file changes is a feature not a problem since I place notes in the headlines that I want preserved when I edit files externally. Yes, if the node headlines are the method names then they won't be updated if an external edit changes a method name but this was true of @file as well.

The ability to work on projects with people who don't have leo is obvious; one perhaps slightly less obvious benefit of no sentinels is that I suspect that the likelihood that someone will clone a git repository is reduced when that repository's code is riddled with leo sentinels (unless the potential cloner is a leo loyalist). The one downside to no sentinels--there is no evidence that leo is being used but I think that raises the broader question of marketing leo, which I certainly believe will be aided significantly by being able to take advantage of leo without sentinels in external files.

<t tx="ekr.20150313053238.45">.. _`recursive import script`: scripting-miscellany.html#recursive-import-script
.. _git: http://git-scm.com/

@clean is the long-sought breakthrough that just might allow Leo to "go viral". For the very first time, Leo can be used in *all* situations without compromise.  There is no longer any need to make excuses for sentinel lines, or argue whether people should accept them.  Sentinels are simply gone.

I have just realized how inconvenient sentinels might be for my *own* work flow.  This was a shocking revelation.  To illustrate, here is an excerpt from the programming tutorial:

When I study other people's code I do the following:

- Create a git repo of the directory to be studied, adding all the source files and doing an initial commit.
 
- Use an `recursive import script`_ to create the desired @clean nodes.

- Explicitly save all the imported files using Ctrl-Shift-W (write-at-file-nodes).

- Use `git`_ diff to ensure that no important changes have been made while importing the nodes.

- Use git diff to track any changes I make (such as adding tracing or debugging statements) for the purposes of studying the code. Using @clean is an essential part of this work flow. The diffs would be much harder to read if I had imported files into @file trees instead.

In short, I have just now realized how badly sentinels interfered with git diffs.

``Alt-0 (vr-toggle)``
    Hides or shows the viewrendered pane.
``Alt-T (focus-to-tree)``
    Puts focus in the outline pane, regardless of focus.
``Ctrl-T (toggle-active-pane)``
    Toggles focus between the outline and body panes.
``Ctrl-Tab (tab-cycle-next)``
    Switches between outline tabs. You may open multiple Leo outlines in different tabs within the same main window.
``Ctrl-G (keyboard-quit)``
    Puts focus in the body pane. More effective than hitting Alt-Tab twice.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.20">Leo supports unlimited undo and redo with the ``undo`` (Ctrl-Z) and ``redo`` (Ctrl-Shift-Z) commands. Think of actions that may be undone or redone as a string of beads. A "bead pointer" points to the present bead. Performing an operation creates a new bead after the present bead and removes all following beads. Undoing an operation moves the bead pointer backwards; redoing an operation moves the bead pointer forwards. The ``undo`` command is disabled when the bead pointer moves in front of the first bead; the ``redo`` command is disabled when the bead pointer points to the last bead.

The @string undo_granularity setting controls the granularity of undo. There are four possible values:

``node``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to a new node.

``line (default)``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to new line.

``word``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing starts a new word.

``char`` (not recommended)
    Starts a new undo unit for each character typed.
    This wastes lots of computer memory.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.21">``cut-text (Ctrl-X)``
    Cut the selected text and put it to the clipboard.
``copy-text (Ctrl-C)``
    Copy the selected text to the clipboard.
``paste-text (Ctrl-V)``
    Paste test from the clipboard.
``select-all(Ctrl-A)``
    Select all text in the text pane.

These commands work with either headline or body text.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.22">``indent-region (Tab)`` 
    Shift selected lines right one tab position. Inserts one unit of indentation if no text is selected.
``unindent-region (Shift-Tab)``
    Shifts selected lines left one tab position. Deletes one unit of indentation if no text is selected.
    
**Notes**:

- These commands shift the entire line if any characters in that line are selected. If no text is selected.

- The @tabwidth directive determines which characters these commands insert or delete.

- Leo auto indents unless @nocolor is in effect.  Typing a newline automatically inserts the same leading whitespace present on the previous line.

- If Python is the present language, Leo inserts an additional tab if the previous line ends with a colon.  When the ``smart_auto_indent setting`` is True, Leo uses Emacs-style auto-indentation instead.  This style of auto-indent aligns newly created lines with unmatched ``( [{`` brackets in the previous line.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.23">``add-comments (Ctrl-))``
    Adds comments to the selected lines, using single-line comments if possible.
``delete-comments (Ctrl-()``
    Deletes comments in the selected lines.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.24">.. _`Python's time module`: http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html

``clean-lines``
    Removes trailing whitespace from all lines, preserving newlines.
``clear-selected-text``
    Delete the selected text.
``convert-tabs``
    Converts leading tabs to blanks in a single node.
``convert-blanks``
    Converts blanks to tabs in a single node.
``convert-all-tabs``
    Converts leading tabs to blanks throughout the selected tree.
``convert-all-blanks``
    Converts leading blanks to tabs throughout the selected tree.
    
**@tabwidth**: The ``convert-*`` commands convert between tabs and blanks using the @tabwidth setting presently in effect.

``flush-lines``
    Deletes each line that contains a match for regexp, operating on the text after point.
    In Transient Mark mode, if the region is active, the command operates on the region instead.

``insert-body-time`` and ``insert-headline-time``
    Insert formatted time and date into body or headline text. You must be editing a headline to be able to insert the time/date into the headline. The body_time_format_string and headline_time_format_string settings specify the format of the inserted text. These settings are the format string passed to time.strftime.
    
**Time format**: For format options see `Python's time module`_. By default, the commands use ``%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S``, giving timestamps like ``1/30/2003 8:31:55``.

``keep-lines``
    Deletes each line that does not contain a match for regexp, operating on the text after point. In Transient Mark mode, if the region is active, the command operates on the region instead. 

``pretty-print-python-code`` and ``pretty-print-all-python-code``
    Pretty prints body text. You can customize this code by overriding the following methods of class prettyPrinter in leoCommands.py::

        putOperator:      puts whitespace around operators.
        putNormalToken:   puts whitespace around everything else.

``reformat-paragraph (Ctrl-Shift-P)``
    Rearranges the words in a text paragraph to fill each line as full as possible, up to the @pagewidth setting. A paragraph is delimited by blank lines, Leo directives, and (of course) start and end of text in a node. The width of the line used by the reformatting operation is governed by @pagewidth and the indentation that would be applied to the node when Leo writes the file.

The command operates on the paragraph containing the insert cursor. If the insert cursor is on a blank line or directive, nothing happens. If the cursor is on a line containing text, then the paragraph containing that text line is reformatted and the insert cursor is moved to the next paragraph.

**Note**: Hanging indentation is preserved. This is most useful for bulleted or numbered lists, such as::

  1. This is the first paragraph,
     and it has a hanging indentation.

  2. This is the second paragraph,
     and it too has a hanging indentation.
     
``replace-current-character``
     Replace the selected character with the next character typed.
``toggle-angle-brackets``
    Adds or removes double angle brackets from the headline of the selected node.
``unformat-paragraph (Ctrl-Shift-U)``
    Removes all extra whitespace from a paragraph, including leading whitespace.  This command is useful when @wrap is in effect.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.25">``extract (Ctrl-Shift-D)``
    Creates a new node whose headline is the first line of selected body text and whose body is all other lines of selected text. Previously selected text is deleted from the original body text.
``extract-names (Ctrl-Shift-N)``
    Creates one or more child nodes, one for each section name in the selected body text. The headline of each created node is the section name.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.26">``execute-script (Ctrl-B)``
    Executes body text as a Python script. Leo execute the selected text, or the entire body text if no text is selected. The Execute Script command pre-defines the values c, g and p as follows:

- c is the commander of the outline containing the script.
- g is the leoGlobals modules.
- p is c.p, that is, c.currentPosition().

**Important**: Body text may contain Leo directives and section references. You can use all of Leo's features to organize scripts that you execute interactively. Section definitions must appear in the node containing the script or in descendant nodes.

Leo preprocesses all scripts by simulating the writing of a external file to a string. The ``execute-script`` command sets app.scriptDict["script1"] to the value of the script before preprocessing, and sets app.scriptDict["script2"] to the value of the script after preprocessing. Scripts may examine and change app.scriptDict as they please.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.27">``add-editor``
    Adds a new editor in the body pane and gives it the body editor focus.
``delete-editor``
    Deletes the editor with body editor focus.
``cycle-editor-focus``
    Cycles body editor focus between editors in the body text. The editor that has focus shows the content of the selected outline node; the other body editors continue to show the node contents they last had when they had the body editor focus.

``new (Ctrl-N)``
    Creates a new Leo main window.
``open-outline (Ctrl-O)``
    Opens an existing .leo file. Selecting a non-.leo file loads the file into an @edit node in the present outline.
``open-outline-by-name``
    Opens the file given by typing the filename in the minibuffer. Supports filename completion.
``read-outline-only``
    Reads only the .leo file, not any external files.
``revert``
    Reloads the outline, discarding any changes made since it was last saved.
``save-all``
    Saves all open tabs windows/tabs. 
``save-buffers-kill-leo``
    Quits Leo, prompting to save any unsaved files first. 
``save-file or file-save (Ctrl-S)``
    Saves the Leo window to a file.
``save-file-as``
    Saves a copy of the Leo outline, changing outline's file name.
``save-file-to``
    Saves a copy of the Leo outline, without changing the outline's file name
``save-file-as-zipped``
    Same as ``save-file-as``, compressing the .leo file with Python's zipfile module.
``save-file-as-unzipped``
    Same as ``save-as``, suppressing compression.


**About compression**: The ``save-file``, ``save-file-as`` and ``save-file-to`` commands compress the file if it was originally compressed. Leo always uses the .leo extension, regardless of whether the file is zipped. Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose name is the same as the .leo file itself. Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or other program to expand the .leo file contained within.

**Opening specific files**:

``open-cheat-sheet-leo``
    Opens CheatSheet.leo in a new tab or window.
``open-leoDocs-leo``
    Opens LeoDocs.leo in a new tab or window.
``open-leoPlugins-leo``
    Opens LeoPlugins.leo in a new tab or window.
``open-scripts-leo``
    Opens scripts.leo in a new tab or window.

**About open-with**:

1. Leo creates a temporary file and invokes an external program. Leo periodically checks whether this temporary file has changed; Leo changes the corresponding node in the outline if so. You must create the entries using an @openwith node in myLeoSettings.leo. See the documentation there.

2. All open-with commands require that the corresponding @openwith node correctly specifies an editor.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.48">``copy-node (Ctrl-Shift-C)``
    Copies a node and all its descendants to the clipboard
``cut-node (Ctrl-Shift-X)``
    Copies a node and all its descendants to the clipboard and then delete them.
``delete-node``
    Deletes a node and all its descendants.
``paste-node (Ctrl-Shift-V)``
    Pastes a node and its descendants from the outline. This commands creates *copies* of nodes, not clones.
``past-retaining-clones``
    Pastes a node and its descendants from the outline.  This command preserves the identify (gnx's) of the pasted nodes, thereby preserving any clone links. This command ensures that no newly-pasted node is an ancestor of itself.

**Outline representation**: When cutting or copying an outline to the clipboard, Leo writes the outline in the same xml (text) format used in .leo files. You may copy this text representation into a body pane (or into any other text editor) using ``Ctrl-V``.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.49">``move-outline-down (Ctrl-D or Shift-Down or Alt-Shift-Down)``
    Move the selected node down, if possible.
``move-outline-left (Ctrl-L or Shift-Left or Alt-Shift-Left)``
    Move the selected node left, if possible.
``move-outline-right (Ctrl-R or Shift-Right or Alt-Shift-Right)`` 
    Move the selected node right, if possible.
``move-outline-up (Ctrl-U or Shift-Up Alt-Shift-Up)``
    Move the selected node up, if possible.

**Alt Modifiers not needed in the outline pane**: When focus is in the outline pane, you can move nodes without adding the Alt modifier. Shift-Up moves the select node up, etc.

**Important**: The following commands reorganize groups of nodes:

``de-hoist``
    Undoes the effect of the previous ``hoist`` command.
``demote (Ctrl-])``
    Makes all following siblings of a node children of the node.
``hoist``
    Redraws the screen so presently selected tree becomes the only visible part of the outline. You may hoist an outline as many times as you wish.
``promote (Ctrl-[)``
    Makes all the children of a node siblings of the node.
``sort-children``
    Sort all children of the children of the present node by their headlines.
``sort-siblings (Alt-A)``
    Sort the present node and all its siblings by their headlines.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.50">``code-to-rst``
    Format the presently selected node as computer code.
``flatten-outline-to-node``
    Appends the headline and body text of all descendants of the selected node to the body text of the selected node.
``head-to-prev-node``
    Moves non-empty text preceding a class, method or function definition to the end of the previous sibling node.
``parse-body``
    Parse p.b as source code, creating a tree of descendant nodes.
    This is essentially an import of p.b.
``tail-to-next-node``
    Moves non-empty text following a class, method or function definition to the start of the next sibling node.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.51">You may drag a node (including all its descendants) from one place to another in an outline. To start a drag, press the main (left) mouse button while the cursor is over the icon for a node. The cursor will change to a hand icon. If you release the mouse button while the hand cursor is above another node, Leo will move the dragged node after that node. If you release the mouse button when the hand cursor is not over a node, Leo will leave the outline pane as it is. Leo scrolls the outline pane as the result of mouse-moved events, so to continue scrolling you must keep moving the mouse.

If the recipient node has children and is expanded, the dropped node will be inserted as the first child of the recipient node, otherwise the dropped node will be inserted after the recipient node.

Holding down Alt before releasing the node will force insertion as a child of the recipient node, even if the recipient node is not expanded. Holding down Control before releasing the node will cause a clone to be dropped, leaving the original where it was.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.52">``copy-marked``
    Copies all marked nodes as children of a new node. 
``diff-marked-nodes``
    When exactly two nodes are marked, this command creates a diff node as the last top-level node whose children are clones of the marked nodes.
``goto-next-marked``
    Selects the next marked node.
``mark (Ctrl-M)``
    Marks node if it is unmarked, and unmarks the node if it is already marked.
``mark-changed-items``
    Marks all nodes whose headline or body text has been changed since the file was last saved.
``mark-subheads``
    Marks all children of the presently selected node.
``marked-list``
    Lists all marked nodes in the Nav pane.
``unmark-all``
    Unmarks all marked nodes in the outline.

**Marking groups of nodes**: Leo's find and change commands mark nodes if the "Mark Changes" and "Mark Finds" checkboxes are checked. You can change these checkboxes with the ``toggle-find-mark-changes-option`` and ``toggle-find-mark-finds-option`` commands.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.53">``clone-marked-nodes``

``delete-marked-nodes``
    Deletes all marked nodes.
``move-marked-nodes``
    Moves all nodes to be children of the present position.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.54">``file-compare-leo-files``
    Prompts for another (presumably similar) .leo file that will be compared with the presently selected outline file (main window). It then creates clones of all inserted, deleted and changed nodes.
``file-diff-files``
    Creates a node and puts the diff between 2 files into it. 
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.55">@chapter trees define chapters. Selecting a chapter makes only those nodes in the chapter visible, much like a hoist. The ``main`` chapter represents the entire outline. Selecting the ``main`` chapter shows all outline nodes.

``chapter-select-main``
    Selects the main chapter.
    
``chapter-select-&lt;chapter-name&gt;``
    Each @chapter node in the outline creates a corresponding chapter-select command.
    
``chapter-next``
    Selects the next chapter.
    
``chapter-back``
    Selects the previous chapter.

Associated settings:

``@bool use_chapters``
    True: chapters are enabled.

<t tx="ekr.20150318110552.74">**Important**: The following describes Leo's new abbreviation scheme.  Such abbreviations *fire immediately* whenever they are completed. You do *not* have to execute a command!  By convention, abbreviations end with ``;;``, something you are not likely to type by accident, but you can pick any abbreviation you like.

**Note**:

1. The @data abbreviations-subst-env node contains a script defining the environment in which all abbreviations execute. This allows helper functions to be defined. Very handy.
   
2. Scripts may span multiple lines. Line starting with "\:" (2 characters) continue a script. This allows abbreviations to define multi-line templates.  Helpers defined in @data abbreviations-subst-env can fill in templates with *calculated* (not predefined) data.
   
3. Templates may contain placeholders that the user can fill in.  By default, the double comma binding selects the next placeholder.

4. Added a new setting: @bool scripting-abbreviations, default False. Scripting abbreviations will be enabled if *either* of the following is True::

    @bool scripting-abbreviations
    @bool scripting-at-script-nodes
    
This is a safety feature: it allows scripting abbreviations to be enabled *without* enabling the (very dangerous in general) scripting-at-script-nodes setting.

5. Added a new example node: @@data abbreviations examples.  This contains
   several extremely useful scripts.

<t tx="ekr.20150323102036.1">@language rest

Scripts and plugins can call g.app.idleTimeManager.add_callback(callback) to cause
the callback to be called at idle time forever. This should suffice for most purposes::

@language python

    def print_hi():
        print('hi')
    
    g.app.idleTimeManager.add_callback(print_hi)

@language rest

For greater control, g.IdleTime is a thin wrapper for the Leo's IdleTime class. The IdleTime class executes a handler with a given delay at idle time. The handler takes a single argument, the IdleTime instance::

@language python
    
    def handler(it):
        """IdleTime handler.  it is an IdleTime instance."""
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace(it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),'%2.4f' % (delta_t))
        if it.count &gt;= 5:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    # Execute handler every 500 msec. at idle time.
    it = g.IdleTime(handler,delay=500)
    if it: it.start()

@language rest

The code creates an instance of the IdleTime class that calls the given handler at idle time, and no more than once every 500 msec.  Here is the output::

    handler 1 ekr.leo 0.5100
    handler 2 ekr.leo 1.0300
    handler 3 ekr.leo 1.5400
    handler 4 ekr.leo 2.0500
    handler 5 ekr.leo 2.5610
    handler done
    
Timer instances are completely independent::

@language python

    def handler1(it):
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace('%2s %s %2.4f' % (it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),delta_t))
        if it.count &gt;= 5:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    def handler2(it):
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace('%2s %s %2.4f' % (it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),delta_t))
        if it.count &gt;= 10:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    it1 = g.IdleTime(handler1,delay=500)
    it2 = g.IdleTime(handler2,delay=1000)
    if it1 and it2:
        it1.start()
        it2.start()
        
@language rest

Here is the output::

    handler1  1 ekr.leo 0.5200
    handler2  1 ekr.leo 1.0100
    handler1  2 ekr.leo 1.0300

**Recycling timers**

The g.app.idle_timers list retrains references to all timers so they *won't* be recycled after being stopped.  This allows timers to be restarted safely.

There is seldom a need to recycle a timer, but if you must, you can call its destroySelf method. This removes the reference to the timer in g.app.idle_timers. **Warning**: Accessing a timer after calling its destroySelf method can lead to a hard crash.

If the cursor is between two brackets the search is made for the bracket matching the leftmost bracket.

<t tx="ekr.20150326140024.1">I just want to provide my own thoughts about the importance of @clean. I look at the posts in this group a fair amount because I find the discussion interesting but I had abandoned Leo as a day-to-day tool principally because of the sentinels in @file nodes. Even for solo projects, I just found them visually unappealing and beyond that occasionally confusing when I went to edit files with external editors. I would sometimes start a project in Leo, particularly if it was based on code I developed in the past using Leo, and then would use the old @nosent to save a version of the code without sentinels and then use my external editor of choice and not use Leo at all. I missed many of the features of Leo but just couldn't get over the sentinel issue.

@clean really seems to solve all the issues that I had. In particular--and
somehow this point doesn't seem to me to have been emphasized enough--it seems to fully support organizer nodes. They are one of the great things about Leo--it's happy to guess initially at what the structure of your program is but it's completely up to you to determine the structure and the ability to do things like break up long methods, group like methods, group menu actions in GUI code, etc etc is one of the very cool things about Leo. My limited but growing experience with @clean's handling of external changes has been mainly with incremental (as opposed to more sweeping) code changes, and the assignment of new lines is reasonable and you can always fix them it quickly if you don't like how external changes have been handled.

There have been some posts about the recovered nodes, comparing the old and new nodes where there were external changes. I think it's genius. As opposed to hoping that Leo has correctly incorporated external changes, it's all there in case you want to take a closer look. Without this, I would just not have the confidence that external changes were being applied correctly and while you can always do a git diff, I am not looking to do that every time I change a file externally especially if I am not at the point where I am about to do a commit.

There has been some discussion of @auto v. @clean. Preference is obviously a matter of taste. I will say that for me the fact that node headlines are unaffected by external file changes is a feature not a problem since I place notes in the headlines that I want preserved when I edit files externally. Yes, if the node headlines are the method names then they won't be updated if an external edit changes a method name but this was true of @file as well.

The ability to work on projects with people who don't have Leo is obvious; one perhaps slightly less obvious benefit of no sentinels is that I suspect that the likelihood that someone will clone a git repository is reduced when that repository's code is riddled with Leo sentinels (unless the potential cloner is a Leo loyalist). The one downside to no sentinels--there is no evidence that Leo is being used but I think that raises the broader question of marketing Leo, which I certainly believe will be aided significantly by being able to take advantage of Leo without sentinels in external files.--- Steve Zatz

<t tx="ekr.20150415105956.1">clone-find-all-flattened often includes clones of nodes whose location is unclear.  No problem! Just select the mysterious node and do Alt-N (goto-next-clone). Leo will select the next clone of that node, wrapping the search as necessary.  One or two Alt-N takes me to the "real" node, the node having an ancestor @&lt;file&gt; node.

Ideally, the meaning of all nodes would be clear from their headlines.  I typically use the following conventions. For section definitions, the headline should contain file or class name.  Examples::

    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; (leoCommands.py)
    &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt; (LeoApp)

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150415110715.1">Clone wars can be most annoying. The solution is simple::

    **Keep clones only in the outline and in one other external file**

In particular, catchall files like leo/doc/leoProjects.txt or leo/doc/leoToDo.txt should never contain clones.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150415111217.1">Clones make reorganizing an outline significantly easier and faster.  Simply make top-level clones of the nodes you keep encountering during the reorg. This makes moving a node a snap: just move it from one clone to another.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150415111549.1">The c.cloneFindAllAtNode and c.cloneFindAllFlattenedAtNode methods start the clone-find-all and clone-find-all-flattened commands at a particular node. For example, here is the body of ``@button cfa-code @args add`` in leoPy.leo::

    c.cloneFindAllFlattenedAtNode('Code',top_level=True)
    
The ``@args add`` part of the headline causes Leo to add the ``cfa-code`` command to Leo's history list, so there is no urgent need to use a separate key binding for this command.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150416100041.1">When organizing data into nodes, **every item should clearly belong to exactly one top-level category**. In other words, avoid top-level *aggregate* categories.

For example, the following are poor top-level categories. They are poor because any item in them could be placed in a more explicit category:

- Contrib
- Developing Leo
- Important
- Maybe
- Others
- Prototype
- Recent
- Won't do/Can't do

We all have had bad experiences with the dreaded "Others" category. The Aha! is that all aggregate categories are just as bad as "Others".

**Note**: I have been talking only about top-level categories.  Within a single category aggregate categories may be useful.  However, when possible I prefer to mark items rather than create subcategories. For example, ``*`` now marks all "Important" items in leoToDo.txt and scripts.leo.  This makes it easy to find important items in a particular category.  To find *all* important items one could do a regex search for ``^\*`` in headlines.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150417041505.1">Leo's handling of focus is complicated in order to reduce unwanted screen flash. The following methods queue *requests* for focus::

    c.bodyWantsFocus()
    c.logWantsFocus()
    c.minibufferWantsFocus()
    c.treeWantsFocus()
    c.widgetWantsFocus(w)
    
Similarly, c.redraw and c.recolor queue requests to redraw the outline pane and to recolorize the body pane.
    
c.outerUpdate honors all requests after the present command completes, that is, just before idle time.

Sometimes a command requires that an action happen immediately.  The following methods queue a request and then immediately call c.outerUpdate::

    c.bodyWantsFocusNow()
    c.logWantsFocusNow()
    c.minibufferWantsFocusNow()
    c.recolor_now()
    c.redraw_now()

    When True, Leo beautifies all changed files when saving an outline. The default must always be False in leoSettings.leo and in unitTest.leo.

``@bool tidy-keep-blank-lines = False``
    When True, the beautifier retains blank lines within classes, functions and methods.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150603115243.1">``@killbeautify``
    This directive completely disables beautification for an entire tree. This is typically required for files containing ``@all``.

``@beautify`` and ``@nobeautify``
    These directives apply to a node and its descendants, until overridden later in a descendants. Both these directives may appear in the same node.  Such **ambiguous directives** do not affect the beautification of descendant nodes.  If both ``@beautify`` and ``@nobeautify`` appear in a node, the first directive determines whether the node will be beautified.
    
For example::

    @beautify
    ...
    @nobeautify

beautifies the entire node.  Otoh::

    @nobeautify
    ...
    @beautify

skips beautification of the entire node. Yes, this is less precise than one could imagine, but it's good enough for now.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150603115311.1">The following 5 problems are relatively minor.  They apply only to the Python beautifier. The workaround in most cases is to use ``@nobeautify``.

**1. Syntax Errors**

The pass hack converts::

    if 1:
        &lt;&lt; a section &gt;&gt;

to::

    if 1:
        #!!!!! &lt;&lt; a section &gt;&gt;
        pass

which is usually, but not always, syntactically correct Python. Here is an example from Leo's core::

    patterns = [
        &lt;&lt; Sherlock patterns for pylint &gt;&gt;
    ]

The pass hack produces syntactically incorrect code::

    patterns = [
        #!!!!! &lt;&lt; Sherlock patterns for pylint &gt;&gt;
        pass
    ]

**2. Alignment**

The beautifier eliminates blanks used to align code.  For example::

    d = {
        key1:     value1,
        longKey2: value2,
    }

The beautifier might preserve such lines, but there are no plans at present to do so.

The regular expression: ``=([ ])*\{([^}])*$`` will discover complex dictionaries that you may want to protect with ``@nobeautify``.

**3. Operator priority**

Pep 8 suggests considering eliminating blanks around higher-priority operators.  The beautifier puts blank lines about all operators, except unary operators.

This is a difficult problem of style, for which no approach works in all cases.  Surprisingly, retaining blanks around ``*`` usually looks best in Leo's own code.

**4. @clean &amp; @auto**

Consider adding @nobeautify for all ``@auto`` and ``@clean`` nodes, on the theory that such nodes are not primarily your responsibility.  But adding ``@nobeautify`` is completely up to you.

**5. Extra blank lines**

The beautifier will sometimes insert extra spaces between class/def lines and preceding comments.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150603115400.1">You may invoke a *lightly tested* stand-alone version the Python beautifier from the command line.

You can run leoBeautify.py from any directory, provided that a copy of leoGlobals.py exists in the same directory.

Run the stand-alone beautifier as follows::

    python -m leoBeautify file1, file2, ...

To get a usage message, do::

    python -m leoBeautify -h

This produces::

    Usage: python leoBeautify -m file1, file2, ...
    
    Options:
      -h, --help             show this help message and exit
      -d, --debug            print the list of files and exit
      -k, --keep-blank-lines keep-blank-lines

<t tx="ekr.20150603120140.1">.. _`Pep 8 recommendations for whitespace`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements
.. _`pep 8 recommendations for blank lines`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#blank-lines

The beautifier will *just work* for most people. 

The beautifier follows the `Pep 8 recommendations for whitespace`_. It ensures that names, operators, strings and comments are separated by zero or one blanks::

    def spam(a, b, c=5, *args, **keys):
        foo(a, 25, b=2)
        a = b + c - 5
        b = -d
        if 0 &lt; b &lt; 26:
            ...

Leo follows the `pep 8 recommendations for blank lines`_ *between* classes and defs, with minor variations due to Leo's node structure.

Optionally, the beautifier can remove blank lines *within* classes and defs, controlled by the setting *@bool tidy-keep-blank-lines*.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150603120150.1">Except for dictionary definitions, the beautifier does what is expected, leaving difficult or idiosyncratic cases completely at the user's discretion.

- For the first time ever, Leo's beautify commands work properly with Leonine syntax.
- All files in leoPy.leo can now be beautified without fuss.
- Except for spacing around operators, the beautifier mostly leaves your code **as it is**.
- The beautifier makes no difficult choices. It preserves your choices.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150603120245.1">The following could be done only at the cost of more settings and debates about what the default settings should be.

- Splitting long lines.
- Improving spacing around operators.
- Moving or indenting comment lines.

All these involve significant personal judgments and preferences. Pep 8 explicitly allows various approaches.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150603120515.1">The Python beautifier never creates new lines! The beautifier never adds or changes:

- Line breaks for "long" lines.
- Line breaks in function argument lists.
- Leading whitespace in continued argument lines.
- Line breaks call arguments.
- Leading whitespace in continue function call arguments.
- Whitespace (including line breaks) within statements.

Pep 8 allows considerable flexibility regarding continued lines. The beautifier will leave all of the following unchanged, whether or not they conform to the pep 8 recommendation::

    def function1 (a, b, c):
        pass
    
    def function2 (
    a = 2, # a comment
    b = 3, # another comment
    ):
        pass
    
    def function3 (
        a = 2, # a comment
        b = 3, # another comment
    ):
        pass
    
    def function4(
                  a = 2, # a comment
                  b = 3, # another comment
                 ):
        pass

Similarly, the beautifier will not touch arguments in function calls.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20150603161559.1">``beautify-node``
    Beautifies the Python code in the selected node.
``beautify-tree``
    Beautifies all the Python code in the selected tree.
``beautify-c``
    Reformats all C code in the selected tree.
    
These commands skip any nodes for which @language python (or c) is not in effect.

The **Python beautifier** (beautify-tree and beautify-node) is *safe*.  It can never alter the meaning of a program because it compare the parse trees of the original and beautified code. The code remains unchanged if there is a mismatch. Such **beautifier errors** produce debugging dumps. Please report any such errors to Leo's developers.

The Python beautifier works only on syntactically correct code. It issues a warning and does nothing for syntactically incorrect code.

The Python beautifier converts **Leonine syntax** (directives, section references and @doc parts) to comments, possibly with a trailing ``pass`` statement.  Usually this produces syntactically correct text.  As discussed below, the trailing ``pass`` can create SyntaxError's.

The following sections describe how the beautify-tree and beautify-node commands work in more detail.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20150817125512.1">efc.compareTrees does most of the work of comparing two similar outlines.
For example, here is "@button compare vr-controller" in leoPluginsRef.leo::

    p1 = g.findNodeAnywhere(c, 'class ViewRenderedController (QWidget) (vr)')
    p2 = g.findNodeAnywhere(c, 'class ViewRenderedController (QWidget) (vr2)')
    assert p1 and p2
    tag = 'compare vr1 &amp; vr2'
    c.editFileCommands.compareTrees(p1, p2, tag)

This script will compare the trees whose roots are p1 and p2 and show the results like "Recovered nodes".  That is, the script creates a node called "compare vr1 &amp; vr2".  This top-level node contains one child node for every node that is different.  Each child node contains a diff of the node.  The grand children are one or two clones of the changed or inserted node.

<t tx="ekr.20150923111606.1">A new user recently said to me, "Leo is powerful and flexible--and complex and bewildering". This is true. I believe it is always the goal of developers to make their software less complex and bewildering but keep in mind that Leo has been in development for over 20 years...This puts it right up there with Vim and Emacs in terms of maturity. My own experience with Vim and Emacs have been quite similar to my experience with Leo. All three are powerful and flexible and complex and bewildering in their own right.

I believe with tools of this weight and impact, there will always be an investment in learning them. They're all vast forests of features filled with hidden treasures and in the case of each of them he/she that invests in the tool will be rewarded for their effort. It is, however, the responsibility of the community (led by the developers) to help make that treasure hunt as enjoyable and adventurous as possible, as any good treasure hunt should be. 

And this is where Leo does not falter, in the helpfulness of its community (small though it may be). I will reiterate what Edward has said many times, do not struggle on your own if you are lost, confused, or bewildered. Please ask questions. If the documentation or examples do not meet your needs, please ask questions. In my own experience as a once new user (though there may be the occasional disagreement) you will not be chided, scorned, or belittled but will be met with more even more help than you originally asked for. -- John Lunzer &lt;lunzer@gmail.com&gt;</t>

Some time ago there were a discussion about Leo in virtualenv.

Now I could test it in Python3, PyQt5 on Kubuntu:

Here are the steps (I worked in a folder with write permission '/leo'):

1. Install PyQt5 in the system:

sudo aptitude install python3-pyqt5

2. Create the virtual environment with the '--system-site-packages' switch and without pip (I've found this the only way, which worked):

pyvenv-3.4 --system-site-packages --without-pip py3-pyqt5

3. Install setuptools and pip into the created environment:

wget --no-check-certificate https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py -O ez_setup.py

py3-pyqt5/bin/python ez_setup.py --insecure

wget --no-check-certificate https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-6.0.8.tar.gz#md5=2332e6f97e75ded3bddde0ced01dbda3

tar xzvf pip-6.0.8.tar.gz

cd pip-6.0.8

../py3-pyqt5/bin/python setup.py install

cd ..

Now you can install what you want in the created environment, without affecting the system.

py3-pyqt5/bin/pip install Sphinx

4. From the leo-editor source folder launch Leo with the new interpreter:

In my case:

<t tx="ekr.20160304081437.5">Imo, git rivals python as the greatest productivity tool ever devised for programmers.

My workflow on Ubuntu and Windows is essentially identical. Simple aliases (Ubuntu) and .bat files (Windows) support the following console commands::

    gs  (expands to git status)
    gd (git diff)  Uses an external diff program,
                   but I'm starting to prefer text diffs.
    ga . (git add .)
    ga file (git add file)
    gc (git commit: configured to open Scite to create a commit message)
    gc -m "a one-line commit message"
    push (git push)

I use gitk on both platforms to review commits.

And that's about it. I use "git help" and "git help command" as needed.

<t tx="ekr.20160304081437.6">Running a unit test locally, without exiting Leo, saves a lots of time.  It's much faster than having to load unitTest.leo or even a small .leo file.

The question is, how to use the newest code?  imp.reload often doesn't work. But there is a trick that does work.  Clone the code under development and put it under an @test node.  The script in the @test node uses @others to gain access to the code, not an import.

For instance, here is the @test node I use to develop the new javascript importer::

    g.cls()
    p1 = p.copy()
    if c.isChanged():
        c.save()
    import leo.plugins.importers.basescanner as basescanner
    @others
    scanner = JavaScriptScanner(c.importCommands)
    h = '@ignore js-test'
    p = g.findNodeAnywhere(c, h)
    if p:
        while p.firstChild():
            p.firstChild().doDelete()
    else:
        p = c.insertHeadline()
        p.h = h
    c.selectPosition(p)
    fn = r'c:\prog\jQuery-short2.js'
    s = open(fn, 'r').read()
    print('Sources..\n\n%s\n\n' % s)
    scanner.scan(s, p)
    c.selectPosition(p1)
    c.redraw()
    print('done')

To repeat, the code under test is a child of this node, so the script uses @others to gain access to it.  It's super fast.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20160304081437.7">Leo is a superb tool for understanding, studying and organizing any kind of complex data, including computer programs. The first great Aha in Leo's history was that webs (literate programs) are outlines in disguise. Leo's importers (@auto) make it easy to studying other people's programs. Leo's always-present outline structure clarifies overall program structure and makes many kinds of comments unnecessary.

Leo is also a superb browser for code and data. Unlike many other folding editors, Leo remembers which nodes were expanded when you last saved an outline. This is surprisingly important. And Leo's clones let you organize any data as you want, even if all folds are collapsed.

Leo is a uniquely powerful scripting environment. This power comes from three sources: Leo's API, Leo's ability to compose scripts from outlines and Leo's underlying data structure, a Directed Acyclic Graph, the basis for Leo's clones.

Leo's API consists primarily of generators, such as c.all_positions(), p.self_and_subtree(), etc. and properties, such as p.b, p.h, p.gnx and p.v.u.  Leo's API makes it trivial to write scripts to access or change any node. AFAIK, these capabilities are unique.  Simulating them in vim or Emacs is possible, but so is simulating Python's capabilities in C...

Afaik, no other scripting environment allows you to compose scripts from outlines.  @file, @clean, @auto, @others and section references and definitions make this possible.  Section references and definitions are modeled on the noweb language, but all of Leo's script composition features are fully integrated into Leo's outline structure.

Leo's outline nodes have headlines (p.h) and body text (p.b) and extensible information (p.v.u).  Headlines are descriptions (meta-data) of the data in p.b and p.v.u.  Scripts can rapidly discover and categorize data using metadata.  Leo's @ convention for headlines (@clean, @file, @auto, @html, etc.) show how extensible this node typing is.

So much for the theory.  The following also are important in practice:

- Native scripting in Python, with full access to all of Leo's sources.
- Leo's plugin architecture.
- Leo's rst3 command, vim, xemacs and ILeo (IPython bridge), and leoBridge module.
- Leo's minibuffer commands, borrowed shamelessly from Emacs.
- @test and @suite: Leo's outline-oriented unit testing framework.
- @button: bringing scripts to data.
- Leo's outline-oriented directives.

The invention/discovery of @clean earlier this year completes Leo is some sense.

Acknowledgements: Working with Leo's community of Leo's developers and users has been a great pleasure for over 20 years. My only regret is that Bernhard Mulder and Bob Fitzwater are no longer with us. Both made essential contributions. Bob Fitzwater was my mentor. He gently pushed me to consider design, not just "bit twiddling".  Bernhard Mulder contributed two of the most important elements of Leo: Leo's traversers (generators) and the original @shadow algorithm.  Neither @clean nor the revised Mulder/Ream algorithm could possibly have happened without him.  I miss both these great thinkers.  Both would have been proud of what they helped create.

A successful software tool is one that was used to do something undreamed of by its author.' -- Stephen Johnson

Leo is a wild success on this score. I foresaw none of these developments 20 years ago:  Leo's minibuffer, @button, @test, @auto, @clean, Leo's plugin architecture, the rst3 command, the Leo bridge and the IPython bridge.  Surely many other features and uses could be added. None of these would have happened without Leo's community of brilliant people. These features create the Leonine world.  Who knows what will be the result...

<t tx="ekr.20160304081437.8">This idea of an always-present outline has been key to me for organizing writings. Some coworkers have found in the past that this helps them when we're correcting their text.

&gt; Leo's clones let you organize any data as you want, even if all folds are collapsed.

For me this is the most powerful but misunderstood feature of Leo. Most of the people which compares it with other IDE rant about why Leo doesn't works more automatically imposing structure, but in Leo you're in charge. You impose infrastructure...

For me the second main insight of Leo (besides emergent always present tree structure on almost any file) was to have a tree that is a programmable structure that can be understood and changed by any node inside that tree. I think that Leo brings structure and self-referentiality to the dumb flat file word. So you can create a tree from one (or several) files, deconstruct and reconstruct it they way you want and automatize the way in behaves and talks with the external world...The more I start to focus on interactive writing and going away of the unix inspired OS world, the more the second insight become important to me. I didn't need to deconstruct/reconstruct or impose structure over flat files but to use outlining for structure thought by (interactive) writing and I need the outline be a fully programmable object. That's the essence of most of my Leo experience...

Thanks for Leo and all the key inspiration it brings. And, as always, thanks to the Leo community for the food for thought.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20160304081437.9">My only input is what makes Leo so special to me.

After learning just a few things about Leo, and after replacing section references mostly with @others, writing code becomes a game rather than a chore.

As soon as an idea becomes complicated, I add a new @others, and break down the complication into chunks until all the complications are now simple.

I'll typically clone that section an the bottom of the outline, then add enough logic at a parent level so that the complication can be tested with control B.

This is my backward implementation of unit testing. This kind of 'unit testing' never has to be refactored when the code is (invariably) improved.

The cloned 'test piece' can be relegated to a testing section, and the new chunks subsequently cloned into whatever structure make real sense for the project.

In practice, this is just fun for me.

Coding without Leo is not really fun any more. I recently finished a c++ socket server using Microsoft's Visual Studio, in concert with someone who didn't have Leo. Microsoft's tools are great, and the project went off without a hitch, but the fun was just plain gone.

Anyway, thanks for the great perspective on Leo.

<t tx="ekr.20160309092522.1">The name "Stupendous Aha" is a bit ironical.  From one point of view it may seem obvious. Nevertheless, it was a true Aha for me.

Unit tests permanent check of the correctness of a piece of code. Test Driven Development expands this view. But unit tests are much more important.  In fact, unit tests are *general-purpose helper scripts* that can be run at any time.

1. Unit tests codify and make explicit desired or expected behavior.

2. Unit tests are a way of "maintaining attention" on a problem.  Unit tests don't forget, and they are permanent.

3. Unit tests *do whatever we want*, and they do it automatically.

In short, unit tests are a *master tool* for any programmer or designer.

Leo's @test nodes are one way to run unit tests.  You can also use @button to encapsulate your tests.  After running an @button script, you can quickly re-run @button scripts with Ctrl-P, repeat-complex-command.

<t tx="ekr.20160318142213.1">Installing PyQt on MacOS using::

    brew install qt sip pyqt
    
may not always work.  In that case, you will see something like this when running Leo::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "launchLeo.py", line 8, in
    leo.core.runLeo.run()
    [Snip]
    File "/Users/your-name/git/leo-editor/leo/plugins/qt_text.py",
    line 434, in class LeoLineTextWidget(QtWidgets.QFrame):
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'QFrame'
    
You can verify that PyQt has not been installed by setting the trace switch to True in leoQt.py. This will trace the import commands related to Qt and tell you exactly what is happening.

One Leo user gives this advice:

For anyone with similar problem the homebrew instruction for adding PyQT to the import path are wrong. Instead edit ~/.bash_profile and add this line::
    
    export PATH="/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:${PATH}"
    
After this leo editor will open with using the default python installation provided by MacOS.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20160410043905.1">Within @path and @&lt;file&gt; paths, Leo evaluates ``{{exp}}`` with the the following symbols defined: ``c``, ``g``, ``p``, ``os`` and ``sys``. Also, ``sep`` is defined as os.sep.
File names are relative to the directory containing the .leo file, but that can be overridden, depending on the form of the file name. For example::

    @file {{c.config.getString('my-dir')}}{{sep}}myFile.py

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20160410044518.1">.. index::
    pair: @nosent; Reference

The @nosent directive creates an external file **without** sentinels. When writing
@nosent trees, Leo expands section references and @all and @others directives.  Because the external file contains no sentinels, @nosent trees can not be updated from changes made outside of Leo. If you want this capability, use @clean instead.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20160410045234.1">When importing files into @auto trees, Leo performs several checks to ensure that writing the imported file will produce exactly the same file. These checks can produces **errors** or **warnings**. Errors indicate a potentially serious problem. Leo inserts an @ignore directive in the @auto tree if any error is found. This prevents the @auto tree from modifying the external file.

.. index::
    pair: Strict language; Reference

Before importing a file, Leo **regularizes** the leading whitespace of all lines of the original source file. That is, Leo converts blanks to tabs or tabs to blanks depending on the value of the @tabwidth directive in effect for the @auto node. Leo also checks that the indentation of any non-blank line is a multiple of the indentation specified by the @tabwidth directive. **Strict languages** are languages such as Python for which leading whitespace must be preserved exactly as it appears in the original source file. Problems during regularizing whitespace generate errors for strict languages and warnings for non-strict languages.

After importing a file, Leo verifies that writing the @auto node would create the same file as the original file. Such file comparison mismatches generate errors unless the problem involves only leading whitespace for non-strict languages. Whenever a mismatch occurs the first non-matching line is printed.

File comparison mismatches can arise for several reasons:

1. Bugs in the import parsers. Please report any such bugs immediately.

2. Underindented lines in classes, methods or function.

.. index::
    pair: Underindented line; Reference

An **underindented line** is a line of body text that is indented less then the starting line of the class, method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not represent such lines exactly: every line in an external file will have at least the indentation of any unindented line of the corresponding node in the outline. Leo will issue a warning (not an error) for underindented Python comment lines. Such lines can not change the meaning of Python programs.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20160410103017.1">**Section names** have the form::

    &lt;&lt; any text, except double closing angle brackets &gt;&gt;
    
**Section-definition nodes** have headlines starting with a section name.

Leo performs **expansions** for all @&lt;file&gt; nodes except @asis.

Expansion of @all:

- Leo replaces @all by the *unexpanded* body text of *all* nodes.

Expansion of section names and @others:

- Leo replaces section names in body text by the *expanded*
  text of the corresponding section definition node.
  
- Leo replaces @others with the *expanded* text of all nodes
  that *aren't* section-definition nodes.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20160414191631.1">A frequently requested feature is for clones that don't share children. The typical use case is to gather data from one place to be used in another. For instance, we might want to document a function by special-cloning only its node excluding its children. A **gathering script** can provide most of the benefits of detached clone:

1. The script has complete flexibility to find a desired positions anywhere, including other .leo files.  This moots the need for cross-file clones.

2. For any gathered position p, the script has complete flexibility to make available p.h, p.b or p.children, depending on the needs of the script.

For example, a documentation script might "scrape" one or more .leo files for data, and then create nodes that reference the scraped data.


</t>
<t tx="ekr.20160415031743.21">Start your file with::

    '''
    &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    '''

The &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt; section can just contain::

    @language rest # or md
    @wrap
    @others

This allows the "interior" of the docstring to be colored using rST (or markdown).
The children of the &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt; node form the actual docstring. No section names are required!

This pattern organizes large docstrings in a Leonine way. The only drawback is that the actual external file contains sentinel lines separating the parts of the docstring. In practice, it's no big deal, especially if each child starts with a blank line.

<t tx="ekr.20161014160238.1">Leo uses constants and functions defined in leoGlobals.py to ensure that Leo's code works on both Python 2.7+ and Python 3.x.

- g.isPython3: True if Leo is running Python 3.x.  False otherwise.
 
You should be particularly aware of:

- g.isBytes, g.isInt, g.isString, g.isUnicode.
- g.toUnicode, g.toEncodedString, g.isValidEncoding.
- g.u, g.ue.

If you use the above methods there should never be a need for direct calls to unicode(s), encode(s) or decode(s).  The above methods are clearer, safer, and do better error checking and recovery.

A few other functions should be on your radar:

- g.readFileIntoEncodedString
- s, e = g.readFileIntoString
- g.stripBOM

There may be cases where direct tests against g.isPython3 seem the clearest. That's fine, but usually you can avoid direct tests.

**Important**: g.u and g.toUnicode are not always interchangeable. You should always use g.u to convert Qt QStrings to unicode. Here is an example from quicksearch.py::

    t = g.u(self.ui.lineEdit.text())

Similarly, use g.ue to convert Qt bytes to unicode. Here is an example from LM.openZipFile::

    s = theFile.read(name)
    if g.isPython3:
        s = g.ue(s, 'utf-8')
    return StringIO(s)

Actually, the above code is dubious, because it will break if the mode of the open command changes.

**Note**: Leo's code sometimes does s = g.u('aString'), but this isn't needed since Python 2.7 which supports unicode literals.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20161020064204.1">``flake8``
    Run flake8 on all nodes of the selected tree, or the first ancestor @&lt;file&gt; node.
``pyflakes``
    Runs pyflakes on the Python source files in the selected tree, or the first ancestor @&lt;file&gt; node. Prints results in the console window and Leo's log pane.
``pylint``
    Runs pylint on the Python source files in the selected tree, or the first ancestor @&lt;file&gt; node. This command is also available from the popup menus created by the contextmenu plugin.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20161020064436.1">``check-derived-file``
    Makes sure an external file written by Leo can be read properly. 
``check-leo-file``
    Performs a full check of the consistency of a .leo file.  As of Leo 5.1, Leo performs checks of gnx's and outline structure before writes and after reads, pastes and undo/redo.
``check-outline``
    Checks the outline for consistency. Leo automatically checks the syntax of Python external files when Leo writes the external file.
``clear-all-caches``
    Clear all file caches in g.app.leoHomeDir/db
``clear-cache``
    Clear the outline's file cache.
``escape``
    Enter watch escape mode.
``pdb``
    Drops into debugger, in the middle of the command-handling logic. Get the commander by stepping out into k.masterKeyHandler or k.masterCommandHandler. Using c, one can then get all other info.
``print-buttons``
    Print all @button and @command commands, their bindings and their source.

<t tx="ekr.20161207052511.1">Let us think of lessons not as explanations, but as puzzles to be solved by the student. The puzzles themselves need no lengthy explanations. They can even be cryptic. This attitude arises from two principles:

1. The less said, the better.
2. Invite people to learn for themselves.

**Pick something that interests you**

Pick a real, worthy, programming task that you (the student) personally want/need to do in Leo. *This step is essential*! It is *useless* to try to learn in a vacuum.

EKR's first python program was C2Py. leoAttic.txt contains the original version. Leo's c-to-python commands contained revised code.

**Overcome fear of crashes and mistakes**

- Run Leo from a console.
- Single-step through your code with g.pdb()
- Deliberately put a crasher in your code and see what happens.

The only way to hard crash Leo is to pass bad pointers to PyQt. Python should catch all other problems. If it doesn't, report a bug to the python people ;-)

**Discover how Leo's code works**

- Where is Leo's source code? Hint: look for leoPy.leo in LeoDocs.leo.
- Look at Leo's demote command.
  - What are three ways of finding the demote command?
  - How does demote change the outline?
  - How does demote handle undo?
- Study any other Leo command that relates to your project.
- Use the cff command to find all definitions of x.
- Use the cff command to find all uses of x.

**Start using Leo for real**

- Add a new command using @button.
- Create an external file containing your real-world project.
  Execute it outside of Leo.
- Write a Leo plugin.
- Advanced: fix one of Leo's bugs.

**Attitude**

Students should always feel free to ask for help, but struggle teaches us the most. **It doesn't matter how long it takes to learn something**. In our culture, we value quickness. But that is a trap. All learning builds momentum:

- Put 10 units of effort in, get 1 unit of results out.
- Put 1 in, get 1 out.
- Put 1 in, get 10 out.

There is no other way! How many times have we given up just because things were not easy or clear at first?

**That which we learn, we learn by doing**

Reading about (and thinking about) are useful, but not good enough. That is why students must have a project that is important to them.  The project will put them into action.</t>

leoApp.py now contains the IdleTimeManager (ITM) class, with a singleton instance, g.app.idleTimeManager. This class handles all details of running code at idle time, including running 'idle' hooks.

The new encapsulation has simplified code all over Leo:

- ITM ivars replace several LeoApp ivars.
- LM.load now calls g.app.idleTimeManager.start() to start idle-time processing, leaving all the details to the ITM class.
- The g.idle time functions in leoGlobals.py now simply set g.app.idle_time_hooks_enabled.
  This is the only other remaining LeoApp ivar pertaining to idle-time processing.
- To schedule code for running at idle time, code calls g.app.idleTimeManager.add_callback(callback).

**Details**

leoApp.py:
- ITM.on_idle now handles idle-hooks.
- Removed g.app.idle_timer.
- 'idle' hooks called if and only if g.app.idle_time_hooks_enabled is True.
- Only one timer is ever started by Leo: g.app.idle_time_manager_timer.

The singleton g.app.backgroundProcessManager instance of the BackgroundProcessManager (BPM) class handles all details of running separate processes in the background without blocking Leo.

The BPM manages a queue of background processes, and runs them one after another in the background.  It registers a handler with the IdleTimeManager that checks to see if the presently running background process has completed.  If so, it writes its output to the log and starts another background process in the queue.

Because only one background process from the queue is ever running, the background processes can write their output to Leo's log without the output becoming intermixed.

You can kill all processes by calling BPM.kill(). That's what kill-pylint does.  You can add processes to the queue at any time.  For example, you can rerun the pylint command while a background process is running.

The BackgroundProcessManager is completely safe: all of its code runs in the main process.

Leo's markdown importer converts all sections to use '#' markup. The technical justification appears at the bottom of the page for #342. The rest of this post explains the change from a user's point of view.

tl;dr: Converting all sections to '#' markup is Leonine, simplest and best. Only existing .md files that Leo didn't write could be changed.  If such changes don't work for you, just insert @ignore yourself when git or diff reports differences.

Imo, this change is fully justified:

1. It is more Leonine.

When creating and changing .md files from within Leo, @auto-md works much more smoothly.  Indeed, as I have just verified, converting an @nosent x.md file to @auto-md x.md "just works".

There is absolutely no reason to use underlined sections when using Leo.  The headlines proclaim the section structure far better than flat text of any kind, whether ### section name or underlined section names.

2. Perfect import check should not wag the dog.

The markdown importer is one of the simplest of all.  The possibility of dropping data seems remote.  Requiring a typical perfect import check to pass would preclude regularizing section markup.  It's just that simple.

Furthermore, the existing unit tests for the markup importer do check imported section structure, albeit imperfectly That should suffice for now. In the unlikely event that real problems are reported, these after-the-fact unit tests can be improved.

**Summary**

Importing markdown files containing underlined sections could only pass typical perfect import checks if existing underlining were somehow retained.  That's a bad idea.  Instead, Leo's markdown importer now implicitly converts all sections to '#' markup.  In essence, the markup disappears from the outline, to be automagically reinserted when Leo writes the outline.

This new scheme can change existing .md files, but only files that Leo didn't write.  If that is inconvenient for you, just add @ignore yourself.

- Fixes #273: Qt Bug involving large text nodes.

- Revolutionizes Leo's approach to Qt's QSyntaxHighlighter class.  Everything happens automatically. When changing nodes, Leo need only re-init the underlying jEdit colorizing code so that the proper language is colorized. 

No need for any of the interface in the ColorizerMixin class.  No need to "lock out" coloring: it happens automatically whenever Leo's body pane changes! Heh.  As I write this I see that colorizer.colorize is no longer ever called!

I don't think I have ever misunderstood a class as badly as I have misunderstood QSyntaxHighlighter class.  Set up and used properly, it is an amazing helper. To be fair, Leo uses this class in a very unusual manner. The mistake I made was subtle, and the Qt documents don't warn against it.

The performance bug created by calling QSyntaxHighlighter explicitly caused a "series of unfortunate events" ;-) Seeing the speed pyzo's pure python syntax colorer was the key breakthrough.

[Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) 5.5 is now available on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor).

Leo is an IDE, outliner and PIM, as described [here](http://leoeditor.com/preface.html).

Simulating Leo's features in Vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible, just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...

**The highlights of Leo 5.5**

- Syntax coloring is 20x faster than before.
  The "big-text" hack is no longer needed.
- Leo's importers are now line/token oriented, allowing them
  to handle languages like javascript more robustly.
- New perl and javascript importers.
- Pylint now runs in the background.
- Pyflakes can optionally check each file as it is written.
- Greatly simplified argument-handling for interactive commands.
- Documented how to do Test-Driven Development in Leo.

Here is the docstring for `k.get1Arg`, which also discusses `k.getNextArg`:

k.get1Arg: Handle the next character the user types when accumulating a user argument from the minibuffer. Ctrl-G will abort this processing at any time.

Commands should use k.get1Arg to get the first minibuffer argument and k.getNextArg to get all other arguments.

Before going into the many details, let's look at some examples. This code will work in any class having a 'c' ivar bound to a commander.
    
**Example 1**: get one argument from the user:
    
    @cmd('my-command')
    def myCommand(self, event):
        k = self.c.k
        k.setLabelBlue('prompt: ')
        k.get1Arg(event, handler=self.myCommand1)
            
    def myCommand1(self, event):
        k = self.c.k
        # k.arg contains the argument.
        # Finish the command.
        ...
        # Reset the minibuffer.
        k.clearState()
        k.resetLabel()
        k.showStateAndMode()
        
**Example 2**: get two arguments from the user:
    
    @cmd('my-command')
    def myCommand(self, event):
        k = self.c.k
        k.setLabelBlue('first prompt: ')
        k.get1Arg(event, handler=self.myCommand1)
            
    def myCommand1(self, event):
        k = self.c.k
        self.arg1 = k.arg
        k.setLabelBlue('second prompt: ')
        k.getNextArg(handler=self.myCommand2)
        
    def myCommand2(self, event):
        k = self.c.k
        # k.arg contains second argument.
        # Finish the command, using self.arg1 and k.arg.
        ...
        # Reset the minibuffer.
        k.clearState()
        k.resetLabel()
        k.showStateAndMode()
        
k.get1Arg and k.getNextArg are a convenience methods. They simply pass their arguments to the get_arg method of the singleton GetArg instance. This docstring describes k.get1arg and k.getNextArg as if they were the corresponding methods of the GetArg class.

k.get1Arg is a state machine. Logically, states are tuples (kind, n, handler) though they aren't represented that way. When the state machine in the GetArg class is active, the kind is 'getArg'. This constant has special meaning to Leo's key-handling code.

The arguments to k.get1Arg are as follows:

event:              The event passed to the command.

handler=None,       An executable. k.get1arg calls handler(event)
                    when the user completes the argument by typing
                    &lt;Return&gt; or (sometimes) &lt;tab&gt;.

tabList=[]:         A list of possible completions.

completion=True:    True if completions are enabled.

oneCharacter=False: True if k.arg should be a single character.

stroke=None:        The incoming key stroke.

useMinibuffer=True: True: put focus in the minibuffer while accumulating arguments.
                    False allows sort-lines, for example, to show the selection range.

The problem:

abbrev.init_tree_abbrev changes the outline's changed indicator (*) during startup.
Simply reversing this in c.new causes the * to flip back and forth.

The changes were a bit tricky:
    
- init_tree_abbrev calls c.pasteOutline(...,redrawFlag=False)
- pasteOutline calls c.setChanged(True, redrawFlag=redrawFlag)
- c.new calls c.setChanged(False)
- Added redrawFlag keyword arg to c.setChanged.
  When this is false, c.setChanged does not alter the outline's changed indicator.
  
Suppressing the change indicator is a bit dangerous.
It could be very confusing if the indicator gets out of sync with reality.
But the fix should actually be safe enough, because only startup code is affected.

<t tx="ekr.20170206073747.5">*Important*: Leo's binary Windows installer sets file associations
automatically, so this section is needed only if you are installing Leo
from a .zip file or other sources.

There are two ways of associating .leo files with Leo. The first uses the
Windows control panel, the second, the Windows console.

**Method 1: Using the Windows Control Panel**

The goal is that you want to associate .leo files with the following command::

    "&lt;path to python&gt;\python.exe" "&lt;path to launchLeo.py&gt;\launchLeo.py" "%1"
    
Before Windows 7, you do this with using the Folder Options control panel.
In Windows 7, you do this with the Default Programs control panel.

*Note*: "%1" passes just the file being clicked on, quoted for spaces etc.
The quotation marks are needed to handle file paths containing spaces.

*Warning:* In a batch file, %1 passes just the first command line parameter.
It is logical to expect %* to work for file associations just as in batch
files. Alas, it does not.

**Method 2: Using the Windows Console**

Open a Windows console with administrator privileges, then type::

    ftype LeoFile="&lt;path to python&gt;\pythonw.exe" "&lt;path to launchLeo.py&gt;\launchLeo.py" "%1" %*
    assoc .leo=LeoFile

And put this leo.bat in %PATH%::

    @start /b "Leo" "&lt;path to python&gt;\python.exe" "&lt;path to launchLeo.py&gt;\launchLeo.py" %*
    
You may omit the /b option if you want to create a separate console window for Leo.

Many thanks to Ludwig Schwardt for the following installation instructions. Using the HomeBrew installation method is *much* easier than before.

**Note from EKR**: When upgrading MacOS, it's probably a good idea to uninstall pyqt, sip and qt first::

    brew remove pyqt sip qt
    brew install qt sip pyqt

I (Ludwig) recently received a new MacBook Pro and did a fresh upgrade to Mac OS 10.7 (Lion). I then used the opportunity to test out installation procedures of various software on a clean system. My main finding is that the excellent Homebrew (mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) makes things much easier these days.

Why Homebrew? It does not try to replace every single bit of functionality on your Mac with their own version, like Macports or fink. It reuses the existing libraries as far as possible. No need to reinstall Python, for example (one of my pet gripes when people try to install new software on their Macs, and the source of much confusion and pain). It installs to /usr/local, the standard place to find third-party libraries and headers, instead of the obscure /opt or /sw. It's simple to use and to extend.

Here is my installation write-up:

- Read the Homebrew installation instructions at http://brew.sh/

- Make sure you have Xcode installed (test it by confirming that "gcc" runs in the Terminal). Only the smaller command-line tools are required; there is no need to get the full Xcode beast.

- In preparation for Homebrew, the best option in my opinion is to delete /usr/local via::

    sudo rm -rf /usr/local

  and install any software in it via HomeBrew instead.
  
  The HomeBrew package manager is so easy to use that you will find replacing deleted packages a snap.
  
  If deleting /usr/local fills you with dread (you do not want to lose your beloved third-party software), the second-best option is to make sure you have write permission for the directory via::

    sudo chown -R &lt;your user name&gt;:admin /usr/local

  If you don't know your username, run "whoami". :-) This is useful because homebrew actually discourages you from installing third-party software as the superuser (the usual Mac apps in /Applications are also installed as the normal user, for that matter).

- Install Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) by running the
  following command in the Terminal::
    
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

- Run "brew doctor" and check any further suggestions to improve your system.

  EKR note: I thought I had installed command-line tools after installing the XCode page. I hadn't, and "brew doctor" told me so.

- Run "brew update" to get the latest formulas

- Install sip and note the caveat::

    brew install sip

  This warns you to add the local python directory to your PYTHONPATH.
  Make a note of what this is (especially if you are not on Lion!).

- Add the following lines to your ~/.bash_profile
  (or ~/.profile on Leopard). This is the default for LION::

      export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
      # This is for SIP (and PyQt) as suggested by Homebrew
      export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

- Install PyQt::

    brew install pyqt
 
- Open a new Terminal tab / window so that the above settings take effect, and install Leo. I downloaded the Leo-4.9-final-a.zip, unzipped it, and ran "python launchLeo.py" inside the Leo directory.

It would really be great to get a Leo formula going for Homebrew. As mentioned before, the main question is just where to place all the Leo files in the /usr/local hierarchy.

Leo is a `full-featured outliner`_, with commands to insert, delete, move, hoist, promote and demote nodes.

**Clones** are a unique feature of Leo. Any outline node may be cloned. Cloned nodes are actually the *same* node, but they appear in different places in the outline. Changes to any clone affect all other clones of that node, *including their descendants*. For example, suppose the A` nodes are clones of each other::

    - A`
        - B
        - C
    - D
    - A`
        - B
        - C
        
Moving C right gives this outline::

    - A`
        - B
            - C
    - D
    - A`
        - B
            - C
            
.. _`clone-find commands`:
            
Clones allow you to create multiple views of data within a single outline. For example, Leo's `clone-find commands`_ create clones of all found nodes, moving the newly-created clones so they are all children of an **organizer node** describing the search. The organizer node is a new view of the outline's data, one focused on the found nodes!

.. _`Emacs minibuffer`: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minibuffer.html 

Leo has hundreds of commands, described in `Leo's Command Reference`_. **Very important**: You can (and should) ignore most of these commands at first. You execute commands using `key bindings`_ or *by name* in `Leo's minibuffer`_, similar to the `Emacs minibuffer`_.

You could type the full command name in the minibuffer, followed by the ``&lt;Return&gt;`` key to invoke the command, but that would be *way* too much work. Instead, you should use **typing completion** to avoid most typing. For example, you can execute the sort-lines commands this way::

    &lt;Alt-X&gt;so&lt;Tab&gt;
    
Now the minibuffer will list common prefix of all commands that start with "so", namely::

    sort-
    
After typing l&lt;Tab&gt; the minibuffer will contain::

    sort-lines
    
Now, just type &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command.  Typing completion quickly becomes second nature.

**Very important**: There is no need to remember the exact names of Leo’s commands. Instead, you only need to remember a few common command prefixes, such as::

    clone-find  clone-find commands
    file-       file commands
    find-       find commands
    isearch-    incremental search commands
    leo-        open .leo files
    open-       open files or url's
    print-      print commands
    sort-       sort commands
    toggle-     toggle settings commands
    
The following commands pertain to the minibuffer itself:
    
``Alt-X (full-command)``
    Executes any other command by typing its full name.
    
``Ctrl-P (repeat-complex-command``
    Repeats the last command entered by name in the minibuffer.
    
When in the minibuffer, the following keys are treated in special ways:

``&lt;Return&gt;``
    Executes the command.

``&lt;Tab&gt;``
    Shows all valid completions.

``&lt;BackSpace&gt;``
    Shows more completions.
    
``Ctrl-G``
    Exits the minibuffer and puts focus in the body pane.
    
``UpArrow``
    Moves backward through command history. The first ``UpArrow`` is the same as ``Ctrl-P``.

``DownArrow``
    Moves forward through command history.

<t tx="ekr.20170217093636.1">.. in tutorial-basics.html (Scripting basics)

Leo's markup applies to scripts as well as external files. Leo's execute-script command **composes** the script from the selected node, using Leo's markup. For example: this body text defines the top-level part of a script::

    '''My script'''
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    class Controller:
        # Child nodes define the methods of this class.
        @others
    Controller(c).run # c *is* defined.

**Important**: Leo recognizes section references *everywhere*, even inside strings or comments. See `this FAQ entry &lt;FAQ.html#what-about-code-that-looks-like-a-section-reference&gt;`_.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170217093639.1">.. _`commander`: tutorial-basics.html#accessing-outline-data
.. _`position`: tutorial-scripting.html#positions-and-vnodes

The execute-script command pre-defines three names: c, g, and p. **c** is the `commander`_ of the outline in which the script executes. **g** is the ``leo.core.leoGlobals`` module, containing dozens of useful functions and classes.  **p** is the `position`_ of the presently selected node.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170217093640.1">The **Commander class** defines both a scripting API and a DOM (Document Object Module) giving *complete* access to all data in an outline.  For example::

    '''
        Print all headlines of the outline, properly indented,
        with the number of characters in each node's body text.
    '''
    # c.all_positions() is a python generator yielding all positions, in outline order.
    for p in c.all_positions():
        print('%3s %s %s' % (
            len(p.b),       # p.b is p's body text.
            ' '*p.level(),  # p.level() is p's indentation level.
            p.h,            # p.h is p's headline.

**@command nodes** define a command. Running the command runs a script that can be applied to any outline node. That is, p is bound to the presently selected node, *not* the @button node. **@button nodes** work the same way, and in addition create a button in the icon area. Pressing that button runs the command. For example, this node defines the print-tree command bound to Ctrl-9::

    @command print-tree @key=Ctrl-9 # in the headline
    
    '''
        Print all headlines of the selected subtree, properly indented,
        with the number of characters in each node's body text.

.. index::
    pair: @test Node; Tutorial</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170217093640.3">**@test nodes** create unit tests. @test nodes automatically convert the body to a subclass of unittest.TestCase. Run these tests with one of Leo's ``run-unit-test-`` commands. ``&lt;Alt-X&gt;run&lt;tab&gt;`` gives the full list. Here one of Leo's actual unit tests::

    @test c.positionExists for all nodes # In the headline

    for p in c.all_positions():
        assert c.positionExists(p)
    
Within @test nodes, c, g, and p are predefined as usual. In addition, **self** is the instance of unittest.TestCase created by the @test node. For example::
  
    self.assertTrue(g)
    
For more details, see `Leo's unit-testing reference &lt;unitTesting.html&gt;`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170217093641.1">**Autocompletion** reminds you of all members (functions, methods, ivars, etc.) contained in objects in Leo's source code, and in Python's standard library modules. ``Alt-1 (toggle-autocompleter)`` enables and disables autocompletion. **Note**: Autocompletion can be enabled only when @language python is in effect.

For example, typing just "c.atF" (in the body pane, with autocompletion enabled) automatically inserts "c.atFileCommands" into the body pane, because "c.atFileCommands" is the only possible completion of "c.atF".

As another example, typing "at.writeA" will show (in an autocompleter tab in the Log pane) all of the write commands in leoAtFile.py::

    writeAll:method
    writeAllHelper:method
    writeAtAutoNodes:method
    writeAtAutoNodesHelper:method
    writeAtShadowNodes:method
    writeAtShadowNodesHelper:method

When a single completion is shown, typing '?' will show the docstring for a method. For example, "c.atFileCommands.write?" shows::

    Write a 4.x derived file.
    root is the position of an @&lt;file&gt; node
    
**Calltips** show the expected arguments to functions and methods. ``Alt-2 (toggle-calltips)`` enables and disables calltips. ``(`` shows calltips, when @language python is in effect.
``&lt;Return&gt;`` or ``Ctrl-G (keyboard-quit)`` exits calltips. Calltips work for any Python function or method, including Python's global functions. Examples::

    g.toUnicode(            g.toUnicode(s, encoding, reportErrors=False
    c.widgetWantsFocusNow(  c.widgetWantsFocusNow(w

<t tx="ekr.20170219074525.1">All of Leo's generators yielding positions automatically yield copies of those positions. The following works as expected::

    aList = [p for p in c.all_positions()]

There is no longer any need to do this::

    aList = [p.copy() for p in c.all_positions()]

Of course, copied positions will typically become invalid when the outline changes, so some care is needed.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170219074554.1">Leo's core code now uses None instead of c.nullPosition(). c.p can be None during startup, which necessitated a few new guards. As a result, the following are all valid tests:

    if not p:        # Correct, pre-Leo 5.5.
    if not p.v:      # Correct, pre-Leo 5.5
    if p is not None # Correct, Leo 5.5 and later.
    if p is None:    # Correct, Leo 5.5 and later.

Now that these tests "just work", there is no need to document them in the scripting tutorial.

Most changed methods are in the startup logic:
    
    *.injectIvars
    c.redraw
    NullTree.edit_widget
    QtStatusLineClass.update
    
And a few others:

<t tx="ekr.20170228101933.10">@language rest

Added g.findRootWithPredicate, an important helper. Used it to greatly rst.processTopTree, pyflakes.run, and pylint.run. This improves the rst3 command

Leo's pyflakes and pylint commands can be applied to files that depend on the presently selected node.  They first search down c.p's tree, then up the tree, looking for @&lt;file&gt; nodes.  If no nodes are found, and c.p is a clone, these commands expand the search to the entire tree, looking for an @&lt;file&gt; node that has c.p in its tree.

g.findRootWithPredicate now formalizes and regularizes this search process.  For example:
    
@language python

    def predicate(p):
        return p.isAnyAtFileNode() and p.h.strip().endswith('.py')
       
    roots = g.findRootsWithPredicate(c, root, predicate)
    
@language rest

I added this helper because the rst3 command was not as clever as the pylint and pyflakes commands in this regard.  Now it is. It would have been unbearable to repeat the pylint/pyflakes code one more time...

Here is g.findRootWithPredicate:

@language python

def findRootsWithPredicate(c, root, predicate):
    '''
    Commands often want to find one or more **roots**, given a position p.
    A root is the position of any node matching a predicate.
   
    This function formalizes the search order used by the pylint, pyflakes and
    the rst3 commands, returning a list of zero or more found roots.
    '''
    roots = set()
    # 1. Search p's tree.
    for p in root.self_and_subtree():
        if predicate(p):
            roots.add(p.copy())
    if roots:
        return list(roots)
    # 2. Look up the tree.
    for p in root.parents():
        if predicate(p):
            return [p.copy()]
    # 3. Expand the search if root is a clone.
    clones = []
    for p in root.self_and_parents():
        if p.isCloned():
            clones.append(p.v)
    if clones:
        for p in c.all_positions():
            if predicate(p):
                # Match if any node in p's tree matches any clone.
                for p2 in p.self_and_subtree():
                    if p2.v in clones:
                        return [p.copy()]

<t tx="ekr.20170228103914.1">Q: When can I delete a clone safely?

A: Any time! The only time you can "lose" data is when you delete a non-cloned node, save your work and exit Leo.

Q: What gets "lost" when I delete a non-cloned node?

A: The node, and all it's non-cloned children. In addition, if the node contains all clones of a cloned node, all copies of the cloned node will also be "lost".

Q: Anything else I should be careful about concerning clones?

Not really.  If you move any node out "underneath" an @file (@clean, etc) node, the contents of that node disappears from the external file.

I hope this encourages more people to use clones.  Leo's clone-find commands are something that every Leo programmers should be using every day.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20170228112643.1">**Decluttering** replaces controls custom formatting of headlines, including:

- Hiding or changing headline text,
- Adding icons to headlines,
- Changing the styling of headlines.

Decluttering is *inactive* when you are editing a headline.

Decluttering is *completely optional*. To enable decluttering, use::

     @bool tree-declutter = True
     
Decluttering is controlled by **decluttering rulesets**.
You specify decluttering rulesets in the body text of::
     
    @data tree-declutter-patterns
    
As usual with @data nodes:

- Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
- You may organize the text of the @data node using child nodes.

Each ruleset consists of a list of lines:

- The first line is a **rule line**, containing a **find pattern**.
- The second line is a **replacement line**.
- The ruleset ends with zero or more **style lines**.

Find patterns are `regular expressions &lt;https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html&gt;`_.
Decluttering affects only those headlines that match a rule pattern. 

The following section shows some example rulesets. Later sections discuss decluttering commands, patterns and styles in more detail.

add @cmd justify-toggle-auto and @bool autojustify-on-at-start

The @int autojustify behavior is very useful for writing prose
(not code) when you want text wrapped at a particular column with
a real newline, not just visually wrapped at the window edge. To
be usable it needs a command to toggle activation, and a setting
to decide whether it's on by default, this commit adds those.

The setting @int autojustify itself has been around for a while,
I'd forgotten about it, I've been wanting this feature for years,
made a failed attempt to add it once, but just (re)discovered the

<t tx="ekr.20170301013432.1">Test Driven Development (TDD) takes a bit of setup, but the initial investment repays itself many times over. To use TDD with Leo, start @test nodes with **preamble code**. As explained below, the preamble will do the following:

1. Optional: save the present outline if it has been changed.

2. Reload modules with imp.reload.

3. Create *new instances* of all objects under test.

Here is the actual preamble code used in Leo's import tests::

    if 0: # Preamble...
        # g.cls()
        if c.isChanged(): c.save()
        import leo.core.leoImport as leoImport
        import leo.plugins.importers.linescanner as linescanner
        import leo.plugins.importers.python
        import imp
        imp.reload(leo.plugins.importers.linescanner)
        imp.reload(leo.plugins.importers.python)
        imp.reload(leoImport)
        g.app.loadManager.createAllImporetersData()
        ic = leoImport.LeoImportCommands(c)
    else:
        ic = c.importCommands

    # run the test.
    ic.pythonUnitTest(p,s=s,showTree=True)
    
Let's look at this example in detail. These lines optionally clear the screen and save the outline::

    # g.cls()
    if c.isChanged(): c.save()

The next lines use imp.reload to re-import the affected modules::

    import leo.core.leoImport as leoImport
    import leo.plugins.importers.linescanner as linescanner
    import leo.plugins.importers.python
    import imp
    imp.reload(leo.plugins.importers.linescanner)
    imp.reload(leo.plugins.importers.python)
    imp.reload(leoImport)
    
Using imp.reload is usually not enough.  The preamble must *create new instances* of all objects under test. This can be a bit tricky. In the example above, the following lines create the new objects::

    g.app.loadManager.createAllImporetersData()
    ic = leoImport.LeoImportCommands(c)
    
The call to LM.createAllImporetersData() recomputes global tables describing importers. These tables must be updated to reflect possibly-changed importers. The call to leoImport.LeoImportCommands(c) creates a *new instance* of the c.importController. We want to use this new instance instead of the old instance, c.importController.

**Summary**
    
TDD makes a big difference when developing code. I can run tests repeatedly from the Leo outline that contains the code under test. TDD significantly improves my productivity.

Preamble code reload changed modules using imp.reload(). Preamble code must also create new instances of *all* objects that may have changed.

When creating several related unit tests, cutting and pasting the preamble from previous unit tests is usually good enough. @button scripts that create preamble code might be useful if you create lots of tests at once.

<t tx="ekr.20170309071256.1">Lately I've been thinking about programming in general. My thoughts have centered on the limits of the human brain to understand computer programs. This was triggered by watching `Inventing on Principle &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII&gt;`_. It's a daunting multifaceted concept which I'm sure people spend their entire lives pondering.

Most recently I've been focusing on one facet, abstraction and program "units". I define a "unit" as a part of the program that is considered a piece onto itself which can be labeled and referred to as a whole. Perhaps, as a daily Leo user, this is easy to think about because Leo does its best to coerce programmers and programs into looking at programming through this lens.

Most tools do not ignore this concept all together. Most programming environments have some sort of "outline" window which allows you to view the structure of a program at a higher level. As I have experienced it this "outline" view is always dictated by the features of a language (ex. outline divided up at module, class, function levels). In addition most tools incorporate "code folding" to help a programmer focus on language specific programming units (again, ex. folding at class and function definitions). 

Leo takes this concept to its limit. Leo offers language agnostic abstraction at arbitrary levels. It allows a programmer to structure their program outside of the confines of the programming paradigms of the language they're programming in. Of course it still helps to use the language specific "units" as a guide, in fact this is what Leo does upon import to create an initial outline structure from programs originating outside of Leo. 

I can't ignore the freedom of arbitrary abstraction, and I've come to rely upon it so much that I struggle to use non-Leo environments. It is well known that the human brain has a limited working memory. The act of programming stretches working memory to it's limit. Leo provides an environment in which a program can seamlessly be restructured to fit within the bounds of a programmers individual working memory. 

I realize this is a "why" and not a "how" and that this doesn't help anyone get better acquainted with Leo. But, as a programmer if you've ever felt frustrated with the organizational constructs of the language you're working in you might be surprised to realize that after using Leo it wasn't the language that was the problem, but a lack of tools to organize your programs in a way that makes sense to you.</t>

@chapter trees denote a **chapter**. You can **activate** a chapter from the icon area, or with chapter-select commands. Activating a chapter makes only those nodes in the chapter visible. The ``main`` chapter represents the entire outline. Activating the ``main`` chapter shows all outline nodes.

``chapter-select-main``
    Selects the main chapter.
    
``chapter-select-&lt;chapter-name&gt;``
    Selects a chapter by name.

<t tx="ekr.20170312085351.1">**Very Important**: Leo has hundreds of commands, but because of tab completion you do not have to remember, or even *know about* any of them.  Feel free to ignore commands that you don't use.

You could type the full command name in the minibuffer, followed by the ``&lt;Return&gt;`` key to invoke the command, but that would be *way* too much work. Instead, you can avoid most typing using **tab completion**. With tab completion, *there is no need to remember the exact names of Leo’s commands*.

For example, suppose you want to print out the list of Leo’s commands. You might remember only that there are several related commands and that they all start with "print". Just type ``&lt;Alt-X&gt;pri&lt;Tab&gt;``

You will see ``print-`` in the minibuffer. This is the longest common prefix of all the command names that start with ``pri``. The Completion tab in the log pane shows all the commands that start with ``print-``.

Now just type ``c&lt;Tab&gt;`` You will see the ``print-commands`` command in the minibuffer.

Finally, ``&lt;Return&gt;`` executes the ``print-commands`` command. The output of the print-commands command appears in the commands tab, and focus returns to the body pane.

<t tx="ekr.20170312085434.1">``file-open-by-name``
    Prompts for a filename. This command completes the name of files and directories as in command completion.  As a result, this command can be very fast.  You may want to bind this command to ``Ctrl-O`` instead of the default ``open-outline`` command.

This script creates an outline node as the last top-level node::

    p = c.lastTopLevel().insertAfter()
    p.h = 'my new node'
    c.redraw(p) # Selects the new node.
    
This script creates multiple nodes, with different headlines::

    parent = c.lastTopLevel().insertAfter()
    parent.h = 'New nodes'
    table = (
        ('First node', 'Body text for first node'),
        ('Node 2',     'Body text for node 2'),

        child = parent.insertAsLastChild()
        child.b = body.rstrip() + '\n' # Ensure exactly one trailing newline.
        child.h = headline
    c.selectPosition(parent) # Another way to select nodes.
    c.redraw()

This script creates a node containing today's date in the body text::

    import time
    p = c.lastTopLevel().insertAfter()
    p.h = "Today's date"
    p.b = time.strftime("%Y/%m/%d")

    pair: @file node; Tutorial

An **@file node** is a node whose headline starts with `@file` followed by a path to an external file::

    @file leoNodes.py
    @file ../../notes.txt

The @file node and its descendants represent an external file. Leo updates @file nodes when you change external files outside of Leo. When saving an outline, Leo writes all changed @file trees to their external files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170314060926.1">.. in tutorial-basics.html (External files)

.. index::
    pair: Markup; Tutorial

Leo's **markup** tells Leo how to create external files from @file trees. Markup may appear in any body text, and *must* appear in the body of the @file node itself.

There are two kinds of markup: **section references** (&lt;&lt; this is my section &gt;&gt;) and the **@others** directive. Section references refer to **named nodes**, nodes whose *headlines* look like a section reference. @others refers to all *other* (unnamed) nodes. Here is the body text of a typical @file node for a python file::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    '''whatever.py'''
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    @others
    # That's all, folks
    @language python
    @tabwidth
    
Child nodes must define the &lt;&lt; import &gt;&gt; node and the methods of the Controller class.

When writing this file, Leo writes the first two lines::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    '''whatever.py'''
    
followed by the *body text* of the &lt;&lt; imports&gt;&gt; node, followed by the body text of all *other* nodes, in outline order, followed by the comment # That's all, folks.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170314061000.1">.. index::
    pair: @clean; Tutorial

When writing **file trees**, Leo writes **sentinel comments** into external files. These comments represent outline structure. When writing an @file tree to a .leo file, Leo writes only the root @file node. To avoid sentinels, use **@clean** instead of @file::

    @clean leoNodes.py
    @clean ../../notes.txt
    
There is a small cost to @clean: Leo saves the entire @clean tree in the .leo file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170314061022.1">.. index::
    pair: @all; Tutorial
    pair: Outline Order; Tutorial

The **@all** directive tells Leo to write the nodes of an **@file tree** to the external file, *ignoring* all markup. As a result, Leo writes nodes to the file in **outline order**, the order in which they appear in the outline when all nodes are expanded.

<t tx="ekr.20170315072706.1">Leo and `Emacs org mode &lt;http://orgmode.org/&gt;`_ share similar goals. Org mode has many strengths related to non-programming tasks:

- Drawers: visible, pure text, easily extensible uA's.
- Agendas and tables.
- In-pane rendering of Latex and special symbols.
- Support for multiple source languages, including shell scripts, C, etc.
- Code blocks, with arguments.
- Result blocks.

But org mode is unsuitable for software development. Org mode's code block syntax::

    #+NAME: &lt;name&gt;
    #+BEGIN_SRC &lt;language&gt; &lt;switches&gt; &lt;header arguments&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
    #+END_SRC
    
would be unbearable in source files.

More generally, org mode lacks the following Leonine features:

- Automatic tangling when saving files.
- Automatic untangling when loading files.
- @others
- Importers for programming languages.
- Clones and especially Leo's clone-find commands. 
- A full Python API and DOM, including generators.
- @command, @button, @test.

.. _`algorithm`: appendices.html#the-mulder-ream-update-algorithm
.. _`Directed Acyclic Graphs`:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph

Leo's is based on technologies missing from org mode:

- Clones require that outlines be `Directed Acyclic Graphs`_.
- Leo updates @clean trees using an `algorithm`_ that could not be duplicated in org mode.
- Leo's outlines are true Python objects, with unique, persistent identities.

In contrast, org mode is completely text oriented:

- Org mode's API is limited to parsing body text.
- Org mode simulates a DOM with text filters.

<t tx="ekr.20170403185500.1">**Warning**: The p.b and p.h setters and p.setDirty() are *very* expensive:

- p.b = s calls c.setBodyString(p, s) which will recolor body text and update the node's icon.
- p.h = s calls c.setHeadString(p, s) which calls p.setDirty().
- p.setDirty() changes the icons of all ancestor @file nodes.

In contrast, the corresponding p.v.b and p.v.b setters and p.v.setDirty() are extremely fast.

Usually, code *should* use the p.b and p.h setters and p.setDirty(), despite their cost, because they update Leo's outline pane properly. Calling c.redraw() is *not* enough.

These performance gotchas become important for repetitive commands, like cff, replace-all and recursive import. In such situations, code should use p.v.b and p.v.h setters instead of p.b and p.h setters.

[Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) 5.6 is now available on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor).

Leo is an IDE, outliner and PIM, as described [here](http://leoeditor.com/preface.html).

Simulating Leo's features in Vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible, just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...

**The highlights of Leo 5.6**

- The cursesGui2.py plugin creates a console gui for Leo.
- Added "Yes to All" and "No to All" buttons to file-changed dialog.
- Improved how Leo switches between git branches.
- Created outline-oriented git-diff command.

<t tx="ekr.20170612093902.1">Use @others unless the contents of a node must appear in a certain spot, or in a certain order. For examples, most of Leo's source files start like this::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    @others

The &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; section reference ensures that imports appear first. Another example::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; base classes &gt;&gt;
    @others
    
This ensures that base classes are defined before their subclasses.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170612101117.1">Leo recognizes section references *everywhere*, even inside strings or comments. If a source code line contains &lt;&lt; followed by &gt;&gt; on the same line, you must rewrite the line.  For example, suppose your C code contains::

    a = 1 &lt;&lt; 5 + 2 &gt;&gt; 3;
    
You could rewrite this as::

    a = 1 &lt;&lt; 5 + \
        2 &gt;&gt; 3;

.. Smart quotes are probably causing problems here:

g.angleBrackets(s) returns string s enclosed in angle brackets.

For example, h = g.anglebrackets(\"abc\") sets h to &lt;&lt;abc&gt;&gt;.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170618015524.1">I thought I would write my own testimonial. I don't ever do this, as I often roll my eyes at testimonials, but my enthusiasm is at such a degree about Leo, that I must give "props" where props are due.

**BACKGROUND**

**The Beginning**: Coming from being a Java professional in the early aughts, I was used to Netbeans. It was fine I guess. A few years later I decided I wanted to be a web developer.

**Why I sought out a new editor**: I wanted something extensible in FULL. I wanted to make it my own. It is like your home. You move in, it is up to you to make it your "HOME". So is an editor. You spend all of your time with it. It must be YOURS I figure. Comfy like a pair of old shoes.

**HISTORY**

**Ultra-Edit**: This was my first non-ide, IDE. No disrespect to UltraEdit, I am sure it has many awesome features I never used.  I never really got the chance.  I wanted something lightweight and soon found Scite around 2006.

**Notepad++**: Eventually  I found Notepad++ (which I still think is awesome, and would recommend to anyone).  I have been using it for 8 years, and I still do use it occasionally.  Mostly  because  I am still getting used to Leo.

**NOW**

I am at an age now, and a point in my career where I want to make my life (and job) as simple as possible. Leo helps me do that.  It is hard to explain--the outlining gives the ability to mix thoughts with code--even life with code, in a very intuitive fashion. Perhaps this is "literate programming".  I don't know.  They never mentioned that term in my CS classes.  Whatever it is, I like it.

Side benefit--my code has never been so well formatted and documented!

**The thing I personally love most**

As I alluded to, so much ability to extend.  At work, I work on what my boss wants, but at home, I spend most of my time extending Leo.  I have never seen an editor so easy to extend, and believe me, I have evaluated at least 20 editors in the past 5 months. 

That's the thing--anything I want to work a different way, or anything I want to be better, I can do it on my own. I don't have to submit a request. If I at least have enough curiosity to google or ask for a bit of help, I can make it what I want.

You name it.  

- If I would like the log to work differently, or create my own output pane: no problem.
- If I want to add PHP Unit tests to the menu, no problem.
- If I want to make a personal organizer, mixed in with my work flow, no problem.
- If I want to have my python, PHP code, journal, all integrated together so that everything makes sense from 20,000 feet, no problem.
- If I want to change the entire look and feel...and I mean EVERYTHING...not just some things, no problem.
- If I want to be able to easily explain the code to a non-technical colleague, no problem.  The outline can be followed by anyone with some degree of intelligence.

You get the idea...

And for me, that means everything.</t>

The area between colons in the Tree pane corresponds to Leo's icon box::

    +:    : node has unexpanded children.
    -:    : node is expanded.
     :    : node has no children.
     '*   : node is the selected node.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20170618115228.1">The console gui sends the output of g.pr and g.trace to another console. To do this, you must start a socket listener in the *other* console, listening to the broadcaster on localhost::

    Leo Qt (listener) &lt;-- Leo console, (broadcaster)
    
To set this up:

1. In the **listener console**, start a regular Leo Qt session with the ``--listen-to-log`` command-line option. You can start a listener at any time with Leo's ``listen-to-log`` command. The ``kill-log-listener`` command kills the listener, if it exists.
  
2. In the **broadcast console**, start Leo with the console gui using the ``--gui=console`` command-line option. This automatically starts the broadcaster.

If the listener is active, the log output from the curses gui console will be displayed in the listener's console.

<t tx="ekr.20170707034853.24">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/510

No real changes were made. Plugins should not create bindings by calling k.registerCommand.  Such bindings happen "too late" in the startup process to be over-ridden in settings files.  Instead, plugins can define suggested bindings in leoSettings.leo.

Note: The mod_scripting plugins creates bindings from @button and @command nodes. Again, these are "late" bindings that can not be over-ridden in settings files. I don't believe this is a big problem. The problem arises because Leo loads plugins after loading all outlines. It's not a direct consequence of using settings files.

Leo now has two new command-line options. These provide more detail than the print-binding or print-settings commands, but only for a single setting or binding. Examples:

    --trace-setting=http-port
        # setting name
    --trace-setting=cff
        # command name
    --trace-binding=shift-ctrl-f

**Warning**: The p.b and p.h setters and p.setDirty() are *very* expensive:

- p.b = s calls c.setBodyString(p, s) which will recolor body text and update the node's icon.
- p.h = s calls c.setHeadString(p, s) which calls p.setDirty().
- p.setDirty() changes the icons of all ancestor @file nodes.

In contrast, the corresponding p.v.b and p.v.b setters and p.v.setDirty() are extremely fast.

Usually, code *should* use the p.b and p.h setters and p.setDirty(), despite their cost, because they update Leo's outline pane properly. Calling c.redraw() is *not* enough.

These performance gotchas become important for repetitive commands, like cff, replace-all and recursive import. In such situations, code should use p.v.b and p.v.h setters instead of p.b and p.h setters.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/npyscreen/nk2pjj71bok

The log-listen (aka listen-to-log) and kill-log-listen (aka, listen-log-kill) commands implement this logging cookbook recipe:
https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging-cookbook.html#sending-and-receiving-logging-events-across-a-network

The log-listen command creates a logging listener whose output goes to Leo's console. The listener runs in a separate process so that Leo doesn't hang.

Start the listener first, then start another process in another console. All logging output from the second process will be captured and displayed by the listener, provided that the second process includes a call to `rootLogger.addHandler(socketHandler)`.

leo/external/log_broadcast.py contains example code. leo/plugins/cursesGui2.py uses this pattern to broadcast g.trace.

navigating to these points is useful when using speech recognition and is frequently useful when creating macros to operate on text. Jump means you go to the location without remembering where you were. Push means remembering, in a stack, where you were and being able to return to that location with a pop command.

The push/pop model works well with speech recognition because you don't have to give explicit navigation commands. You just go back to where you were.

<t tx="ekr.20170804153108.2">Here are step-by-step instructions for developing code in Leo without having to reload Leo.

1. Create a **dev node** as a test harness.

This node (in the Leo outline) defines your development environment. You can use an @test node, an @button node, or an @command node. Using a plain outline node would be less convenient because you won't be able to execute it so easily.

The **dev script** is the script in the dev node itself.  The **code under development** is the code exercised by the dev script.

This is the most important step! Once you say to yourself, "Ok, I'm going to be clever and develop my code using a dev script, everything else will happen naturally. That is, the programming process itself will lead you to the next action. If you don't create a custom dev environment you will have to reload Leo to test your new code. That will be much slower.

2. Set up your dev node so you can execute it with a single keystroke.

You can do any of the following:

- Use a marked @test node and use run-marked-unit-tests-locally.
- Disable or ignore all other @test nodes and then use run-all-unit-tests-locally.
- Bind a keystroke to an @button or @command node.
- Run an @button or @command node the first time from the minibuffer, and then re-execute it with Ctrl-P (repeat-complex-command.

3. Define or access the code under development.

There are two main ways to do this:

A. Clone the code under test and move the clones so they are children of the dev node. Access the code under test using @others in the top-level node.

B. Import one or more modules containing the code under test. Access the code using imp.reload to ensure that all imported modules are up-to-date.

4. Create new instances of objects

**You must not use existing Leo objects when testing Leo code.**  This includes all objects accessible via c, g and p, either directly or indirectly.  For example, you must not use c, c.frame, c.frame.body, etc., etc., even if you have reloaded all of Leo's modules!

You will seldom need to worry about reloading code if you use @others to define the code under test.

5. Run the test, edit, repeat

After creating the dev node you simply run the dev script until everything works :-)  The details depend on the code being developed.  Otoh, we can safely assume that devs can handle problems as they arise.

Summary

@test, @command or @button can be thought of as defining an (almost) pristine dev environment. This is another way of describing the Stupendous Aha. The initial cost of creating dev nodes pays off immediately.

Dev scripts should create a new, pristine environment every time it they are executed, using imp.reload as needed. Dev scripts should always create new objects for testing.  Dev scripts may use Leo's core objects provided they have not been modified.

Dev scripts have many advantages.  They can:

- access code using clones.
- use outlines to organize the code under development.
- form a permanent record of completed work.
- can morph into unit tests.

Redrawing the screen happens *only* as the result of an explicit call to c.redraw. In particular, neither c.selectPosition nor its helpers redraw the screen.

c.redraw_later() sets a flag requesting that c.outerUpdate call c.redraw if necessary. Any call to c.redraw resets this flag. cc.selectChapterForPosition calls c.redraw_later.

c.disable_redraw() sets a flag disabling all outline redraws. c.enable_redraw() re-enables redrawing. This is similar to the old begin_update/end_update scheme, but simpler and more explicit. Use this as follows:

try:
    c.disable_redraw()
    # Code that might otherwise redraw the tree.
finally:
    c.enable_redraw()

c.outerUpdate has been drastically simplified. It no longer handles requests for redraws, recoloring, bring-to-front or de-iconification. It now handles requests for delayed focus changes and delayed redraws. It also handles "childrenModified" and "contentModified" hooks.

The new git-diff command shows the diffs between any uncommitted work and git's HEAD in an outline. This is, by far, the best outline-oriented diff in Leo's history. The command works for all kinds of external files.

**Outline organization**

This command creates a single tree as the last top-level node of the outline::

  - git diff  # The single organizer node for the command
    - file A  # The organizer node for file A.
              # Body contains the text diff of the entire file.
      - Added # An organizer node for all added nodes, created only if necessary.
        - node 1 # A copy of the first added node.
        - node 2 # A copy of the second added node.
            ...
      - Deleted  # An organizer node for all deleted nodes, created only if necessary.
        - node 1 # A copy of the first deleted node.
            ...
      - Changed  # An organizer node for all changed nodes, created only if necessary.
        - node 1 # An organizer node for the changed node.
                 #  Body contains the text diff of that node.
          - old: node1 # A copy of the old node.
          - new: node1 # A copy of the new node.

This command does not use git diff in any way. For example, moving a node affects only the overall diff in the organizer node for the file. Moved nodes do not otherwise appear in the diff.

The post: `Debugging npyscreen apps using two consoles &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/npyscreen/nk2pjj71bok&gt;`_ discusses the strategy used to bootstrap this plugin. It's easier to develop now that so much is working, but developing this code will always be difficult.

The console gui code stands "between" the npyscreen code and Leo's core code. With only very minor exceptions, **Leo's core and the npyscreen code must remain completely unchanged**.  Thus, the console gui wraps just about everything. This makes the plugin's code inherently complex, but this complexity can not be helped.

**Important**: It would pointless to describe the code in detail. Devs must come up to speed on their own by studying traces. Don't even *think* of trying to remember details. Instead, use cff to study the code.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20171201034131.1">You *can not* use g.pdb to debug cursesGui2.py, for two reasons:

- g.pdb's output would overwrite the screen.
  Writing to the second console would not help because...

- There would be no way to get input to pdb.

As a result, **devs must uses traces** to figure out what is happening. The
`Broadcasting and listing &lt;console-gui.html#broadcasting-and-listening&gt;`_
section tells how to send traces to a *second* console. Use only g.pr and g.trace to create traces. **Do not use print statements in cursesGui2.py**.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20171201034133.1">The following methods contain crucial traces:

- **IH.handle_input** (external/npyscreen/wgwidget.py) shows the raw input to npyscreen.
- **k.masterKeyHandler** (leoKeys.py) shows the keys passed to Leo's core.
- **k.masterCommand** (leoKeys.py) shows the Leo command (if any) bound to the raw key.

Other noteworthy methods and functions, all in cursesGui2.py:

- **CGui.createCursesTop** creates the main window by calling a helper for each part of the main window. The helpers handle the *extremely complex* details of setting and/or injecting ivars into various classes. Getting these ivars right is the heart of the plugin.

- **LeoMiniBuffer.h_return** contains a crucial hack that allows the minibuffer to be used both to enter commands and to enter find strings.

- The top-level **es, pr and trace functions** replace g.es, g.pr and g.trace functions so that they send their results to the second console.

- **CGui.monkeyPatch** contains some hacks needed to make the 'start-find' command work.

To enable tracing for these methods, and many others, set the trace variable at the start of the method.  Feel free to add your own traces in consoleGui2.py.

<t tx="ekr.20171201041304.1">The npyscreen package defines widgets with limited capabilities:

- **npyscreen does not support selection ranges in text**! 

- Shift arrows are not supported, because there are no selection ranges.
  
- Cut/paste is theoretically supported, but in the absence of selections
  only paste might work. And paste may work only in limited contexts...

- Editing the log or body pane is a bit strange. You switch between tabs
  with tab or shift-tab. Type 'e' to edit edit mode, as shown on the
  on-screen prompts.

  Edit mode defines a *range* of lines that are being edited. Hitting
  return extends the range. Initially, the range consists of a single line,
  with the cursor at the end of the line. Moving outside the range with
  up/down arrow keys ends editing. Doing a more Leonine job would require a
  complete rewrite of the base classes.

- Deleting a line is not possible in edit mode. Use 'd' outside of edit
  mode to delete a line in the log or body panes.

- The body text is not syntax colored.

<t tx="ekr.20171204104344.1">The following bugs have resisted serious efforts to fix them. I will work on them further only if they cause *serious* difficulties to those who use the console gui.

- Shifting focus to the minibuffer after Ctrl-F works initially, but thereafter Tab and Shift-Tab don't work as expected until all widgets have been visited.  A workaround is to navigate to the minibuffer *before* using Ctrl-F, but this is not a perfect fix either.

- After startup, the output from g.es correctly goes to the log widget, but it is scrolled out of view!</t>

From this `long discussion`_ on leo-editor:

From Rob Keeney:

**Typical Use case**

I teach a variety of classes in a business environment and need handouts,
teaching aids, worksheets and training manuals that are specifically
customized for each client. These documents are easier to manage, print and
protect using standard PDFs.

**Workflow Overview**

- Document content comes from a primary resource directory arranged by
  topic (not client specific).
- I have a Resources.leo file that helps me keep that directory organized.
- All of the content files are written in LaTex (I use a .txi file
  extension of my own invention to indicate the file is an 'input' file
  only, not the main output file which uses .tex).
- I have a Client.leo file for each client in their own directory to
  organize work specific to each client.
- For each document needed for a client project, I create a Document.tex
  file from a standard template and change the document properties as
  needed for the specific client, project and document.
- The Document.tex file acts as the presentation 'shell' for the document
  and I simply add \input{"\ResourcePath Content.txi"} after the
  \begin{document} statement (\ResourcePath is a shortcut command to the
  location of the content resource). This shell determines such things as
  the document title, document type, client name, header/footer information
  and revision date.
- Since I work primarily in Windows, I use TeXNicCenter to process (typeset) the Document.tex file to create PDF output. (I do not use TeXNicCenter for editing, only file processing).

**Workflow Notes and Shortcuts**

- Years ago, I discovered the incredible exam class for LaTex and now
  use it almost exclusively. It makes it much easier to create student
  and teacher versions of the same content (for example, handouts for
  students and training manual with speaking notes for the teacher).
- I use \@outline-data tree-abbreviations in Leo to create each new
  Document.tex file from a template with variables (very cool!)
- I created many @data abbreviations in Leo to speed up typing of standard
  LaTex structures (would be happy to share them if anyone is interested).
- All document content stays in the Resources directory and only 'shell'
  documents are in the client directories.
- These shell documents allow for client-specific information to be added
  to the headers, footers and in some cases as variables inside the content
  area itself (using \theClient variable that I define).

**Software Needed**

- Leo, and its dependencies.
- MiKTex for the LaTex distribution and package management (I have it set
  to auto-update as needed).
- TeXNicCenter for processing (typesetting) to PDF output.

**Example Leo file**

.. _`example Leo file`: https://github.com/leo-editor/snippets/tree/master/examples/workflow/latex-pdf

See this `example Leo file`_.

**Questions**

Q: Can you control TexNicCenter from Leo - or do you process the file and preview process manually?

A: No, I run processing (typesetting) in TeXNicCenter manually. Typically,
I create a blank project file and open however many files required for that
project. That way it's easier to clean up the extra files created during
the process steps. HTH. There might be a way to invoke the LaTex commands
through Leo, but that's way above my pay grade.

From Arjan Mossel:

I'm using Leo to organize sections like \chapter, \section and \subsection.
Since I'm just writing latex in Leo, I need to keep track of the right
hierarchies, so I can't freely move nodes around in the hierarchy or I end
up with \subsection at the same level as \section, etc. It would be great
to be able to let Leo handle this.

MyProject

    os.chdir(working_dir)
    
    # The commands to run.
    run_xelatex = 'xelatex ' + working_dir + os.sep + 'myproject.tex'
    run_bibtex =  'bibtex ' + working_dir + os.sep + 'myproject'
    
    g.es('Running XeLaTeX and BibTeX')
    # os.system starts a new subshell

<t tx="ekr.20180124100440.3">This project makes major improvements to Leo's redraw logic with virtually
no effect on existing code. The highlights of the changes are as follows:

1. Redrawing the screen happens only as the result of an explicit call to
   c.redraw. In particular, neither c.selectPosition nor its helpers redraw
   the screen immediately. However, cc.selectChapterForPosition ensures
   that a redraw happens eventually using...

2. c.redraw_later() sets a flag requesting that c.outerUpdate call c.redraw
   if necessary. Any call to c.redraw resets this flag.

3. c.disable_redraw() sets a flag disabling all outline redraws.
   c.enable_redraw() re-enables redrawing. Use these methods as follows::

    try:
        c.disable_redraw()
        # Code that might otherwise redraw the tree.
    finally:
        c.enable_redraw()

This pattern is essential in the new git-diff code. Lots of redraw code
changed, but in similar and straightforward ways. In effect, the new code
is exactly the same as the old unless c.disable_redraw() has been called, I
do not expect problems here.

4. c.outerUpdate has been drastically simplified. It now only handles
   requests for delayed focus changes (as before) and the new delayed
   redraws.


Note: cc.selectChapterForPosition calls c.redraw *only* if the chapter
changes.

- Added support for c.redraw_later, called from cc.selectChapterForPosition.
- c.bringToFront now works without using c.outerUpdate.
- c.widgetWantsFocusNow now just calls c.set_focus &amp; clears
  c.requestedFocusWidget.
- c.outerUpdate no longer handles recoloring or redrawing.
- Replaced all calls to c.recolor_now by c.recolor.
- Replaced all calls to redraw_now by redraw.
- Removed all calls to body.forceFullRecolor.
- Removed forceFullRecolorFlag.
- Removed c.incrementalRecolorFlag.
- c.selectPosition never calls c.redraw.
- Removed c.requestRedrawFlag and c.outerUpdate never calls c.redraw.

<t tx="ekr.20180124100440.5">g.callers(verbose=True) returns the callers on separate lines, displaying file name, line number **and class name**. This is especially useful for gui programming, where there may be many 'display, 'edit', 'redraw' and 'update' methods.  It's also useful where you just don't have any idea where a function or method resides.

For example, these traces, in BoxTitle.edit::

    g.trace('===== (BoxTitle:%s) entry_widget: %s' % (
        self.__class__.__name__,
        self.entry_widget.__class__.__name__))
    g.trace('CALLERS', g.callers(verbose=True))

Produce::

    trace: edit ===== (BoxTitle:BoxTitleLog) entry_widget: LeoLog
    trace: edit CALLERS
      line   32 apNPSApplication.py            LeoApp.__remove_argument_call_main

      line   66 fm_form_edit_loop.py           LeoForm.edit

Each line shows the line number and file containing the function or method.  All the above lines show methods.

<t tx="ekr.20180124100440.6">The new leo_cloud plugin allows subtrees within a .leo file to be stored in the cloud. It should be possible to support various cloud platforms, currently git is supported (i.e. you can use GitLab or GitHub or your own remote git server).

A leo_cloud subtree has a top node with a headline that starts with '@leo_cloud'. The rest of the headline is ignored. The body of this top node is used to describe the cloud service. For example::

    type: Git
    remote: git@gitlab.com:tnbrown/leo_cloud_storage.git
    local: ~/.leo/leo_cloud/gitlab_leo_cloud_storage
    ID: shortcuts
    read_on_load: ask
    write_on_save: ask
    
The first three lines can be repeated with different IDs to store different subtrees at the same remote cloud location.

read_on_load: / write_on_save: can be yes, no, or ask. If it's not one of those three, there's a warning dialog.

There's also a file system backend, which would look like this::

    type: FileSystem
    root: ~/DropBox/leo_cloud
    ID: my_notes
    read_on_load: ask
    write_on_save: ask

The FileSystem backend was meant to be for development, but of course if you map it into a folder that is sync'ed externally, as shown above, it can serve as a cloud adapter too.

The highlights of recent work:

1. The label above the minibuffer now contains the present state. For
   example, after Ctrl-F the label is::

    Mini-buffer: Search:

indicating that a search string is expected.

2. When selected, the tree pane highlights the '*' line containing c.p.

3. The status pane shows Find options after Ctrl-F and various toggle-find-* and set-find-* commands.

So it is now clear what is going on at all times.  This clarity is more important than features!

4. The minibuffer works with tab completion. Examples:

    run-a&lt;tab&gt;l&lt;tab&gt;&lt;return&gt; executes run-all-unit-tests-locally.
    toggle-find-r&lt;tab&gt;&lt;return&gt; executes toggle-find-regex-option. # Shows results in status area.

This is a huge step forward in power.

5. Aha: the reason that all (enabled) unit tests work with the console gui is that the string representations of the body, tree and log (including headlines) are completely functional.  True, the npyscreen views of same are weak and/or buggy, but that is a secondary matter.

For example, the Find commands probably work completely, even though the found text is not selected.  Furthermore, there are workarounds.  It is possible to select all lines containing the text selection, even though npyscreen does not support character selections.

Summary

The curses gui plugin is more functional and less confusing than before.

- leo-c starts the test.
- listen-to-log command to get message in THIS console.
- Tab and Shift Tab switch panes.
- F4 runs all unit tests.

<t tx="ekr.20180124100450.3">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/327

This enhancement allows you to override bindings made in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo by setting:

    command-name = None

in the local .leo file, that is, outside of leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo. Important: binding:

    do-nothing = &lt;key&gt;

does not work.  That would eat &lt;key&gt; entirely.  Instead, the new code calls k.handleUnboundKeys when it sees any key previously bound to command-name.

What I did:
- k.masterKeyHandler handles k.killedBindings.
- --trace-binding=BINDING works for bindings or command names.
- Removed k.killBinding: it has no chance of working.
- Added k.killedBindings, a list of command names for which bindings have been killed in local files.
- ParserBaseClass.doShortcuts appends command names k.killedBindings.
- Added c.config.isLocalSettingFile

<t tx="ekr.20180124100450.839">**Status**

1. This project does real checking, something that none of my type-related
   projects has ever done before. The cc.resolve* methods are simple and
   straightforward by the standards of tools like pylint and rope. Recent
   revs have cleaned up these methods a bit.

   From the start, the code has been able to detect violations of naming
   conventions that neither pylint nor pyflakes are ever going to find.
   Speed has always been good enough. On my machine the checker checks the
   77 of Leo's sources in about 5.5 seconds. Greater speed would be
   possible using a one-pass algorithm, but that is not necessary now.

2. The "before and after" design/coding pattern is a spectacular success.
   It completely decouples the cc and cct classes. Neither is aware of each
   other in any way. In effect, before and after methods add to ast node
   visitors without changing those visitors in any way and without any
   knowledge of the node visitors.

3. The present code is sound. It parses the code correctly, and visits
   nodes in the proper order.

   The initial prototype used regex patterns to do a quick, inaccurate,
   parse of the file. This strategy allowed me to focus on the cc.resolve*
   methods first, not later. Imo this was the only way I could have made
   the progress I did make.

   Recent revs have removed all regex patterns from the code. This could
   only be done once the cc.resolve methods were in place. Removing regex
   patterns makes parsing sound, which simplifies code downstream.

4. The new cc.get_chain helper preprocesses chains like a.b.c or a.b().c or
   a.b[].c. This method is crucial, for several reasons:

- It clarifies and simplifies various parts of the code.
- It reveals the complexity of ast.Attribute trees.
- It shows just where type inference or convention checking is likely to fail.

None of the benefits of cc.get_chain was obvious to me before creating it.

**Summary**

The cc command must be extended using @data settings and global patterns.
It should also check keyword args.

The check-conventions command is a successful proof of concept:

- It finds real problems quickly.
- The code is sound. It parses code properly, and in the proper order.
- Before and after methods collapse code complexity.
- It will be easy for me to resume work on this project in future

As a result, this project is at a reasonable stopping point.

**To do**

1. [Most important] At present, the check-conventions (cc) command only
   knows about Leo conventions. Instead, the command should used @data
   nodes to define conventions.

2. [Important] The cc command should be able to check global naming
   conventions. For Leo, this would include the convention that self.c is a
   Commands object and that g is the leoGlobals module, etc.

3. [Important] At present the cc command does not check keyword arguments
   to function calls.

4 [Maybe]
    - improve get_chain?
        - What percentage of chains can be resolved?
        - Use resolve_stack to bound recursion?
    
    - Add support for global patterns.
    - Support @data nodes.
    - check w, w.wrapper, w.widget?

"A research project typically relies upon components such as:

    The data being studied;
    Details of calculations and code used in data analysis;
    Methodological conventions and assumptions;
    Decisions among alternate analytic paths.

However, the documents produced by a research project typically stand apart from the things they describe and rely upon, which makes it difficult for other researchers to reproduce the results and to understand fully the conclusions of the research project. This situation is problematic because reproducibility of results and accurate communication are both central to notions of good science.

A software solution to this problem was proposed by \citet{compendium}, who “introduce the concept of a compendium as both a container for the different elements that make up the document and its computations (i.e., text, code, data, …), and as a means for distributing, managing and updating the collection.”"
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180124100723.4">They summarize the uses and implications of a compendium as follows:

    It encapsulates the actual work of the author, not just an abridged version suitable for publication;
    It can display different levels of detail in derived documents;
    The computations included in it can be re-run by an interested reader, potentially with different inputs;
    It contains explicit computational details that make it easier for an interested reader to adapt and extend the methods;
    It enables programmatic construction of plots and tables;
    Its components can be treated as data or inputs to software and manipulated programmatically in ways perhaps not envisioned by the author.

Reproducible research thus approaches mixed natural and computational language documents from a different direction than literate programming. Rather than adding prose to computational projects, reproducible research seeks to augment publications of scientific research with the computer code used to carry out the research. Whereas literate programming extracts embedded code into an external file used as input to a compiler or an interpreter, code embedded in a reproducible research document is intended to be executed as part of the document generation process. In this way the data, analysis, and figures supporting a publication can be generated from the publication itself.

<t tx="ekr.20180124100723.7">Leo easily supports `Literate programming`_ (LP) and  `Reproducible Research`_ (RR) with unique, powerful underlying technology, not a mishmash of features.

**LP**: Leo redefines LP, showing that many kinds of comments are unnecessary in an outline environment. In LP terms, Leo supports *automatic* `tangling`_ and `weaving`_, but those terms are not used in Leo because they happen automatically.  More importantly, Leo supports `untangling`_, something entirely missing in org mode. Leo can update outlines corresponding to external files when those files change outside of Leo, preserving and updating outline structure as it does so. Untangling requires the `Mulder-Ream update algorithm`_, something entirely missing in org mode.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180124100723.8">@language rest
@wrap

Leo is fundamentally more powerful than org mode scripting:

1. Unlike org mode, Leo's outline nodes are true Python objects, *easily* accessible via Leo's Python `API`_. Furthermore, Leo scripting is based on Python and Python's standard library, not elisp and Emacs-specific code. Leo scripts can be run outside of Leo.

2. Leo can `compose`_ both external files and scripts using the same `markup`_. Unlike org mode, Leo's markup applies *everywhere* and is fully integrated with Leo's outline structure. As a result, it is complete natural to compose external files or scripts (experiments) from a suboutline. For example: this defines an external file::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    '''whatever.py'''
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    @others
    # That's all, folks
    @language python
    @tabwidth
    
And this this defines the top-level part of a script::

@language python

    @langauge python
    '''My script'''
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    class Controller:
        # Child nodes define the methods of this class.
        @others
    Controller(c).run # Yes, c *is* defined.

@language rest
    
There is no need to put this inside wonky org-mode markup. The @language python directive tells Leo how to execute the script. More importantly, the `@others`_ directive includes *properly indented* code from descendant nodes. At the moment, I can't tell from the org mode docs whether anything like Leo's ``@others`` directive exists.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180124100723.9">Leo's underlying database is a `directed acyclic graph`_, (DAG) not a `tree`_ or, as in org-mode plain text with a collection of hacks that make that text look like a tree. The technology behind Leo's `clones`_ is based on the underlying DAG. It has been optimized over several decades. Org mode will likely never have clones.

Leo has a full-featured `Document Object Model`_ (DOM) consisting, among other things, of a collection of Python generators that traverse trees, subtrees or ancestor, visiting clones multiple times. Leo distinguishes between `positions`_ in a traversal and `vnodes`_, containing the actual data in each node.

Leo 5.7 final, http://leoeditor.com, is now available on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor).

Leo is an IDE, outliner and PIM, as described [here](http://leoeditor.com/preface.html).

Simulating Leo's features in Vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible, just as it is possible to simulate Python in C or assembly language...

**The highlights of Leo 5.7**

- pip install leo.
- A debian package for Leo.
- A web-based Leo Viewer, written by Joe Orr.
- Added diff-leo-files and diff-and-open-leo-files commands.
  These create outline-oriented diffs for .leo files.
- New reload-settings command.
- Leo optionally shows user tips on startup.
- Added a new Tips page to Leo's documentation.
- A visual widget for editing cvs tables.
- Spell checking works without pyenchant
- Improved the console_gui plugin.
- Added live links from urls in the log pane.
- Unit tests use a string gui, making them faster and more robust.
- The line_numbering plugin shows line numbers in external files.
- Improved the javascript importer.
- Added a TreePad importer.
- Added 6 new commands.
- Dozens of bug fixes.

As a happy side effect, right clicking now always shows this popup. That's
because "New Outline" is always valid regardless of how many tabs there are
and regardless of whether tabs have been detached.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.10">.. _`abbreviations tutorial`: tutorial-pim.html#using-abbreviations-and-templates

Leo's abbreviations can correct spelling mistakes, expand to multiple lines
or even trees of nodes. Abbreviations can execute scripts and can prompt
for values to be substituted within the abbreviation.
See the `abbreviations tutorial`_ for more details.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.11">.. _`@test nodes`: tutorial-basics.html#test-nodes

`@test nodes`_ create unit tests. They automatically convert the body to a
subclass of unittest.TestCase. Leo's run-* commands execute unit tests.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.12">.. _`@button nodes`: tutorial-basics.html#button-and-command-nodes

`@button nodes`_ create commands. For example, `@button my-command` creates
the `my-command` button and the `my-command` command. Within `@button`
scripts, c.p is the presently selected outline node.
**@button nodes bring scripts to data**.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.13">Become familiar with Leo's most important plugins:
    
- bookmarks.py manages bookmarks.
- contextmenu.py shows a menu when when right-clicking.
- mod_scripting.py supports @button and @command nodes.
- quicksearch.py adds a Nav tab for searching.
- todo.py handles to-do lists and is a project manager.
- valuespace.py creates an outline-oriented spreadsheet.
- viewrendered.py renders content in the rendering pane.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.14">.. _`personal settings`: customizing.html#specifying-settings

Put your `personal settings`_ in myLeoSettings.leo, not leoSettings.leo.

- The leo-settings-leo command opens leoSettings.leo.
- The my-leo-settings-leo command opens myLeoSettings.leo.
- Copy the desired settings nodes from leoSettings.leo to myLeoSettings.leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.15">.. _`clones tutorial`: tutorial-pim.html#clones

Clones are "live" copies of the node itself and all its descendants.
See the `clones tutorial`_ for more details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.16">.. _`commands tutorial`: tutorial-basics.html#commands

To execute a command, type `Alt-X` followed by the first few characters of command name, followed by `Tab`. The list of commands matching what you have typed appears.
For more details, see the `commands tutorial`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.17">The cff command (aka clone-find-flattened) prompts for a search pattern,
then clones all matching nodes so they are the children of a new last
top-level node. This is a great way to study code.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.18">The cff command (aka clone-find-flattened-marked) clones all marked nodes
as a children of a new node, created as the last top-level node. Use this
to gather nodes throughout an outline.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.19">g.callers() returns the last n callers (default 4) callers of a function or
method. The verbose option shows each caller on a separate line. For
example::
    
    g.trace(g.callers())

You must `launch Leo from a console window`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.2">You can have a personal shortcut to run script while developing it. For
example: put `@key=Alt-4` in headline. If your script grows to several
subnodes, you won't have to select top node every time you wish to run
script. It would be enough to just press your universal shortcut.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.20">The g.trace function prints all its arguments to the console. It's great
for seeing patterns in running code.
You must `launch Leo from a console window`_ to see the output of g.trace.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.21">.. _`Python's pdb debugger`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html

g.pdb launches `Python's pdb debugger`_, adapted for Leo.
You must `launch Leo from a console window`_ to use the pdb debugger.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.22">The find-quick-selected (Ctrl-Shift-F) command finds all nodes containing the selected text.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.23">The parse-body command parses p.b (the body text of the selected node) into separate nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.24">The sort-siblings (Alt-A) command sorts all the child nodes of their parent, or all top-level nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.25">leoSettings.leo contains the defaults for all of Leo's
settings, with documentation for each. Searching
leoSettings.leo is thus a good way to find settings.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.26">Use Alt-N to cycle through the clones of the present cloned node.
This is a fast way of finding the clone whose ancestor is an @&lt;file&gt; node.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.27">.. _`cloning nodes`: tutorial-pim.html#clones

Focus your attention of the task at hand by `cloning nodes`, including
\@file nodes, then moving those clones so they are the last top-level nodes
in the outline. This allows you to work on nodes scattered throughout an
outline without altering the structure of @file nodes.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.3">When developing scripts that use Log window to display results, it is
sometimes useful to clear Log window by inserting the following two lines
at the beginning of your script::

    c.frame.log.selectTab('Log')
    c.frame.log.clearLog()</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.4">Within scripts, use section references only when code must be placed
exactly. Here is a common pattern for @file nodes for python files::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    &lt;&lt;imports&gt;&gt;
    @others</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.5">The @button make-md-toc script in LeoDocs.leo writes a markdown table of
contents to the console. You can then copy the text from the console to
your document. The selected outline node should be an `@auto-md` node.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.6">.. _`pyflakes`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes

`pyflakes`_ is a superb programming tool. It checks python files almost instantly.

These settings cause Leo to run pyflakes whenever saving a .py file and to raise a dialog if any errors are found::

    @bool run-pyflakes-on-write = True
    @bool syntax-error-popup = True
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.7">The @nobeautify directive suppresses beautification of the node in which it appears.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180126061429.8">.. _`pylint`: https://www.pylint.org/

Leo's pylint command runs `pylint`_ on all `@&lt;file&gt;` nodes in the selected trees.
Pylint runs in the background, so you can continue to use Leo while pylint runs.

These commands make it easier to use Leo's `reference .leo files`_. From time to time, developers needs to open reference Leo file and copy its content to and from their personal file.

These commands use a **separation node**, a top-level node** whose headline is::

    ---begin-private-area---
    
The body of the separation node contains the **.leo reference**, a path to the reference .leo file. Everything above this node is the **public part** of the outline.  Everything below this node is the **private part** of the outline.

**set-reference-file** selects the reference .leo file corresponding to the local .leo file. It creates the separation node if it doesn't exists, changing the .leo reference as needed.

**read-ref-file** reads the public part of this outline from the reference .leo file given in the separation node. **Warning**: This command **deletes all nodes above separation node**, recreating them from the reference file.

**update-ref-file** saves public part of this outline to reference .leo file.

You would typically execute the read-ref-file command after any git pull that changes any reference .leo file.  Similarly, you would typically execute the update-ref-file command before doing a git commit that changes a .leo file.

The CompareLeoOutlines class in leo/core/leoCompare.py allows scripts to generate outline-based diffs for arbitrarily many .leo files. Previously, only the git-diff command created outline-based diffs.

Here is an example script::

    import leo.core.leoCompare as leoCompare

    paths = [g.os_path_finalize_join('~/compare', z) for z in outlines]

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180226152825.1">I found Leo when I was looking for a replacement for ECCO (anyone remember that program?) I used ECCO for 15 years after it wasn't supported anymore and the core group of diehard users finally lost hope the program owners would open source the code.

Anyway, I don't remember how long ago that was; at least 10 years ago, as I recall. In most respects, Leo is a *major* improvement over ECCO and I don't regret the switch. However, the one thing I still miss about ECCO and wish there was a good Leo integration is the calendar. ECCO could print almost any kind of calendar, in practically any format on any size. I really miss that. There's no other PIM on the market that I know of that has that kind of flexibility.

Perhaps other Leo users figured out how to integrate their calendar(s) with Leo; I haven't and would love to know how (if it's possible).

<t tx="ekr.20180226153353.1">@language rest

g.app.backgroundProcessManager is the singleton instance of the BackgroundProcessManager (BPM) class. This class runs background processes, *without blocking Leo*. The BPM manages a queue of processes, and runs them *one at a time* so that their output remains separate.

BPM.start_process(c, command, kind, fn=None, shell=False) adds a process to the queue that will run the given command::

@language python

    bpm = g.app.backgroundProcessManager
    bpm.start_process(c, command='ls', kind='ls', shell=True)

@language rest

BM.kill(kind=None) kills all process with the given kind. If kind is None or 'all', all processes are killed.

You can add processes to the queue at any time. For example, you can rerun the 'pylint' command while a background process is running.

The BackgroundProcessManager is completely safe: all of its code runs in the main process.

**Running multiple processes simultaneously**

Only one process at a time should be producing output. All processes that *do* produce output should be managed by the singleton BPM instance.

To run processes that *don't* produce output, just call subprocess.Popen::

@language python

    import subprocess
    subprocess.Popen('ls', shell=True)

@language rest

You can run as many of these process as you like, without involving the BPM in any way

<t tx="ekr.20180226155008.1">Calling subprocess.popen is often simple and good. For example, the following executes the 'npm run dev' command in a given directory.  Leo continues, without waiting for the command to return::

    os.chdir(base_dir)
    subprocess.Popen('npm run dev', shell=True)

The following hangs Leo until the command completes::

    os.chdir(base_dir)
    proc = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)
    proc.communicate()

**Note**: 'cd directory' does not seem to work when run using subprocess.popen on Windows 10.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180226155010.1">Use g.execute_shell_commands is a thin wrapper around subprocess.popen.  It calls subprocess.popen once for every command in a list.  This function waits for commands that start with '&amp;'. Here it is::

        if g.isString(commands): commands = [commands]
        for command in commands:

            if trace: print('\n&gt;%s%s\n' % ('' if wait else '&amp;', command))
            proc = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)
            if wait: proc.communicate()

<t tx="ekr.20180303013046.1">I came about Leo because I was interested in Learning Python and some forum said that Leo, not Zope, was a superb showcase for this language. I found that it supported a form of literate programming, which I was already interesting into. I started to use it almost exclusively for writing, not for programming, from note keeping to even draft of my thesis, since 2005, when I found Leo, to 2015 and then I found Pharo and Roassal and the idea of software as a graph (https://vimeo.com/94724841)

I decided to create my own outliner with ideas of Leo, Jupyter, Smalltalk and others. These days I still use Leo for quick notes and probably I would use it again to deconstruct some large script or textual program. So, my path was Python -&gt; Zope -&gt; Leo -&gt; Outlining for Literate Programming -&gt; Writing -&gt; Pharo, Roassal -&gt; Reproducible research and data storytelling and visualization -&gt; Grafoscopio. Of course, some parts were traversed in parallel and I still try to combine ideas and communities from several places.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180303013355.1">I've been trying to recall my own path of discovery. No concrete memory has emerged, but it was somewhere in the intersection of being dissatisfied with wiki notes and mind/concept mapping, starting to learn python, and a multi-decade quest for the perfect text editor (1999-2004, 2010). Gmail says I subscribed to the Leo mailing list in 2009 with my first concrete contribution in August -- a Windows install recipe. Huh. I'm still doing that now!

In spite of the lengthy time since discovering Leo and bringing it into my permanent toolkit, it's still not front and centre for much of my activity. Onenote desktop is my primary writing and organizing tool (the web app is ...meh) and Pyzo the first stop for exploratory python. Much as I love text I'm still a strong graphic creature. My dream writing platform is all of the best parts of rich text &amp; media editing fused with Leo's node management and scripting. Bonus points if it's webby lets me punt Wordpress and all the other web content management things I've tried and discarded (jekyll, acrylamid, drupal, mindtouch, deki-wiki, twiki).

There is substantive aroma of my dream in the air right now, which is very exciting. :)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180303013437.1">I employed Leo for an oddball use case, which it addressed beautifully. 

How long ago did this start, perhaps 2005?

The job that I held then required that, without help from work infrastructure or from colleagues, I write tools for diagnosing and repairing problems with installations of a complicated software package and the many libraries it used. The package ran under Microsoft Windows, I had to ship the tools easily via e-mail, and they had to run easily, without requiring installation or uninstallation. 

In those less paranoid days, the flexible packaging method was a Windows Script Host file, in which Microsoft allowed scripts in the supported language of one's choice to call modules written in any other supported scripting language. Microsoft allowed the storage of multiple modules and data files in the WSH file; the format Microsoft employed for this was XML. 

The conventional approach would have been to use a commercial XML editor to build the file. XML editors were specialty products sold for huge sums to industrial combines. Commercial products were aimed at Big Enterprise Publishing with Big Enterprise Money, not at software development by a solitary programmer with a garden-variety PC and no budget. I needed to build my own editor, or I needed to write tools to pre-process each of my tools' source code and the source code for the library routines, then assemble the preprocessed code into the multiple WSFs. This would have been multiple tools, at least a preprocessor akin to the Unix "m4" command and an executable akin to Make, and those would need maintenance. I had no budget for buying software. What to use instead?  

Leo offered me a targeted IDE for Python with the ability to manage all my source code. It offered the PIM I needed to organize my development effort. 

I had to write scripts in Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBS), because Microsoft deployed it everywhere, and because a lot of modules I could use were written in VBScript. With that in mind, I added support for VBScript to Leo's syntax highlighting. Leo's architecture made that easy. 

Each of the multiple tools that I would write would end up in a WSF of its own. Using Leo's @file commands for the individual WSFs would steer me to use a preprocessor-plus-compiler-plus-Make toolkit, so instead I reached for Leo's heritage in Literate Programming: I used Leo's now-deprecated @root command instead of the @file family of commands, and forced Leo to Tangle the section of the outline required to generate a required WSF.

That allowed me to keep a straightforward correspondence between the section of the Leo file for each tool and the WSF for the tool itself: once I told Leo to Tangle the necessary section of its outline, I knew the resulting WSFs were correctly formatted and included exactly what I required, and nothing more. 

Because the the representation of a module within a WSF was XML, the source code for that module had to be encoded, or it had to be packaged specially so that the Windows Script Host software would handle it in its original form. I did not want to do the filtering, I wanted the outline to contain the unchanged file in a Leo node in a form that would guarantee its correct representation in the WSF. I was able to figure out how to surround the source code's node in the Leo outline in a few extra nodes that would allow me to use the source code exactly as it came. That made it painless for me to add new modules to to my library.  

In those days, Leo's GUI was built on the TKinter package that shipped with Python. That release of TKinter is not beautiful by any means, but its place as one of Python's Batteries Included meant that my entire development environment consisted of the installer for Python; the installer for the pywin32 extensions to Python; the installer for Leo; and the comparatively tiny LEO file that contained my tools' source code, the source code for the library routines, and all my notes. All that went on a single CD-RW, and I could install Python and pywin32 and Leo on a Windows computer in minutes and tweak my code as needed.

    @string theme-name &lt;name of theme file&gt;

**Important**: When using themes, it's best to disable all other theme-related settings in myLeoSettings.leo.

Leo looks for the named .leo file in the following order::

    ~  (The users home directory)
    ~/themes
    ~/.leo
    ~/.leo/themes
    leo/themes

Theme files should contain three settings that describe the theme::

@auto x.ipynb now "just works".

- I can change any cell in Jupyter and save the file.  If the corresponding .leo file is running the new code appears in the @auto tree.  Simple as that.

- I can also change the @auto tree.  The Jupyter web page will (I think) eventually reload automatically.  Or I can reload the page myself.  Simple as that.

It now feels Leonine to author in Leo (with all of Leo's organizing capabilities) and then render or run code in Jupyter.

**Other features**:

When writing, Leo uses @language directives to determine cell type.

When reading, Leo indents nodes based on body lines of the form:

    &lt;h1...9&gt;title&lt;/h1...9&gt;

Such markup affects Jupyter rendering, but the Leo headline of the node can be anything you want.

Leo now generates markdown section markup automatically, based on outline level and headlines.

Leo handles organizer nodes in the outline.

<t tx="ekr.20180501163005.1">The new insert-jupyter-toc and insert-markdown-toc commands produce a toc (table of contents) for in the selected node, at insert point of the body text.  They replace any selected text.

These two commands are almost identical.  They very only in the details of how they generate the url part of markdown links.  See Note 2 below.

Tip: These commands produce a toc only for the selected node and it's descendants, but that is not a real limitation.  For example, you can produce a complete toc for an @auto .ipynb tree by executing the command in the @auto node itself, then cutting and pasting the toc into the first child of the @auto node.

Notes

1. You must use the insert-jupyter-toc command inside .ipynb files.  The Jupyter online notebook is picky about what links it will accept.  In particular, case is important in url's.  You probably should use insert-markdown-toc for all other files.

2. Both commands clean both parts of markdown links, that is, the [*] part and the (*) part. It's not clear what characters can be allowed in general, but for now the rules are:

A. Within [*] parts, all non alphanums are removed, except ":" and "-" and blanks.
B. Same for (*) parts, except that blanks are converted to "-".

3. Similar logic is used in the exporter to clean section names.

The cleaning of markdown links is over-zealous, but it's not clear exactly what characters are valid.  In particular, html escapes will not work. 

4. These two commands are defined in Leo's core. They are completely separate from the @auto (importer/export) logic.

Summary

These two commands are important tools.  Please try them and report any problems or desired improvements.

I will be happy to allow more characters in markdown links, should you want them. Just let me know.

The insert-markdown-toc is a component of #767: Add markdown command similar to rst3 command.</t>

Marcel Franke showed how to use the recommended way of using git branches:
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/p_6ljMQL660/57Z8lYuQAAAJ

Here are his remarks, slightly edited:

- **master** is stable.
- **devel** is "mostly" stable.
- **feature branches** off devel can be wildly unstable.
- **release branches** are candidates for master, so should be stable. 

Everything new comes from devel and goes to devel. Devs **must** run unit tests before pushing to devel, so devel should usually be stable.

All experimental code should reside in a feature branch.

At all times, anyone can pull stable code from master.

Only the maintainer (EKR) is supposed to work on release or master, so nobody needs to hold back or knows what is going on in them. At all times everyone can happily hack on devel,  or better, their personal feature branches.

To prepare a new release,  the maintainer branches devel to a new branch, say 5.8.x.  The maintainer runs tests on it, and makes any last-minute fixes. To publish the release, the maintainer merges the release to master **and** to devel, then optionally deletes the release branch.

This visualization made it all clear to me:

This lesson discusses the *process* of making arbitrarily complex changes throughout a code base.
  It's an elaboration of Lesson 1: Think process, not knowledge, but it's worth reading because it contains helpful hints about tackling *any* big project.  I used this general method when making Leo's code base work with Python 3 as well as Python 2.

The grand summary:

1. Study the code first with clone-find commands.
2. Let python crashes &amp; failed unit tests guide you.

In detail:

1. Create a new git branch for the work.

2. Create a **global master switch**that separates and marks the old and new versions of the code. This is a boolean.  It selects the new code if True and the old code otherwise.  We say the switch is either in the "**new**" position or the "**legacy**" position.

- **All unit tests should continue to pass when the switch selects legacy code.**
- **All pushes should have the legacy code selected until every works.**

These two requirements make it safe to pause work on the project.

3. Make sure you understand what needs to be done.  Use the clone find commands to answer any and all questions about the code and how it should be changed.

4. Make the fundamental changes required, **without worrying about the consequences**.

For the "keys" branch I changed the representation of settings so that they are NewLeoKey objects.

5.  With the switch in the "new" position, run a test copy of Leo.

Because of step 4, we *expect* crashes.  Fix each as they happen, separating the old and new code with a test on the switch.  Repeat this step until no crashes happen.

When this phase works, set the switch to "legacy", re-run all unit tests, and commit the code.

6. For the "keys" branch, getting through startup is only half the task.  When I type a key I *expect* more crashes.  I'll follow step 5 until no crashes happen when I type various key combination.

Again, I'll set the switch to "legacy", re-run all unit tests and commit the code.

7. When normal operation appears to work with the switch in the "new" position, **run all unit tests** and fix any crashes or unit tests failures.

Now you can commit the code with the switch in the "new" position.

8. At this point you can start eating your own dog food.  When satisfied that the code is stable enough, you can do the following:

- Remove the switch and all code disabled when the switch is in the "legacy" position.
- Run all unit tests.
- Continue to eat your own dog food.
- Commit the branch to "devel" when all seems well.

That's the process.  It's extremely effective.  You don't have to remember your changes because a cff on the switch should yield *all* changed code.  Naturally, you can make clones of nodes containing the most important changes.</t>

From this post: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/SjHfXepxiTo
Not everyone agrees with everything I say here.

This LeoU discussion discusses the present code base only. #883 (a low priority item) discusses ways in which the tree of vnodes could be decoupled from c, the Commands instance. 

**The Position class**

The Position class concerns itself only with traversing the tree. The position class contains no node-related data.  In order to insert top-level nodes, methods of the Position class gets access to c.hiddenRootNode via p.v.context. 

**The VNode class**

The VNode class contains all data in an outline, as well as crucial, low-level operations on those data. There is no other place to store node-related data. 

The VNode class is one of the foundations of Leo's scripting. As a result, *none* of the ivars or methods of the VNode class can change in any way. That is, all of the ivars of the VNode class are "official". Scripts can, and do, access these ivars directly. Perhaps the "context" kwarg of `VNode.__init__` should just be called "c", but that can't be done now.

Theoretically, it would be possible to add new kwargs to VNode methods, but that is extremely unlikely. It would also be possible to add new ivars to the VNode class, but uA's make that unnecessary.

The properties of the VNode class, v.b, v.h, v.gnx, v.u, allow higher-level access to various VNode ivars, but in some cases Leo's code accesses the corresponding ivars directly, for greater performance.

**Interaction with other classes**

The v.context ivar is controversial. In fact, the v.context ivar is completely benign. It has never caused problems, and it never will. It does not, in any significant way, make the VNode class dependent on any other class. It has no harmful architectural consequences.

Yes, the FileCommands class must know about gnx's, but *the converse is not true*.  The VNode class knows nothing about how other classes use gnx's.  The FileCommands class creates VNode instances without knowing *anything* about low-level VNode methods.

The VNode class is, in fact, an excellent example of information hiding.  The boundary between the VNode class is well defined and well enforced.

**Possible improvements**

1. A new c.new_vnode method could help instantiate VNodes::

    def new_vnode(self, gnx=None):
        c = self
        return leoNodes.VNode(context=c, gnx=gnx)

The (small) advantage is that clients of c.new_vnode(gnx) would no longer need to import leo.core.leoNodes.

2. The  v.saveCursorAndScroll and v.restoreCursorAndScroll could be moved elsewhere. At present, these methods cause no problems, but moving them would be part of #883.</t>

Relying on settings nodes in unitTest.leo risks creating hard-to-find dependencies between seemingly unrelated unit tests.  Instead, unit tests can follow the pattern for, say, `@test add python comments`::


    w = c.frame.body.wrapper
    p = g.findNodeInTree(c,p,'python')
    assert p,'not found: python'
    # Save the initial value of the setting.
    old_indent = c.config.getBool('indent_added_comments',default=True)

        (
            True,
            '@language python\ndef spam():\n    pass\n\n# after',
            '@language python\ndef spam():\n    # pass\n\n# after',
        ),
        (
            False,
            '@language python\ndef spam():\n    pass\n\n# after',
            '@language python\ndef spam():\n#     pass\n\n# after',
        ),
    )
    try:

            val = c.config.getBool('indent_added_comments')
            assert indent == val, (repr(indent), repr(val))

        c.config.set(p, 'bool', 'indent_added_comments', old_indent)
        val = c.config.getBool('indent_added_comments')

This code saves and restores the actual value of the `@bool indent_added_comments` setting. It uses::

    c.config.set(c.config.set(None, 'bool', 'indent_added_comments', indent, warn=False)

to set the setting to the value of 'indent'.  Note that c.config.set is seldom (never?) used in Leo's core.</t>

I recommend using the organization of leo/themes/EKRDark.leo as a guide. **Note**: Syntax coloring settings are required because they are *not* used in the css.

To avoid confusion, it's best if theme .leo files contain no **unbound settings**. This will ensure that the appearance of a theme does not unwittingly depend on settings in myLeoSettings.leo.

**Important**: Theme devs should set the following **theme description settings**::

    @string theme_name   # crucial
    @bool color_theme_is_dark
    @string color_theme = ekr_dark

These settings ensure that relative urls (including ":/" syntax are resolved properly in css, and that icons are found in the proper directories.

**Icons boxes should have constant width**.  Otherwise, the variable indentation of the rest of the headline appears to represent variable outline structure, which is highly confusing.

Programming is *much* easier than you might think.

Many of Leo's most important devs made major contributions to Leo without asking me a single question.  Do they have super powers?  No, they don't.

But they do know the secret of programming: **Simple processes, endlessly repeated, suffice to find, understand and change *any* software**.  And Leo simplifies these techniques even further.  Here they are...

**Basic skill/process 1: Familiarize yourself with the code**

For any project you want to know what files exist.  When studying other people's code I use a recursive import script https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/846 to create a tree of files. The goal is just to have a *vague* understanding of what files are involved. Don't even think about remember details.

It's even easier with Leo.  LeoPy.py contains Leo's sources.  Peruse this outline, seeing what `@file` nodes it contains.

*Don't make a big deal about this step*. It should just take 5 or 10 minutes. Look *only* at files that interest you. In those files you will probably want to look briefly at the top-level classes in the files that interest you. You will likely repeat this step many times, adding a little to your understanding each time.

**Basic skill/process 2: Learn what to search for**

We devs often want to change how commands work.  You can usually find the top-level code for a command simply by searching for the command's name, in single quotes.

To find the definition of a method, function or class, simply control-click on it.  That will start a search for def x and class x.  If that doesn't work, a cff (clone-find-all-flattened) search on a name will find all uses of that name in the present outline.

**Basic skill/process 3: Look for helpers in child nodes**

With Leo outlines **it's natural to put a method's helpers in child nodes**. I usually forget implementation details, but the children of a node usually contain most of the details.

**Basic skill/process 4: Use clones to organize and remember your work**

When working on a project I make create an organizer node as the last top-level node of the outline.  This node will typically contain a link to the github issue.  I make clones of all relevant nodes and move them so they are clones of the organizer node.  For complex projects I may create subsidiary organizer nodes, like "changed", "reference", etc.

When a project is done (or suspended), I move the project's organizer node so it is the last child of *another* organizer node called "Recent Code". This hides all work except the what I am, this minute, working on.  This is important: it hides details and lessens distractions.

**Summary**

The easy processes just described form the basis for programming workflow.

*Expect to repeat these processes many times*.  Don't worry if not everything is clear at first.</t>

I recommend using github issues to track your work. This is especially true for Leo devs.  You want other people to be able to follow and comment on your work.

The convention is to have the first comment for any issue contain an up-to-date summary of the status of the issue.  I have found that it is useful to continually edit the first comment.</t>

Here are the basics of debugging with Leo:

**g.trace**

`g.trace(*args, **kwargs)` prints its arguments to the console.  I use g.trace all throughout Leo's code base.

**g.pdb**

`g.pdb()` invokes a version of python's pdb debugger, https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html, adapted to Leo's Qt gui.  I use g.pdb only rarely, when g.trace doesn't tell me enough.

**Using `@`button/command nodes as a testing framework**

This is the so-called stupendous Aha:
http://leoeditor.com/FAQ.html#what-is-the-stupendous-aha-and-why-does-it-matter
This can save you a lot of time.</t>

​All devs must run all unit tests before commit anything. Here's how:

- Open leo/test/unitTest.leo in a console.
- The "Active Unit Tests" node should already be selected. If not, select it.
- Do Alt-4. It is bound in the file to run-selected-unit-tests-locally.

**Important**: Some unit tests may fail on your environment.  Don't worry about them.  You need only ensure that your new code causes no *other* unit tests to fail.  If in doubt, ask on leo-editor.</t>

c.recursiveImport is a wrapper on the RecursiveImportController class.​ ​You can find the related code by doing a regex cff (ignoring case) on ​ ​"recursive?import".

Here is how to use c.recursiveImport::

    c.recursiveImport(
        dir_ = &lt;&lt; path to root directory &gt;&gt;,
            # You must expand ~ yourself
        add_path=True,
        kind = '@clean', # '@clean', @nosent','@auto','@file'
        recursive = True,
        safe_at_file = False,
        theTypes = ['.py',],
    )

I like to import to @clean and set safe_at_file = False, but *before doing that* I create a git repo for the to-be-imported directory and check in all the .py files. That way I can track any changes that get made, and revert them if need be.</t>

The first non-blank, non-comment line of the node `@menu Recent Files' can contain an alternate (translated) menu name.

You should not just change the headline of the node: it should remain unchanged. Indeed, the point of this item is that Leo has to know which item is the Recent Files item, so some other way was needed to specify an alternate name.</t>

By the term architecture I mean the design of Leo's modules and classes.

**Information hiding**

Leo's design is based on the thinking of Glenford Meyers. Let's use the word component to mean either a Python module or class.

We devs must be able to change the implementation of a component without affecting any other code. This has been true throughout Leo's 20+ years of history. This is the foundation on which Leo is built.

**Principle 1**: Each class should concern itself with one, easily defined "area of concern".

Modules should contain related classes. All components should have short, simple descriptions, no matter how complex they are internally.

**Principle 2**: Components should know as little as possible about the internal details of other components.

Components have well-defined boundaries. The inside of a component contains the implementation. The outside of a component is its API.

Changes to the API can break code. However, knowing about the existence of a component's high-level methods does not (usually) blur the boundaries of a component!

In most cases, components should know nothing about the ivars and low-level methods. However, components can freely use the so-called official ivars of other classes. These official ivars are highly unlikely ever to change. And they are useful. We wouldn't want to require long-winded alternatives to, say, c.frame.body.wrapper.

**Class design: inheritance vs instantiation**

Leo uses the "has-a" pattern, rather than the "is-a" class pattern. That is, Leo gains access to the capabilities of other classes by instantiating the other classes rather than being subclasses of other classes. The "has-a" pattern is a personal preference of mine, and is now pretty much baked into Leo.

The "has-a" pattern completely insulates classes from the internal details of other classes. There is no need to worry about clashing ivars, or _ ivars, etc. Otoh, the "has-a" pattern results in more complex startup code. Imo, that "extra" complexity is well worthwhile.</t>

- If the original name contains an underscore, say x_y, the second search will be for the camelCase version, xY.

- Otherwise, we assume the name may be camelCase, say xY, and we attempt to convert it to x_y.

A second search is attempted only if the converted name is different from the original.  In particular, names starting with a leading underscore are never converted.

The new setting: @bool find-def-creates-clones (default False) controls whether a clone-find-flattened command is used to show all matching definitions. This setting has no effect when only one definition is found.</t>

#684 Envisages creating a browser gui for Leo, but that's not a high priority at present.

The following projects are **highly risky** and may be **less useful** than might appear at first.  If you are interested in either project, please make yourself known to Leo's core devs **before** doing any programming work. See the post [Leo can be embedded in VS Code if...](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/uESWp-eL8AY) for more details.

**Dubious Project 1**: Leo can be embedded in VS Code (or other platform) if:

a) Somebody (not one of Leo's present devs) takes full responsibility for doing so.
b) All appropriate unit tests pass.
c) Terry and I approve.

The post [ENB: Serious doubts about embedding Leo](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/4kYSK-aIHRg/o0ejILh1AgAJ) tells why trying to embed Leo in another IDE might be a big mistake:

- Embedding Leo in any IDE would be a huge and risky project.
- Such a project would distract us Leo devs, and burden us with endless support.
- Embedding Leo would be less useful than it might seem.
- Leo has its own strengths. Many don't translate easily to other IDE's.

**Dubious Project 2**: Leo can be rewritten in JavaScript (or other language) if:

a) Somebody (not one of Leo's present devs) takes full responsibility for doing so.
b) All appropriate unit tests pass.
c) Leo's python API remains completely unchanged.
d) Terry and I approve.

The post [ENB: Why python will remain Leo's future](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/leo-editor/EaAX7R3_3N0/jKuCjwcuCgAJ) tells why rewriting Leo's core would likely be a mistake. Python is:

- Best for users as the simplest and most flexible scripting language.
- The basis for Leo's API.
- Able to support scripting in any language.</t>

_Strictly speaking this is an upstream issue and isn't Leo's problem, but prospective Leo users run into it, so lets document the problem and the workarounds. From mailing list:_

    VR&gt; PyEnchant is now also available as a wheel for Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.x. - See
    VR&gt;
    VR&gt; * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyenchant/2.0.0

Unfortunately pyenchant binaries via pip are not available for all platforms, most notably missing is Windows 64bit Python. The issue is 3 years old so a solution doesn't seem to be imminent.

I could add an IF-THEN to setup.py to install it for supported platforms, but have hesitated this far because it would add yet another special case to the install instructions.

I put some .leo files into a git repo. I open a .leo file and change nothing but save it again, it will be marked as changed in the repo. `git diff` shows that many lines have changed. I checked the diffs, and typically these changes are about accessing time etc.

How to make .leo files happy in a git repository? I mean, if nothing about the content changes, these files will keep clean to a git repo. Or could I use git only to trace the changes of outline nodes?</t>

I have noticed some methods that are not mentioned in documentation nor used in leoSettings.leo.
We should either remove them or document them properly. 

Here is a suspect list:
1. `doAbbrev` and `parseAbbrevLine`
2. I am not 100% sure about this, but shouldn't `doOutlineData` return 'skip'?
3. `doPage`  empty method, can't figure why?

I am working on standalone script for analyzing settings outlines and I want to be clear on what kind of settings are to be supported and which can be skipped in new code.</t>

**Update**: I think it's time to do this, while I am making other changes to Leo's code base.

This issue records my thoughts here to complete [recent discussions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/wMlURDDDUvY). To create a stand-alone tree of VNodes the following would be required:

- [ ]Redirect all generators in the node c.Generators on corresponding new Position generators.  There are only 5 such methods.

- [ ] Move v.saveCursorAndScroll and v.restoreCursorAndScroll into the Commands class.

- [ ]Create a new GnxManager class, accessible via g.app.gnxManager.

At minimum, the GnxManager class would be a straightforward refactoring of the NodeIndices class in leoNodes.py.  However, the new GnxManager might also manage a global cache of already-generated gnx's. This might ensure that *different instances* of Leo could not possibly allocate (on a local machine) conflicting gnx's.

At present, at.readPostPass and its helpers check for conflicting gnx's.  The GnxManager class might simplify this code, or it might be a "belt and suspenders" check.</t>

I am writing these notes why the details are fresh in my mind.

The latest version of Anaconda is [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Older versions are [here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/).

Install the 32-bit version of Anaconda. pyenchant does not work with 64-bit installs.
- The 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Anaconda 4.0 and 4.1 **do** work.
- The 64-bit versions of Anaconda 4.0 and 4.1 **don't** work with pyenchant (spell checker)
- **No** version of Anaconda 4.2 works.  They crash and don't draw the tree properly. This is apparently a PyQt 5.6 bug.

When installing any version of Anaconda:
- Check "Install for just me".  Installing for all users creates registry problems later(!)
- Check "update sys.path".

I later rearrange sys.path order so that my scripts folder (`c:\scripts`) is first.

Test: e and e2 work at this point.

pip2/3 install markdown: Test: markdown test works.
pip2/3 install pyenchant: Test: spell tab visible.  Hurray!
pip2/3 install pylint: Test pylint -a works.
pip2/3 install pyinstaller (needed only when distributing Leo).

pylint sometimes can not import the leo module.  As a workaround, my sitecustomize.py files add the leo folder to sys.path.  This should be addressed in Leo's pylint support code.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180523095243.23">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/322
The new javascript importer is a template for other importers.  This issue describes what would be done.  As such, is an information item as well as an enhancement request. Much of the following has been taken from [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/Ct3ZKqTo_KE) on leo-editor. 

Most of the code resides in the `JavaScriptScanner` class, and its helpers, the `Block` class and the `ScanState` classes. Imo, these classes are the simplest thing that could possibly work. These three classes form a framework for writing any importer.

We could imagine a `GeneralScanState` class that scans input line by line.  A call to

```
    BaseScanner.new_scanner(self)
```

would instantiate the GeneralScanState using the _already existing_ ivars of each scanner. Token info is _already_ found in these ivars:

```
    .blockCommentDelim1/2
    .blockDelim1/2
    .lineCommentDelim/2
    .outerBlockDelim1/2
```

None of the following `BaseScanner` ivars would be needed:

```
    .classTags
    .extraIdChars
    .functionTags
    .outerBlockEndsDecls
    .sigHeadExtraTokens
    .sigFailTokens
```

These ivars are pure hacks.  They modify `BaseScanner.scan_helper` and various code-generation methods in `basescanner.py`.

The new scheme would likely bypass _all_ the code generation routines in the `BaseScanner` class. Instead, the new code just creates child nodes for each block.  Nothing could be simpler, or more natural.

Finally, the new code uses a custom check method.  The existing code parameterizes the checks made in `BaseScanner.check`, but for experimentation it is quite handy simply to override the base class method entirely.

**Summary**

Import code will never be trivial, and special cases will have to be made for some languages.  For example, a completely new version of the `ScanState` class would be needed for Python, because blocks are delimited by indentation, not delimiters.

I would certainly have used the present scheme for all importers if I had discovered it earlier.  For now, I plan to convert an importer to the new scheme only if serious bugs are reported against it.</t>

From [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/Gv6D-h8Mcag/wbBEK9gfCgAJ)

**EKR**: It looks like json.dumps may have problems with p.v.unknownAttributes

**Terry**: In theory yes, in practice not so much, although still a potential problem.

The leo_cloud plugin stores outlines (well, subtrees, without expansion info. etc.) in JSON.  The two issues I found were todo.py storing datetime dates, and the tags plugin storing sets.

Python's JSON module supports converting types on write - easy to make set a list, and I think I converted dates to YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS format.

Then you have to handle them on read - so I tweaked tags to convert to set, and todo was already reading text dates, seeing the datetime.dates had been a problem with different pickle versions.

So I guess in general I didn't find actual problems, but there's still the issue that currently someone can do:
```python
p.v.u['pantry'] = {
   ('beans', 'aug'): 17,
   ('beans', 'jun'): 12,
   ('flour', 'jul'): 11,
   ('flour', 'aug'): 10,
}
```
That just doesn't work in JSON.

I don't think we want to go down the track of letting users register JSON read/write helpers for certain keys in p.v.u.  *Maybe* we could handle the case of ints/floats/tuples/(frozen sets) as keys by converting to/from string representations.</t>

LeoVue is Joe Orr's prototype of Leo using vue.js. First announced [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/50SZd4136iM/owhCnBqcDAAJ). Joe's [leo-examples page](https://github.com/kaleguy/leo-examples) discusses how to run leovue on a local machine. The git repo is [here](https://github.com/kaleguy/leovue).

I can now successfully build leovue on both Ubuntu and Windows 10. **Note**: Before doing so I simulated a clean install by *uninstalling* java, node.js and a previous copy of leovue.  Uninstalling node.js involved deleting ~AppData/npm and ~AppData/npm-cache.

Here is how to install and run the demo. Note: *installing Java is no longer necessary*.  

**1. install node.js**

On Linux, do the following.  Note the **second** sudo in the curl line!!!

    anywhere&gt;sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo bash -
    anywhere&gt;sudo apt-get install nodejs

On Windows, install nodejs from an executable installer.  I used from node-v8.9.4-x64.msi

**2. Install global npm packages**

     anywhere&gt;sudo npm install -g node-gyp@3.6.2

LeoVue requires a web server to run. Either install it on your server or run it locally with http-server:

    anywhere&gt;sudo npm install -g http-server

**3. Download LeoVue itself**

Do the following where you have permissions. say in ~/repo. It will create a leovue folder.

    ~/repo&gt;git clone https://github.com/kaleguy/leovue.git

**4. Install packages within LeoVue**

    leovue&gt;npm install --silent
        # --silent inhibits the spammy dependency tree.

**6. Run leovue**
        
    # serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
    leovue&gt;npm run dev

**Important**: Be sure to allow all in noscript or other ad blocker.

**Note**: `npm run dev` is quite slow. Maybe 20 seconds on a fast machine. Eventually the console should show: `&gt; Listening at http://localhost:8080`

**7. Building the production version**

The following also works (it's quite slow):
        
    # build for production with minification
    leovue&gt;npm run build

    # build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
    leovue&gt;npm run build --report

At the end of the build, this message appears:

    Tip: built files are meant to be served over an HTTP server.
    Opening index.html over file:// won't work.

**From tscv11**: The script 'leo4sqlite' is now online using leovue. The syntax highlighting works well.
I'm looking forward to trying some of leovue's more advanced capabilities. The leovue/leo4sqlite demo lives [here](https://tscv11.github.io/leo4sqlite/#/t/23/)</t>

- Install [java](https://java.com/en/), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [electron](https://electronjs.org/), and [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/).
  Install node.js and leiningen *globally* with the -g option.
  See #703 for detailed instructions about installing and running electron.
- Build the app *once only*: `leocljs&gt;lein descjop-once-dev`
- Run the app using two *separate* consoles:

    - **Console 1**: `leocljs&gt;lein descjop-figwheel`
       This monitors and builds leiningen apps.
       A prompt will appear when the app loads.
       Don't close console 1 before closing console 2.

    - **Console2**:  `leocljs&gt;electron app/dev`
       This runs the app.

**Notes**:

1. In src_front/leo_front/core.cljs file at line 379 is `(get-leo-doc "line-numbering.leo")` Change "line-numbering.leo" to match the Leo file you have placed in app/dev/.

2. Usually you start with: `(in-ns 'leo-front/core)` You must be running the cljs app, otherwise the console will hang.</t>

This is an ongoing info Item.  Here are some preliminary ideas:

**Settings**

I did like the way VS Code handles key bindings.  In particular, settings can be associated with events, not just panes as in Leo. This might be a new direction for Leo.

**Non-outline tabs**

Many IDE's, including VS Code, can display web pages using the entire window. The idea is to allow the VR pane (or an external file) to occupy the entire window, that is, an entire tab.  This would allow Leo to display .md files "natively" in the entire window, rather than squashed into whatever space is allocated to the VR pane. Similarly, one of Kent's favorite requests, a "flattened" view of an entire file, would also be a good candidate for displaying in the full window.  And so on.

**Pylint**

- Add a setting to run Pylint whenever saving a .py file.
- Pylint errors should also create clickable links, if they don't already.

**Other panes**

Most IDE's support lots and lots of other views.  It's an open question how useful these would be in Leo.

**Integrated debugger**

Single-stepping through code *in Leo's outline* would be a good feature to have. The recent work on jedi auto-completion shows how to associate line numbers in the external file with lines in each node of the file.  It's actually very easy and fast to do, which I had not realized until this week.</t>

From [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/ySG0WtcOdgI/OTtF5ldFBQAJ): The latest release of VS Code includes the idea of FileSystemProviders that allow you to open editors via various [Universal Resource Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).

You would have to develop a leo: or maybe leoFS: scheme to let you open nodes, and probably a LSP to keep node updated in Leo, but it would be a way to let VS Code do editing. There is a memory based example memFS [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jrieken.vscode-memfs).</t>

**Scripting**

- #760: Optionally use ipython in the python_console plugin.
- #729: Ongoing: support scripting (execute-script) in more languages
- #561: Making Leo a client of Jupyter, by communicating with its kernel
    Add convenient access to jupyter kernels.

- #760: Optionally use ipython in the python_console plugin
- #682: Use live objects for autocompletion in the valuespace plugin
- #447: VR plugin should be improved.
   Support `@`treeview directives so the rendered output of a tree of Leo nodes
   looks like a jupyter notebook.

**Gui**

- #684: Create a browser gui for Leo
- #667: Pipes into the body pane's widget
- #588: Make node attributes visible, with support in Leo's core

**Update**: Imo, little, if any, truly sclerotic code remains in Leo.  In particular, naming conventions replace unnecessary asserts.  The remaining assert are benign.  Many are a form of documentation.

[This post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/Ejf3tif-eJs/cT3ZJINIBAAJ) lists Leo's flexible and sclerotic aspects:

- Fixed: **Sclerotic**: Leo's key-handling code. #858 tells how to solve this problem.

- Won't Do: **Sclerotic**: Leo's @shortcuts nodes mix all pane bindings together.
  Instead, use inheritable  `@data &lt;pane&gt;-shortcut` nodes 

- **Sclerotic**: Leo's concrete gui code.
  It might be possible to use a local browser as Leo's rendering engine, while having Leo remain a desktop app. It would be easy to simulate the needed parts of the javascript DOM in Leo's API.

- **Partially sclerotic**: Leo's rendering tools.
  We are suffering from [LeoVue](https://github.com/kaleguy/leovue#leo-vue) envy.

- **Partially sclerotic**: Leo's attribute handling.

It's easy to use LaTex with Leo. This info item tells how.

**Create external files**: `@clean` create an external file without Leo sentinels, that is, without extra LaTex/tex comment lines.  Leo will automagically incorporate changes you make outside Leo into the `@clean` outline.

Leo may place newly-added lines at the boundary of two nodes in the "wrong" node. If that happens, just move the line to the correct node and save the outline.  Leo will remember what you did.  The next time you open the outline, the moved line will be in the correct node.

**Automate your work flow**: g.execute_shell_commands executes commands without hanging Leo. For example:
```python
g.execute_shell_commands([
    '"C:\Program Files (x86)\SumatraPDF\SumatraPDF.exe",
    'latex_test.pdf'
]) 
```
The argument to g.execute_shell_commands can be a string containing a *single* command, or a list one or more commands, as shown above. 

You can put calls to g.execute_shell_commands into an `@button` or `@command` node to create visible buttons and/or commands that you can execute by name from the minibuffer.</t>

Relying on settings nodes in unitTest.leo risks creating hard-to-find dependencies between seemingly unrelated unit tests.  Instead, unit tests can follow the pattern for, say, `@test add python comments`:

```python
w = c.frame.body.wrapper
p = g.findNodeInTree(c,p,'python')
assert p,'not found: python'
# Save the initial value of the setting.
old_indent = c.config.getBool('indent_added_comments',default=True)
table = (
    (
        True,
        '@language python\ndef spam():\n    pass\n\n# after',
        '@language python\ndef spam():\n    # pass\n\n# after',
    ),
    (
        False,
        '@language python\ndef spam():\n    pass\n\n# after',
        '@language python\ndef spam():\n#     pass\n\n# after',
    ),
)
try:
    for indent, s1, expected in table:
        # Step 1: set the setting.
        c.config.set(None, 'bool', 'indent_added_comments', indent, warn=False)
        val = c.config.getBool('indent_added_comments')
        assert indent == val, (repr(indent), repr(val))
        # Step 2: set p.b and the insert point.
        c.selectPosition(p)
        p.b = s1
        i = p.b.find('pass')
        assert i &gt; -1,'fail1: %s' % (repr(p.b))
        w.setSelectionRange(i,i+4)
        # Step 3: test add-comments
        c.addComments()
        assert p.b == expected, ('indent: %5s got:\n%r\nexpected:\n%r' % (indent, p.b, expected))
finally:
    # Restore the initial value of the setting.
    c.config.set(p, 'bool', 'indent_added_comments', old_indent)
    val = c.config.getBool('indent_added_comments')
```
This code saves and restores the actual value of the `@bool indent_added_comments` setting. It uses:
```python
 c.config.set(c.config.set(None, 'bool', 'indent_added_comments', indent, warn=False)
```
to set the setting to the value of 'indent'.  Note that c.config.set is seldom (never?) used in Leo's core.</t>

This lesson discusses the *process* of making arbitrarily complex changes throughout a code base.  It's an elaboration of [Lesson 1: Think process, not knowledge](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/817), but it's worth reading because it contains helpful hints about tackling *any* big project.  I used this general method when making Leo's code base work with Python 3 as well as Python 2.

The grand summary:

1. Study the code first with clone-find commands.
2. Let python crashes &amp; failed unit tests guide you.

For example, here is how I am doing [#858: Rewrite Leo's key handling &amp; key binding code](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/858):

1. Create a new git branch for the work, in this case, "keys".

2. Create a **global master switch**that separates and marks the old and new versions of the code. This is a boolean.  It selects the new code if True and the old code otherwise.  We say the switch is either in the "**new**" position or the "**legacy**" position.

- **All unit tests should continue to pass when the switch selects legacy code.**
- **All pushes should have the legacy code selected until every works.**

These two requirements make it safe to pause work on the project.

3. Make sure you understand what needs to be done.  Use the clone find commands to answer any and all questions about the code and how it should be changed.

4. Make the fundamental changes required, **without worrying about the consequences**.

For the "keys" branch I changed the representation of settings so that they are NewLeoKey objects.

5.  With the switch in the "new" position, run a test copy of Leo.

Because of step 4, we *expect* crashes.  Fix each as they happen, separating the old and new code with a test on the switch.  Repeat this step until no crashes happen.

When this phase works, set the switch to "legacy", re-run all unit tests, and commit the code.

6. For the "keys" branch, getting through startup is only half the task.  When I type a key I *expect* more crashes.  I'll follow step 5 until no crashes happen when I type various key combination.

Again, I'll set the switch to "legacy", re-run all unit tests and commit the code.

7. When normal operation appears to work with the switch in the "new" position, **run all unit tests** and fix any crashes or unit tests failures.

Now you can commit the code with the switch in the "new" position.

8. At this point you can start eating your own dog food.  When satisfied that the code is stable enough, you can do the following:

- Remove the switch and all code disabled when the switch is in the "legacy" position.
- Run all unit tests.
- Continue to eat your own dog food.
- Commit the branch to "devel" when all seems well.

That's the process.  It's extremely effective.  You don't have to remember your changes because a cff on the switch should yield *all* changed code.  Naturally, you can make clones of nodes containing the most important changes.</t>

Marcel Franke [explained](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/p_6ljMQL660/57Z8lYuQAAAJ) the recommended way of using git branches. Here are his remarks, slightly edited:

- **master** is stable.
- **devel** is "mostly" stable.
- **feature branches** off devel can be wildly unstable.
- **release branches** are candidates for master, so should be stable. 

Everything new comes from devel and goes to devel. Devs **must** run unit tests before pushing to devel, so devel should usually be stable.

All experimental code should reside in a feature branch.

At all times, anyone can pull stable code from master.

Only the maintainer (EKR) is supposed to work on release or master, so nobody needs to hold back or knows what is going on in them. At all times everyone can happily hack on devel,  or better, their personal feature branches.

To prepare a new release,  the maintainer branches devel to a new branch, say 5.7.x.  The maintainer runs tests on it, and makes any last-minute fixes. To publish the release, the maintainer merges the release to master **and** to devel, then optionally deletes the release branch.

This visualization made it all clear to me:

<t tx="ekr.20180523101514.3">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/891

From [this post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/SjHfXepxiTo). Not everyone agrees with everything I say here.

This LeoU discussion discusses the present code base only. #883 (a low priority item) discusses ways in which the tree of vnodes could be decoupled from c, the Commands instance. 

**The Position class**

The Position class concerns itself only with traversing the tree. The position class contains no node-related data.  In order to insert top-level nodes, methods of the Position class gets access to c.hiddenRootNode via p.v.context. 

**The VNode class**

The VNode class contains all data in an outline, as well as crucial, low-level operations on those data. There is no other place to store node-related data. 

The VNode class is one of the foundations of Leo's scripting. As a result, *none* of the ivars or methods of the VNode class can change in any way. That is, all of the ivars of the VNode class are "official". Scripts can, and do, access these ivars directly. Perhaps the "context" kwarg of `VNode.__init__` should just be called "c", but that can't be done now.

Theoretically, it would be possible to add new kwargs to VNode methods, but that is extremely unlikely. It would also be possible to add new ivars to the VNode class, but uA's make that unnecessary.

The properties of the VNode class, v.b, v.h, v.gnx, v.u, allow higher-level access to various VNode ivars, but in some cases Leo's code accesses the corresponding ivars directly, for greater performance.

**Interaction with other classes**

The v.context ivar is controversial. In fact, the v.context ivar is completely benign. It has never caused problems, and it never will. It does not, in any significant way, make the VNode class dependent on any other class. It has no harmful architectural consequences.

Yes, the FileCommands class must know about gnx's, but *the converse is not true*.  The VNode class knows nothing about how other classes use gnx's.  The FileCommands class creates VNode instances without knowing *anything* about low-level VNode methods.

The VNode class is, in fact, an excellent example of information hiding.  The boundary between the VNode class is well defined and well enforced.

**Possible improvements**

1. A new c.new_vnode method could help instantiate VNodes:
```python
def new_vnode(self, gnx=None):
    c = self
    return leoNodes.VNode(context=c, gnx=gnx)
```
The (small) advantage is that clients of c.new_vnode(gnx) would no longer need to import leo.core.leoNodes.

2. The  v.saveCursorAndScroll and v.restoreCursorAndScroll could be moved elsewhere. At present, these methods cause no problems, but moving them would be part of #883.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180523101514.4">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/890

By the term **architecture** I mean the design of Leo's modules and classes. 

**Information hiding**

Leo's design is based on the thinking of [Glenford Meyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenford_Myers).  Let's use the word **component** to mean either a Python module or class.

We devs *must* be able to change the implementation of a component *without* affecting any other code.  This has been true throughout Leo's 20+ years of history. This is the foundation on which Leo is built.

**Principle 1**: Each class should concern itself with one, easily defined "area of concern".

Modules should contain related classes.  All components should have short, simple *descriptions*, no matter how complex they are internally.

**Principle 2**: Components should know as little as possible about the internal details of other components.

Components have well-defined **boundaries**.  The **inside** of a component contains the implementation.  The **outside** of a component is its API.

Changes to the API can break code. However, knowing about the *existence* of a component's high-level methods does *not* (usually) blur the boundaries of a component!

In most cases, components should know *nothing* about the ivars and low-level methods.  However, components can freely use the so-called **official ivars** of other classes.  These official ivars are highly unlikely ever to change.  And they are useful.  We wouldn't want to require long-winded alternatives to, say, c.frame.body.wrapper.

**Class design: inheritance vs instantiation**

Leo uses the "has-a" pattern, rather than the "is-a" class pattern. That is, Leo gains access to the capabilities of other classes by instantiating the other classes rather than being subclasses of other classes. The "has-a" pattern is a personal preference of mine, and is now pretty much baked into Leo.

The "has-a" pattern *completely* insulates classes from the internal details of other classes.  There is no need to worry about clashing ivars, or _ ivars, etc. Otoh, the "has-a" pattern results in more complex startup code.  Imo, that "extra" complexity is well worthwhile.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180523101514.5">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/837

​All devs must run all unit tests before commit anything. Here's how:

- Open leo/test/unitTest.leo in a console.
- The "Active Unit Tests" node should already be selected. If not, select it.
- Do Alt-4. It is bound in the file to run-selected-unit-tests-locally.

**Important**: Some unit tests may fail on your environment.  Don't worry about them.  You need only ensure that your new code causes no *other* unit tests to fail.  If in doubt, ask on [leo-editor](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leo-editor).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180523101514.6">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/836

Here are the basics:

**g.trace**

g.trace(*args, **kwargs) prints its arguments to the console.

**g.pdb**

g.pdb() invokes a version of [python's pdb debugger](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html), adapted to Leo's Qt gui.  I use g.pdb only rarely, when g.trace doesn't tell me enough.

**Using `@`button/command nodes as a testing framework**

This is the so-called [stupendous Aha](http://leoeditor.com/FAQ.html#what-is-the-stupendous-aha-and-why-does-it-matter). This can save you a lot of time.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180523101514.7">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/818

For any programming project I recommend using github issues to track your work.  You'll be glad you did.

This is especially true for Leo devs.  You want other people to be able to follow and comment on your work.

The convention is to have the first comment for any issue contain an up-to-date summary of the status of the issue.  I have found that it is useful to continually edit the first comment.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180523101514.8">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/817

Many of Leo's most important devs made major contributions to Leo without asking me a single question.  Do they have super powers?  No, they don't.

But they do know the secret of programming: **Simple processes, endlessly repeated, suffice to find, understand and change *any* software**.  And Leo simplifies these techniques even further.  Here they are...

**Basic skill/process 1: Familiarize yourself with the code**

For any project you want to know what files exist.  When studying other people's code I use a [recursive import script](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/846) to create a tree of files. The goal is just to have a *vague* understanding of what files are involved. Don't even think about remember details.

It's even easier with Leo.  LeoPy.py contains Leo's sources.  Peruse this outline, seeing what `@file` nodes it contains.

*Don't make a big deal about this step*. It should just take 5 or 10 minutes. Look *only* at files that interest you. In those files you will probably want to look briefly at the top-level classes in the files that interest you. You will likely repeat this step many times, adding a little to your understanding each time.

**Basic skill/process 2: Learn what to search for**

We devs often want to change how commands work.  You can usually find the top-level code for a command simply by searching for the command's name, in single quotes.

To find the definition of a method, function or class, simply control-click on it.  That will start a search for def x and class x.  If that doesn't work, a cff (clone-find-all-flattened) search on a name will find all uses of that name in the present outline.

**Basic skill/process 3: Look for helpers in child nodes**

With Leo outlines **it's natural to put a method's helpers in child nodes**. I usually forget implementation details, but the children of a node usually contain most of the details.

**Basic skill/process 4: Use clones to organize and remember your work**

When working on a project I make create an organizer node as the last top-level node of the outline.  This node will typically contain a link to the github issue.  I make clones of all relevant nodes and move them so they are clones of the organizer node.  For complex projects I may create subsidiary organizer nodes, like "changed", "reference", etc.

When a project is done (or suspended), I move the project's organizer node so it is the last child of *another* organizer node called "Recent Code". This hides all work except the what I am, this minute, working on.  This is important: it hides details and lessens distractions.

**Summary**

The easy processes just described form the basis for programming workflow.

*Expect to repeat these processes many times*.  Don't worry if not everything is clear at first.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180523101514.9">https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/786

I recommend using the organization of leo/themes/EKRDark.leo as a guide. **Note**: Syntax coloring settings are required because they are *not* used in the css.

To avoid confusion, it's best if theme .leo files contain no **unbound settings**. This will ensure that the appearance of a theme does not unwittingly depend on settings in myLeoSettings.leo.

**Important**: Theme devs should set the following **theme description settings**:

    @string theme_name   # crucial
    @bool color_theme_is_dark
    @string color_theme = ekr_dark

These settings ensure that relative urls (including ":/" syntax are resolved properly in css, and that icons are found in the proper directories.

**Icons boxes should have constant width**.  Otherwise, the variable indentation of the rest of the headline appears to represent variable outline structure, which is highly confusing.

**Obsolete**: The post [ENB: Simple design principles for style sheets](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/JyyuOscgmow/kAJcGU0xBQAJ) contained my original ideas.  In particular, the so-called "settings Aha" is dubious.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180523101625.1"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20180524104432.1">The recursive import script now adds disambiguating headline comments as follows:

- If a node is a descendant of a class node, the script prepends the class's name:

    aClass.headline

- Otherwise, the script appends the file name:

    headline (x.py)

This is a huge help when using the clone-find commands.

<t tx="ekr.20180608054151.1">This branch incorporates Vitalije's great new read code.  This code reads external files (from @file nodes) almost exactly as fast as when using the cacher.

As a result, file caching is no longer needed, The --no-cache option is gone.

** Highlights of the fast-read branch **

1. It includes the no-sax branch.  That is, the fast-read branch contains new code for reading both external files and .leo files.

2. Caching has been radically simplified:

A. No file caching whatever is done.  The cache contains only non-essential items, such as marked and expanded bits.

B. ~/.leo/db now contains only two sub-folders: g_app_db and global_data.  g_app_db corresponds to the old "global" folder.  It contains the cached result of g.app.db.  The global_data folder contains all expanded and marked bits, plus some other data.  The keys are simply the full path names of each .leo file.  This should be safe enough.

3. Leo writes only a vestigial &lt;globals&gt; element in .leo files.  This should be enough to allow old (Leo 4.5 and above) versions of Leo to read .leo files.

4. Leo no longer writes expanded and marked bits to the root node of @file trees.

5. As a result of 2, 3 and 4, all Leo files are essentially "fixed".  Their contents will change much less often than before.  As a result, the c.fixed switch has been eliminated, along with the @bool fixedwindow setting.

6. The g.enableDB switch has been eliminated. The --no-cache command-line argument has been deprecated.

**Summary**

Leo now works as if --no-cache were permanently in effect.  In other words, Leo always recreates outlines directly from external files.  This eliminates an important source of confusion.

Leo's new read code is almost exactly as fast as reading cached data, a remarkable accomplishment.

Leo no longer pollutes .leo files with non-essential data, resulting in fewer diffs of .leo files.

<t tx="ekr.20180608054356.1">This branch greatly reduces overhead during startup.

1. All generators yielding positions now accept a "copy" kwarg.

   The default value is True, for compatibility with user scripts.
   
   When True, these generators yield *copies* of all positions.

   Leo's core sets copy=False in several places, greatly reducing
   unnecessary positions.

2. g.isUnicode and g.toUnicode are simpler and faster.

3. Rewrote g.is_special, greatly reduced calls to g.match_words.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180608055318.1">@language rest

This command just calls g.printStats, which prints the contents of g.app.statsDict.

Put the following snippet at the start of any function/method you wish to profile:

@language python

    if not g.app.statsLockout:
        g.app.statsLockout = True
        try:
            d = g.app.statsDict
            key = 'g.isUnicode:' + g.callers()
            d [key] = d.get(key, 0) + 1
        finally:
            g.app.statsLockout = False
            
@language rest

To see the stats, restart Leo, then do print-stats.

This pattern produces superb statistics that show how many times the *callers* of a routine called the routine.  Here are before/after statistics for g.match_word:

@language python

# Yikes: createAllButtons takes a long time.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180827104847.1">Leo's @pyplot nodes support
`matplotlib &lt;https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html&gt;`_.
\@pyplot nodes start with @pyplot in the headline.  The rest of the headline is comments. These nodes should contain matplotlib scripts that create figures or animations.  Like this::

    fig2 = plt.figure()
    x = np.arange(-9, 10)
    y = np.arange(-9, 10).reshape(-1, 1)
    base = np.hypot(x, y)
    images = []
    for add in np.arange(15):
        images.append((
            plt.pcolor(x, y, base+add, norm=plt.Normalize(0, 30)),
        ))
    animation = animation.ArtistAnimation(fig2, images,
        interval=50, repeat_delay=3000, blit=True)
    g.app.permanentScriptDict['animations'] = animation
        # Keep a python reference to the animation, so it will complete.

**Notes**

1. If the viewrendered (VR) pane is open, Leo will display the animation in the VR pane whenever the user selects the @pyplot node.  This has been tested only with the viewrendered.py, not the viewrendered2.py plugin.

2. In addition to c, g, and p, the VR code predefines several other vars.  The VR code does the following imports::

    import matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.animation as animation

and then predefines the animation, matplotlib, np, numpy and plt vars in the @pyplot script. numpy is also predefined as an alias for np.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20180827105047.1">To display images and animations in an external window, *don't* put the script in an @pyplot node. Instead, put the script in a regular node, with the following modifications:

1. Add the required imports::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.animation as animation

2. Place the following at the end of the script::

    plt.ion()
        # sets interactive mode. Prevents this message:
        # QCoreApplication::exec: The event loop is already running
    plt.show()
    
**Bugs**

1. Once you use the VR pane to display an image, you can't (at present) display an image externally.

2. The VR plugin will refuse to close the VR pane if it ever displays an @pyplot image or animation. This prevents Leo from hard crashing in the pyplot code. As a workaround, you can  resize the VR pane so it is effectively hidden.</t>

When installing Leo from GitHub with
``pip install https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel.zip``
numerous files are left out.

**Solution**

Installing from Github into a new environment must be done in discrete
steps: download, unpack, and install in editable mode.

Example::

   wget https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel.zip
   7z x devel.zip -o C:\apps
   pip install --editable C:\apps\leo-editor-devel

On Windows there are powershell versions of wget if needed.

For easier upgrading substitute ``git clone`` for ``wget`` &amp; ``7z``
steps::

   git clone --single-branch -b devel --depth=100 https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor.git
   pip install --editable leo-editor

Time passes, upgrade desired::

   pushd c:\apps\leo-editor
   git pull

``single-branch``, ``b`` and ``depth`` are all optional, but will
dramatically speed up download time as it only grabs the latest
development branch and skips all but the last couple weeks or months of
history.</t>

- Document the plugin thoroughly in the plugin's docstring. This allows the documentation to be accessed from the Plugins menu.
  
- Document any new commands with a proper docstring. This allows the minibuffer command `help-for-command` to provide help for the command.
  
- In `leo/doc/sphinx-docs/sphinxDocs.leo`, to the node `@file leo.plugins.rst`, add the following snippet (preferably in alphabetical order), with the name of the plugin modified to the name of your plugin (here `ipython`). This allows the API docs to be automatically updated::

<t tx="shadow.20080825171547.9">**Question**: I must follow a coding standard when writing source code. It includes a maximum line length restriction. How can I know the length of a line when it gets written to the external file?

**Answer**: If a node belongs to a external file hierarchy, its body might get indented when it is written to the external file. It happens when an @others directive or a section name appears indented in a higher-level node body. While (**line**, **col**) in status area show the line and column containing the body text's cursor, **fcol** shows the cursor coordinate relative to the external file, not to the current node. The relation **fcol &gt;= col** is always true.

  leo-editor-50c070b715b9fec50c31be5853055a0ebc72cad5.zip

where the ``50c0...cad5`` part is the ID or fingerprint of the version you've downloaded.  Except "Latest", which is just ``leo-editor-master.zip``.

Here are direct download links for the "devel" branch, which changes frequently and contains all recent bug fixes:

  - `Latest devel &lt;https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel.zip&gt;`_
  - `devel: 1 day ago &lt;https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/archive/devel@{1%20day%20ago}.zip&gt;`_

<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.1">Leo's ``--ipython`` command-line option enables two-way communication (**ILeo**, the **IPython bridge**) between Leo and IPython: you can run Leo scripts from IPython, and IPython scripts from Leo.

The level of integration is much deeper than conventional integration in IDEs. Most notably, you are able to store and manipulate *data* in Leo nodes, in addition to mere program code--essentially making ILeo a hierarchical spreadsheet, albeit with non-grid view of the data. The possibilities of this are endless, and the approach can be applied in wide range of problem domains with very little actual coding.

<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.2">.. _`run Leo in a console window`: installing.html#running-leo-from-a-console-window

To run Leo's IPython bridge:

1. Install IPython 4.0 and above and Jupyter.

2. `run Leo in a console window`_ with the ``--ipython`` command-line option enabled. This option starts an instance of the IPython shell in the console. Leo and IPython run simultaneously and independently. Their separate event loops do not interfere with each other. The ipython-new command launches new terminals connected to the same IPython kernel.
