I do not think the 'use lossage()' key functions should be in the core, unless you know better...

A few things:

- depending on the actual size of the Body pane, there can be a small amount of 'micro-scrolling' as you move the cursor to the top/bottom of the pane. I think my other editor resizes the pane so as not to have partial text lines. The current behaviour seems liveable with, although I might be interested in learning how to 'fix' this.

- I don't currently deal with any existing selected region. If this were to go into the core this would probably all be refactored, maybe using some of the existing helper functions

- the doKey() function has to know about the key(s) that are calling it, "Home" or "End" in the lossage() list. How might I improve this?

- I had some trouble calling the pre-existing editor commands, like c.editCommand.beginningOfBuffer() etc. Not 100% sure I am doing this correctly.

- as per the comments I am currently assuming that lossage() has at least three entries. I'll fix this shortly.
       
Anyway, here's what I have. I am currently using two @command nodes

Not a huge thing, but it makes the rendering compatible in spirit of (the hidden relationships in) the body pane.

Quick additions to Leo's core:

A better attribute gui would help *everyone*.
- We need to be *associate icons with attributes*.
- This can be used for chapters, bookmarks, my-view-a/b/c, etc.

An **attribute calculus** would form union & intersections of attributes.

We would like searches to add/clear attributes. The Nav or nodetags plugins could do this. We might also want interactive add/remove attribute commands. These plugins could also hoist the nodes they show, similar to create-chapter-from-nodes command.

clone-mark-all could also set define attribues.

A more ambitious addition: Define a gui interface for uA's.

Being able to make uA's visible somehow would give Leo many of the cool features of the ECCO outliner. We envisage a uA tab in the outline pane that would allow the user to:

- See all and only nodes with given attributes.  This is similar to Leo's clone-find-all (or clone-find-all-flattened) commands, combined with something like a hoist.

- List all such nodes in the uA pane, similar to the Nav Pane (Quicksearch plugin), so that clicking on a node would select the node in the entire outline, with only ancestors of the selected node expanded.  Pretty easy to do.  Alternatively, perhaps some  tag (uA) oriented features can be added to existing plugins.

From: Kent Tenney <ktenney@gmail.com>

The editor envy resulting from the Light Table demo has me revisiting a feature that's been percolating.

Sending output to the log pane is very useful, it's how Leo talks back.

Executing from the command line means one space for input and output.

Executing in a Leo node and writing to the log improves on this by providing different spaces for input and output.

Could Leo generalize this concept such that any node could be designated as a destination for output?

Given multiple visible nodes, akin to Terry's stickynotes, or Ville's recent grid suggestion, Leo could duplicate the power of simultaneous feedback shown by Light Table.

I guess 'rendering' addresses this to some degree.

Reminds me of the power graph database folks talk about, where you can define nodes and edges to be whatever you want.

The nodes could be sources or sinks. Sources: code or commands ... Sinks: standard out, tail -f logfile, network traffic, introspection ...

The edges would define handlers for the content of the sources, format the results and send to the sinks.

So, as I write code in one node, I can see a node displaying stdout, another watching a log file, another showing docstrings, another showing test results ...

===== Ville

The 'ileo workbook' concept is relevant; it allowed you to easily reference other nodes in your scripts (wb.foo meant node with headline 'foo').

It's nice in theory, but the rigid ui model where we show only one node at a time made it hard to visualize. Tabula or grid would make it more concrete and intuitive - you could show input, output and the manipulator script at the same time. Or make small nodes with intermedote results etc.

How this would relate to 'pipeline' - you would have explicit way to say what nodes are input, whan nodes are output and what are the scripts that transform input to output. Editing inputs or scriyts would ping you somehow that outputs are out of date, allowing you to easily press button to recalculate outputs.

Yes, provided somebody understands what the simultaneous feedback is ;-)

Tabula might be natural for that, perhaps enhanced via free_layout.

Interesting connection.  We might want to render to tabula nodes.

This is coming.  Redefining edges would be easy provided that they had
different colors from the "main" edges.

Yes.  This is a straightforward generalization of your first question.

A new idea!  This could be revolutionary!

To paraphrase: nodes and links are not simply ways to represent structure.  They may have independent identity and function.  A brilliant idea.

In fact, the inadequacy of my remark that assigning to v.b was all that was needed lead me to consider the broadcaster/listener framework.

The idea is that the v.b setter property would broadcast the fact that v.b has changed to all the listeners connected to v.  Presumably, those listeners will be UI elements that will update their text from v.b and recolor as appropriate.

We might generalize this concept to update outline structure in those UI elements that show outlines.

> My impression of the Light Table demo is that the right side of the screen was reporting interesting information about what was being typed on the left side. Seems like it could be called "simultaneous feedback"

An excellent generalization.  We can use this without knowing exactly what the feedback is, or where it comes from.

Keeping up with ourselves these days seems like a full-time job.

I believe a broadcaster/listener event framework is an essential ingredient.  It shouldn't be too hard to do, it will simplify existing code, and it will be an enabling technology that will stimulate further development.

​https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/YjJdWjNSM9o/SDL7Nb__OUcJ

There is a way to allow clones *anywhere* in @file nodes and simplify Leo's read code in the process!

The idea is for the read code to treat *all* nodes exactly the same initially, regardless of whether they should actually be clones of each other. A post-pass would then "unify" all vnodes having the same gnx.

Why, oh, why, did I never think of doing this? It will be *so* much simpler than the present code!​ And it will be just as fast, maybe even faster. Another example of generality arising from simplicity...

I can tell you why I *did* think of doing this now: the new @auto read logic uses a new p._relinkAsCloneOf method, exactly what the @file read post pass will use!

.. @+node:ekr.20100209160132.5770: *5* cache notes
Top-level folder are direct subfolders of .leo/db.

Top-level folders represent file *locations* not file contents.

Exception: the top-level "globals" folder represents minor data.

Only two files are ever needed in a top-level folder:

contents_<key>: the contents of the file.
data_<key>: a dict representing the "minor data" of the file:
    <globals> element stuff, expansion bits, etc.

We write contents_<key> only once.
By definition, its contents never changes, since the contents generates the key.
We can write data_<key> as many times as we like.

To do:
- Simplify or even eliminate the path-manipulation code in PickleShareDB.
- Use g.makeAllNonExistentDirectories to make top-level directories.
- Clear cache should clear all top-level directories.

1. Memory does leak, and that's not ok with me.  And I want just two files per top-level directory.

2. Strange things can happen with caching, as just happened to me when I restored qtui_generate.py mistakenly deleted from leo/test.  There is an @auto node for this file in qtGui.py, and I got improper 'can not open' messages for this file.

3. It is troubling that the present caching scheme does not use the full path to a file, only the basename.  This means that two identical files in two different places will use the same cache entries.  I've been wondering for the last several days about whether this could cause problems.  I don't know for sure, but I am uncomfortable.

4. I want the clear-cache and clear-all-caches commands to do what they say: get rid of everything.  Among other things, this is good for debugging and recovering from cache problems.
.. @+node:ekr.20100210163813.5748: *5* Caching buglets?
This is a recent bug, but imo it has uncovered some other caching buglets. These buglets are not big enough to delay Leo 4.7, but the new caching scheme would ensure they never bite.

1. The code that computes what I have been calling the top-level directory is dubious::

    dbdirname = join(g.app.homeLeoDir,'db',
            '%s_%s' % (bname,hashlib.md5(fn).hexdigest()))

The problem is that bname is only the base name of the cached file, not a name (or key) that depends on the full path. Thus, two copies of the same file in the same place will be cached in the same directory. Is this ominous?

2. It's not clear what caching to do with the save-to command.

with py2.3 after allot of small edits on an open leo after a few hours gc can
hit unexpectedly and last several minutes
and return at any time lasting several more minutes.
I think its gc related because the memory use and disk grinding demanding I
free up memory or kill python.

I have no idea if undo is the cause,
 just guessing.
using cvs of last week. I just updated, 
will let you know if it happens again.
(new error reporting jump to error is great)

usually I don't edit in the same process that long.
I have run scripts from leo that run 6, 12 
or 24 hours no problem. 
maybe I can turn on some internals reporting and
get some feedback on whats going on from python if it happens again. 
or run the gc script before and after.

 win98 128meg w/maxmem memory defrager that works well.
but I go from 50% free to 10% when this starts happening.
I haven't noticed this problem yet in py2.4, and it is peppier,
but don't use py2.4 enough. it doesn't happen every day.
I reboot at least once a day for various reasons.
so it isn't that either. 
you do need to reboot and or exit python once it starts.
this was never an issue with py2.2 and Leo 4.1 or less with only 64 megs.
I don't really have any other long running python processes to compare to Leo. 
can't say what it is.
Aha, progress. 
this started sometime early in 4.2 or late 4.1
but I can still be persuaded something in my 
local system is to blame, some install or dll update. or script, psyco or plugin
related.

nonwithstanding, I should be taking better advantage Moore's law in my CPU and
memory.
I only notice this when I'm running the same leo over a few hours of constant
editing and running scrips.
and when I exit python and restart leo everything returns to normal.

A big Leo fan pointed me at Leo, and this group - indicated that sharing Leo documents has been talked about over the years, but not really implemented, and suggested that I post some details about a project that I've been working on.  So....

Basic model is synchronized copies of documents, linked by an asynchronous pub-sub channel.  Think of a personal Wiki (like TiddlyWiki) - linked to copies of itself, that's the general idea.  Compose a document, email copies to collaborators, everyone saves a local copy - those copies link to each other via a pub-sub protocol to distribute updates.  All in JavaScript, embedded in the "smart documents" - nothing special to install.

In the multifile plugin there is an option to insert a directory string.  I use it alot for the @path directive.

The good of this:

It makes using path simpler, you dont have to type out the directory path yourself, just use the tkFileDialog to select it and have Leo insert the string. For long directories this saves a lot of typing.

As I start to think about how to print Leo, I become more aware of the differneces between Leo structures and linear [print] layouts.

Different kinds of outlines obviously will need different kinds of printing. I don't yet have enough experience or overview.

**xslt**

Seems a natural way to go for printing Leo, but yet another langauge and syntax to wrassle with. Last time I looked I went from being horrified to very impressed to be being exhausted.

**swf [flash]**

This printing topic pushes me harder to get FLC  [my FlashLeoClient project] into the Leosphere.

Flash has *limited*  CSS handling, but enough to do some nice and useful typographic formatting in a pretty clean object-oriented manner.

FLC parses .leo files into a Flash object. Flash Textformat instances are created using CSS and can be applied then to rendering any parts of  the deserialized Leo object.. The beauty is it can be very fast and ynamic so I can imagine a real-time WYSIWYG laytou tool for printing Leo to web and at the same making it suitable at the same time for print-to-paper.

Since FLC is in the very first instance a READ-ONLY client tool for Leo, it makes it a natural Leo printing service.

To complete full service, it woudl be good if Leo could create SWF files directly itself, just like using PDF reportwriter. There are a couple of libraries to help this
- Ming [with PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby wrappers] http://ming.sourceforge.net/

- makeswf.r [interesting REBOL/Flash dialect by David Oldes]
http://sweb.cz/oliva.david/swf/

These could also be both configured as web-services. So Leo print-to-web would include by default rendering a flash swf file versoin of itself either using locally installed libraries or by passing a view of itself to a chosen client or server-based tool.

But even without those extra 'services' and libraries a single flash file in the form of FLC could become an effective Leo printing kit. Using a standalone desktop  version [not embedded in the browser, out of the sandbox] much more is possible - remote control, peer-peer editing, file writing etc.

**flashpaper2**

btw, Lately I've been using Flashpaper2 a lot to print all kinds of stuff, Often from web pages to my local adhoc home filebase. It's a very fast lighweight alternative to PDF, saves paper, has excellent zooming and nice search features built-in. Flashpaper renders a very litteral snapshot, but as I am discovering that turns out to be extremely useful. For example you visit a page and click on some links. Flashpaper saves teh pages exactly as it looks, viisted links disntinguished.  In the era of info-overload, even that crude mnemonic is valuable.

Alas, Flashpaper2 is not free nor open in the way Leo is. But worth to play with it if only for for the experience. 30 day trial downlaod from http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashpaper/

And of course the flash _players_ is free, so can send people flashpaper documents just like PDF. Brilliant when you have a big Excel spreadsheet or CAD document which would normally get all messy printing across pages, confusing people. Instead adjust and print to a generous 'piece' of flashpaper - letting your coleagues pan and zoom to their comfort.

I've not quite figured out the place where  Leo meets Flashpaper, because Leo needs to preserve its full pane contents. Flashpaper works fine with long web pages, automatically reading the full window contents and cutting into a paginated sequence, ready for paper printing. Leo's does not have aprint menu, so it's off the sytem's print-devices map, which Flash paper appearing just  like any phtycial printer.

I imagine is possible to fix that in Leo, but I do not where to begin and woudl not be surprised to learn its a major heachche to write adn debug for multiple operating systems.

An immediate alternative are screencapture tools like vnc2swf or MDM Capture.

[vnc2swf uses Ming-0.2a]
http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/

http://www.multidmedia.com/software/capture/index.php

But much is hidden or lost from view. 
Still very vauable for creating dynamic narrative tutorials [aka screencasting]

AS you know I am very excited about what flash can do for Leo, and vice versa.
But I am concerned that there is not yet a 100% Leo means which supports people's
standard print needs and habits.

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3593116
By: ktenney

Zope3, with it's component based architecture, has machinery which hooks components together .. Interfaces, Adapters and ZCML, the configuration language.

It sounds like the autocompleter code is able to build indexes of classes and methods. It would be cool if that capability could be extensible, allowing building indexes of the couplings between components.

I think this might look like some kind of automatic hyperlinking, providing access to related code, as defined for that application.

I really don't know if this makes sense, but I see you moving in the direction of making Leo capable of doing some _explaining_ of the code being written.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/d302b2715b3ace96

A reminder, the opposite of "light" is "heavy", not "dark" :-)

Leo's print-settings, print-commands and print-bindings commands
create too much text.

Suppose they created outline nodes instead, replacing existing nodes
if they exist.  Something like this:

- Reference (Anywhere you like)
 - @print-settings
    etc.
 - @print-bindings
   etc
 - @print commands
   etc

Doh!  This uses Leo's power.  The subnodes can be as voluminous as desired, and there can be organizer nodes in each case.  The actual tree could be specified as in @menus.

Etc., etc.  This could moot the need for separate apropos commands. Conversely, apropos commands could create their own trees, or subtrees.

This could be the tip of an iceberg.

The more I think about the light/heavy distinction, the more I think it is getting close to what makes Leo special.  For example, clones (and nodes, for that matter) drastically lighten the apparent complexity of programs or data.

https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2003457
By: dsalomoni

Proposal: modify the code for @url so that if you type for example just "@url" (no file specified) in a headline, a window pops up allowing you to browse the local file system and select the file (similar to what browsers do when you want to open a file).

This would be more convenient than manually writing @url file://a/long/path/to/the/file. @read-only nodes already allow this, it would perhaps be nice if all these types of plugins (@folder might be another one for example) and directives (@file etc) had the same behavior (and this should probably be specified in some guidelines for writing new plugins -see e.g. the jedit plugin guidelines).

tab-cycle-next makes the following not so important

There is a relationship here with mouseless programming.  It would seem that all visual elements, especially those that may exist in multiple versions, must have a name or other description suitable for generalized commands.

The user might want multiple rendering panes, especially if one or more are locked.  Without a description, there is no way to specify exactly what show/hide-rendering pane does.

I haven't forgotten the autocompleter docs.  I'll get to them next. It looks like autocompletion would be the way to generalize the not- very-effect commands that switch focus from one ui element to another.  A related benefit is one generalized command might be more convenient to use than the present flavors of (buggy) cycle-focus commands.

In short, contemplating generalized windows leads us to generalized select/delete/show/hide commands, based on autocompletion, that work on various ui elements.

This is highly off-topic for most on the list, so feel free to ignore, but anyone using Leo for single-source documentation generation/conversion, including future googlers, please reply with comments or notes on your experiences.

I have been advocating the idea of pushing Leo-derived content to DokuWiki as a platform for "wiki-publishing" to enable collaborative/community editing of content (1 <../d/msg/leo-editor/fSzVi1Rh5Tg/uu85satgb9YJ>, 2<../d/msg/leo-editor/xf6_HBxlV_c/4RgGYdDh8ywJ>).

However, I have recently learned of the wiki platform Gitit <https://github.com/jgm/gitit#readme>, which apparently, like DW, also uses plain-text files rather than a database back-end, and integrates not only with git but mercurial (and darcs).

The only downsides are that Gitit is a Haskell project rather than Python, and one thing I like about Txt2tags is its support for conversion to AsciiDoc, rather than Pandoc's direct output to full-blown DocBook XML - but apparently even that's in the works in Pandoc's dev version.

Anyone in the Leo community using Gitit, especially for use beyond simple code documentation?

Now that I'm using Leo + Fossil for my documentation related matters=20
and distributed work I certainly think that a distributed off-line=20
collaboration system for documentation is needed and, if MoinMoin can't=20
support the use of distributed wikis (and seems is not planned or in=20
development [1][2]) Gitit would be a nice place to start with this idea=20
and would offer advantages over the non-distributed and outdated Zope's=20

an implementation of Gitit. On a related matter one of the problems I=20

because it deals elegantly with a problem in the diversity of markup=20

You're right and I like the idea of "everything is a something" when=20
that something is powerful unifying idea. That's the case with Unix's=20
"everything is a file" or Smalltalk's "everything is an object" (in=20
Unix you have also every tool makes one thing and makes it right,=20
combined with pipes). For me these two paradigm's were the ones that,=20
in 70's, were fighting for the mind share  about computer experience of=20
today and both of them won in a dystopic way, but for me "taking genius=20
to understand Unix simplicity"[0], was even more dystopic. When you're=20
trying to empower users the impedance between development and=20
deployment shows the dystopia, at least compared with the original=20
visions, so most of the "end users" cant change the tool that changes=20
them, so, someone else is making decisions about that changes and that=20
users.

[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Quotes

I like the simplicity of light markups and I try myself of not using=20
explicitly nothing as xml and I like also the idea of the light markup=20
being used by VCS tools. That's not where dystopia lies. The problem is=20
not about files or structure but about "meta-structure" (structure=20
talking about structure, as in meta-languages), specially=20
self-referential meta-structure, because self-referential=20
meta-structures are the key for self-directed change, as opposed with=20
change directed by others. When you see how the "world of everything is=20
a file" talks about itself, there is a lot of impedance and=20
discontinuity between source code, binary, apps and docs and there is a=20
long path for the user who is confined to using apps to create docs,=20
but never change the apps that could let she/he to change his/her=20
writing and that's why I want to use Leo this semester with=20
non-technical writers to explore the way that writing change the tool=20
that writes and not only the human who does.

For me a unified emergent meta-structure in the world of "everything is=20
a file" is where lies the power of Leo. You can use an outline to=20
change the way that Leo behaves and that's why having the Leo's=20
self-referential meta-structure is more powerful that the "dystopic=20
world of everything is a file" (in that world you don't have=20
meta-structure, only structure, mostly for storage purposes and the=20
intelligence to read/process it is mostly outside the file, in the=20
human reader, the compiler or the binary). What Leo does is to create=20
self-referentiality in the world of everything is a file by introducing=20
outlines that can talk/structure the files and that can talk about=20
outlines, i.e outlines that can talk about files and about themselves=20
and can reprogram the way Leo itself works, and so Leo is bridging the=20
gap between objects and files in a valuable and unique way.  But we=20
need still to improve, specifically we need a more elegant way to talk=20
about that files, specially about their changes in time, because is in=20

I'm agree with you. Server and gigantism have not to be equal, but=20
unfortunately in the "dystopic informatic world" (where the previous=20

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3578252
By: bwmulder

I have been thinking for a while that it ought to be possible to somehow  to unite Leo with wiki features (my thinking is still vague at this point).

If you look at systems like Tiddlywiki (http://www.tiddlywiki.com/) you will find that they already pretty much provide all the formatting features mentioned in the article.

MoinMoin, another wiki (http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de), has started to use a graphical interface for editing in the latest version.

Maybe Leo can be split up into three components:

1. A storage component is responsible for storing nodes. Currently, this is just memory, but databases like shelve, Zope or sqllite should also be possible.

2. The control component is responsible for converting from the internal format to external files which can be processed by existing compilers, searching within a document, and the like.

3. A display component is responsible for interfacing with the user. If can be TK, but it can also be something like the Tiddlywiki interface, which immediately shows the formatting applied to text.

I don't know much about javascript, so I would have to learn more about this language before doing anything in this direction.

As an intermediate step, maybe we could allow mixing RST processing with regular program text.  Leo would produce two documents out of a source file: a version for the compiler in plain ascii, and an HTML file for reading the source.

One feature I have not seen in SCS system is something which might be called "history compression": I might be interested in having both version 5 and 6 in my source tree, when the current version is 7, but I am not really interested in the 2000 steps which transformed 5 into 6 (just suggested this feature to the bazaar people). This happens actually quite often to me, since I use the SCS as a back-up system, saving many (uninteresting) intermediate steps while implementing a new feature.

I don't think this feature is worth doing.

It is astoundingly easy to create this multi-dag in Leo.

Each vnode has a parents list and a children list.  All we have to do is replace these two lists by dictionaries whose keys are attributes and whose values are the parents or children lists for those attributes.  Finally, we add Python properties shield the dictionary lookup from the rest of Leo.  We are talking about maybe 50 lines of code!

As far as the rest of Leo is concerned, vnodes still have parents and children lists.  The switcheroo happens totally invisibly, when the user wants to see another view.  The attribute changes and that changes what the vnode dictionary/properties "deliver" to the rest of Leo.

I have been using txt2tags + Nested Editor to produce structured docs in

Now I think that is time to start hacking Leo for a better support of my 
work flow and the first thing I would like to have is a "@paragraph" 
directive that works the same as @rst-no-head but can be used in any 
part of a (sub)tree, even if is not @rst (sub)tree. This would come 
handy in chunking and reassembling LaTeX docs without marking up the

From: Todd Mars <tamnt54@gmail.com>

I remember reading -somewhere- about comparing various multi-parent or multi-copy of node outline types (clones vs. backlinks or whatever) but I can't find where I read that. Where is it? Desire to read analysis, isn't that in the leo docs somewhere?

Terry

Personally I think Leo could navigate cyclic graphs, see http://leo.zwiki.org/GraphsInTrees particularly the 'Older notes' section towards the end. But it's a major issue with regard to all the algorithms which don't expect to run in to loops. And the extra layer of connections from the backlinks plugin allows the same functionality, so it may be that it's more an interface issue than a data model issue.

I'd like Leo to be able to behave like CmapTools, http://cmap.ihmc.us/ but maybe it can, essentially, and it's really a matter of defining some new interface bells and whistles.

.. @+node:ekr.20160503093454.2: *4* Ignore URL's in scripts?
@language rest
@wrap

From: HaveF <iamaplayer@gmail.com>

I write a script (say, @button button-1) in leo-file-A.leo, and reuse it by copy(ctrl+shift+c) the button to leo-file-B.leo.

When I'm working on leo-file-B.leo, I may have ideas to improve the @button button-1, but at that time(working on leo-file-B.leo), I may forget where the original place of @button button-1 is. Even I store the original scripts in the default workbook.leo is a tedious work to deal with(open it, locate where the original script is, update it...)

After I add the @url at the first line of @button button-1, I can decide if the improvements what I made on leo-file-B.leo's @button button-1 should or shouldn't be merged to the original and upstream @button button-1(in leo-file-A.leo) easily by just a click.

And if I work on leo-file-C.leo, I want to use the same script, but I just only remember I use the script in the leo-file-B.leo instead of original place. With @url I can easily jump to original place, and copy it to leo-file-C.leo.

Using @url in the leo script, I can make the scripts consistency and
diversity at same time.

===== Feature request

At present, you can use this idea by comment the @url line after jump. If @url isn't comment, the leo-editor will say... SyntaxError: invalid syntax at the @url line.

Maybe it is a good idea to omit the @url line in the script when executing script?

===== EKR

Yes.  I think this is a good idea.  A similar idea occurred to me when looking at @rclick nodes.  

At present, the context_menu plugin contains an ugly hack:  it allows an @rclick node to *follow* an @button node.  This is needed at present when the @button node contains @others: the @rclick node can't be part of the script "pulled in" by @others.

It would be much more elegant to ignore @rclick nodes when computing the script.  This would require a change to the @others logic, but I think it is worthwhile.

===== Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

I do this kind of thing by keeping buttons in @files...

@file ~/.leo/gen  # general utility buttons
@file ~/.leo/dml  # tools for editing an XML dialect I use
@file ~/.leo/sql  # tools for editing SQL / interacting with server

so changes made in one outline are automatically propagated to other
outlines next time they're reloaded.  You just reference the files
in each outline where you want those buttons.

Thanks for all these comments.  I'll respond to them all here.

Clearly, we should be using a standard xml parser to read .leo files.

My present thoughts:

- I personally like human-readable headlines in <v> elements.

- I am open to putting headlines in <t> elements, as an indication that
tnodes do indeed contain headlines and body text.

- I am willing to consider only writing shared subtrees once.

Oh! (An Aha)  All these are preferences.  We can allow any combination of
these provided that headlines appear somewhere.

So that's clean.  This will happen in Leo 4.5. 
.. @+node:ekr.20110421132230.6107: *5* File format, v3 draft 4
Leo's file format: version 3, draft 4

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/a2b7e5321d62b64/a4cc51d404af94aa

Here is the latest version, with the graphml stuff removed.

This draft is intended to reflect our recent discussions, with no new invention from me. All comments and corrections welcome.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted for use as a json file format.

Recent changes
==============

- Removed graphml stuff, including leo: prefixes.

- Used "key" in <attr> elements (and "type" in <edge> elements.)

First lines
===========

Leo file will start with the following::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo: http://leoeditor.com/leo_toc.html -->
    <leo_file file_format="3"
        xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
        

No session data
===============

There will be no <globals>, <preferences> or <find_panel_settings> elements. All such "session data" will be restored from the cache, or from defaults if caching is disabled.

**Important**: there is no representation of expansion state or the currently selected node anywhere in the .leo file. Eliminating these data is contingent on having Leo work well with caching disabled.

Note: marks are more than session data. They must appear somewhere within <node> elements.


Summary of format
=================

.leo files will have the following form, with similar indentation::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo: http://leoeditor.com/leo_toc.html -->
    <leo_file file_format="3" xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
    <graph>
    <nodes>
        <!-- marked attribute appears only if the vnode is marked -->
        <node id="gnx"> 
            <head>headline text</head>
            <attr key="marked">1</attr>
            <!-- uA's... -->
            <!-- format="string" is the default -->
            <attr key="a">a string</attr>
            <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
            <attr key="c" format="pickle">a pickled string</attr>
            <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
            ...
            <body>body text</body>
        </node>
        ...
        <!-- @file nodes contain a <data> package -->
        <node id="gnx">
            <head>@file x.py</head>
            ...
            <at-file-attributes>
                <attr>key="ua-name"
                    format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"
                    gnx="gnx">value
                </attr>
                ...
            </at-file-attributes>
        </node>
        ...
    </nodes>
    <edges>
        <edge type="child" from="gnx" to="gnx"</edge>
        ...
    </edges>
    </graph>
    </leo_file>

<attr> elements
===============

<attr> elements will one of the following forms::

    <attr key="a">a unicode string</attr>
    <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="c" format="pickle">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
    
That is, the value will be a string by default.

uA's that start with "binhex_" will use the binhex format. This prefix must be retained in the type field, so the read code can restore them.

If the value is not a string, and there is no "binhex_" prefix, the write code will use format="json" if json.dumps succeeds, and will use format="pickle" otherwise.

No <attr> element will be written if both json.dumps and pickle.dumps fail. Attribute failures will create a warning for the plugin developer.

<edge> elements
===============

<edge> elements will have the form::

    <edge type="child" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Leo will use type="child" to represent Leo's official edges.
Plugins are free to define any type except "child". Examples::

    <edge type="undirected" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="bidirectional" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="backlink" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="myPlugin" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Descendant attributes in @file trees
====================================

Descendants of @file nodes do not appear in .leo files. Thus, important data must be stored in the so-called hidden machinery: attributes of the @file node.

The <at-file-attributes> element may be contained in the <node> element for @file nodes::

    <at-file-attributes>
        <attr>key="ua-name"
            format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"
            gnx="gnx">value
        </attr>
        ...
    </at-file-attributes>
    
In other words, we use the graphml <attr> element, extended with the gnx attribute, to represent all the uA's in the descendants of @file nodes.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/2ddb57c62e67825c

Leo's file format: version 3, draft 5

This draft is intended to reflect minimal changes from Leo's present file format, but with improvements mentioned at the Ashland sprint and developed afterward.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted for use as a json file format.

This draft contains significant invention by EKR. See the next section. Don't panic: it can be changed :-)

Summary of changes from draft 4
===============================

- Elements will be renamed as follows::

    old         new
    ====        ====
    <vnodes>    <directed-acyclic-graph>
    <tnodes>    <data-list>
    <v>         <node>
    <t>         <data>

- Nesting of <node> elements represents the structure of the DAG,
  just as nesting of <v> elements does at present.
  
- Thus, there will be no <edge> elements.

- Headlines will move from <v> elements to <data> elements.
  This "normalizes" the data: headlines will appear only once.
  
- <attr> elements will represent uA's.  A full discussion below.

  Ideally, I would like to support only string and json formats
  for <attr> elements.  This is open to discussion. 

- Only <node> elements will contain <attr> elements.

- <node> elements for @file nodes will contain
  <at-file-attributes> elements, representing Leo's "hidden
  machinery" attributes.  <at-file-attributes> will contain
  <attr> elements. 

First lines
===========

Leo file will start with the following::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo: http://leoeditor.com/leo_toc.html -->
    <leo_file file_format="3"
        xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
        
No session data
===============

There will be no <globals>, <preferences> or <find_panel_settings> elements. All such "session data" will be restored from the cache, or from defaults if caching is disabled.

**Important**: there is no representation of expansion state or the currently selected node anywhere in the .leo file. Eliminating these data is contingent on having Leo work well with caching disabled.

Note: marks are more than session data. They must appear within <node> elements.


Summary of format
=================

.leo files will have the following form, with similar indentation::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo: http://leoeditor.com/leo_toc.html -->
    <leo_file file_format="3" xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>

        </node>
        <node id="gnx">
            <!-- contained v elements, if any.
        </node>
        ...
    </directed-acyclic-graph>
    <data-list>
        <data id="gnx">
            <!-- marked attribute appears only if the tnode/vnode is marked -->
            <head>headline text</head>
            <attr key="marked">1</attr>

            <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
            <attr key="c" format="pickle">a pickled string</attr>
            <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
            ...
            <body>body text</body>
        </data>
        ...
    </data-list>
    </leo_file>

<attr> elements
===============

<attr> elements will one of the following forms::

    <attr key="a">a unicode string</attr>
    <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="c" format="pickle">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
    
The value will be a string by default.

If possible, I would like to support only the string and json
formats. This would make the data as transparent as possible.
Please mentally amend the following discussion...

uA's that start with "binhex_" will use the binhex format. This
prefix must be retained in the type field, so the read code can
restore them.

If the value is not a string, and there is no "binhex_" prefix,
the write code will use format="json" if json.dumps succeeds, and
will use format="pickle" otherwise.

No <attr> element will be written if both json.dumps and
pickle.dumps fail. Attribute failures will create a warning for
the plugin developer.

====================================

Descendants of @file nodes do not appear in .leo files. Thus, important data must be stored in the so-called hidden machinery: attributes of the @file node.

The <at-file-attributes> element may optionally be contained in the <node> element for @file nodes::

This draft is intended to reflect our recent discussions, with no new invention from me. All comments and corrections welcome.

The draft is also intended to be compatible with graphml.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted for use as a json file format.

I am willing to change "type" to "key" in <edge> elements if that would be preferable.

Recent changes
==============

- Added <graphml> element defining the default namespace.

- Defined the leo namespace for leo-only elements.
    - Renamed <leo_file> to <leo:outline>
    - Renamed <descendant-attributes> to <leo:at-file-attributes>

- Used <leo:at-file-attributes> for marks, removing the special case.

- Enclosed <leo:descendant-attributes> in a (graphml) <data> element.

- Changed the format of the "marked" attribute to be a string-valued attribute.

<attr> elements
===============

<attr> elements will one of the following forms::

    <attr key="a">a unicode string</attr>
    <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="c" format="pickle">a json string</attr>

Descendant attributes in @file trees
====================================

Descendants of @file nodes do not appear in .leo files. Thus, important data must be stored in the so-called hidden machinery: attributes of the @file node.

The <leo:at-file-attributes> element may be contained in the <node> element for @file nodes. For compatibility with graphml, it will enclosed in a data element::
    
    <data>
        <leo:at-file-attributes>
            <attr>key="ua-name"
                format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"

            </attr>
            ...
        </leo:at-file-attributes>
    </data>
    
In other words, we use the graphml <attr> element, extended with the gnx attribute, to represent all the uA's in the descendants of @file nodes.

It requires a translation layer, either to (un)munge the name or
(un)pickle. Real problem?

Let's say each time I think 'I can use UAs to store that' I change
my mind when I realize my values will be in a pickle. (I really don't
want to name all my attributes str_xxx)

How is it done in any other XML file? I've not used XML for arbitrary data, but it probably can be done.

> Why would that way be better than pickle?

My suspicion is that UAs would be used more for storing text and numbers (as seems common for XML files) than Python data objects.

Does Leo use UAs to store pickles?

I'm sure pickling capability is great, but I'm not convinced it should be the _default._

No big deal.
.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21349: *4* Should @nosent put headlines as comments?
From: "Edward K. Ream" <edreamleo@gmail.com>

I've been blind all these years!  @nosent should put headlines as nodes a comments.  They would be very useful and I can see no reason not to put such comments.  If, for some reason, they are not desired, you could use
@asis.

===== Ville

I use @nosent for non-code text mostly, and it's not clear what "comment" should mean in that context.

I for sure would like this kind of feature, but sometimes I'd like to have the headlines written as reST style headlines (underlines), etc.

So this is not a complete no-brainer modification.

===== EKR

I agree.  Some more thought is needed.

===== Ville

Instead of changing how Leo fundamentally behaves (@nosent is part of that), how about adding a new @directive that allows things like this? E.g. "@write a.txt" would be nice & "obvious".

===== EKR

In this case, adding support for a new directive might be more complicated than changing @nosent :-)

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/eb718b4c6d478ac0

I'm just getting started learning how to use Leo. Now, I'd like to use it for some of my projects, but there's no chance that I can convert everyone at work to using it, so putting sentinel-filled files in our repository is out of the question. At the same time, my code looks awfully bare without sentinels because the documentation ends up in the section names, not the comments!

So, I was wondering if there's a convenient way to pull the section names into a comment at the start of each section?

===============

Interesting question.  Am I correct in assuming you are using @nosent trees to generate your files?  If so, it would be easy to add support for the following options:

@bool write_section_comments_in_at_nosent_trees
@bool write_node_name_comments_in_at_nosent_trees

The first would write a sentinel consisting of only the section name;
the second would write a sentinel consisting only of the node's headline
(for nodes whose headline is not a section name).

These seem like they would be useful additions.  One can even imagine
corresponding Leo directives so that the comments could be turned on or off
within an @nosent tree.

What do you think?

That sounds like an excellent solution. Particularly the last bit -- if you could turn section-comments on and off as required, it would become very convenient to use Leo to produce source that is intended to also be read by non Leo users.

How could we  treat leo tree as flat, contiguous memory structure (something that's easy to memcpy, pass as shared memory or flush to disk in one write)?

Some ideas could be: 

- Use Redis to store tree
- Keep the "clean" body texts in contiguous block (most bodies will always be clean), append dirty (modified) body texts after it
- Keeping the outline structure in memory block is quite easy, since there is not a lot of data. You could have just a list of [parent, child] id's or whatever

From: Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

This thread will need Ville to set it on the right track, I barely know the names of the technologies, but Qt has been advancing with, quoting from their site:

Qt Quick

The Qt UI Creation Kit lets you create rich, touch-enabled UIs and
apps...quickly.

  * QML - CSS & JavaScript like language, same code base for UI
    designers & developers

  * Supported by Qt Creator IDE for rapid prototyping and development

  * Qt Quick UI runtime - Direct access to native APIs, performance
    boost with C++

I think the first bullet is most relevant to Leo.  Could we embed this kind of environment in Leo?  Can it be integrated effectively with the current GUI?

That route might make adding task specific GUIs in Leo quick and easy.

Not for the touch part (although Leo on a tablet would be fun), but as a way of quickly creating task specific GUIs, "forms" if you like, for accessing / interacting with the data in a Leo outline.  I'm assuming that QML is higher level / less coding the regular PyQt programming, but I don't know that, not having tried it.

===== Ville

QML is actually lower level than QWidgets / "regular" PyQt programming. Key selling point of QML is that the UI's are more free form, "custom" and much faster than QWidget UI's (in Qt5, QML maps quite naturally to OpenGL, making it fly on mobile phone/tablet hardware).

QML would be natural for graphcanvas / tabula / other "custom" ui plugins, but it doesn't yet have text editor as powerful as QTextEdit, not tree widget as powerful as QTreeWidget / QTreeView.

I expect QML to be first used in mobile version of Leo (I have one actually, that I will publish "at later date" ;-). For desktop, QML is not yet as attractive as the "old stuff".

From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

Hey,

No time to mock this up right now, just throwing it out there.

"tabula" plugin allowed you to edit many nodes simultaneously in an MDI canvas - i.e. you could move the body editors around freely.

How about taking this idea further and locking the body editors in a grid, or column?

One fun idea would by layout like this

            | Child 1
Outline  | Child 2
            | Child3

That is, you would edit and view all the children of the currently focused node all at once. We can already do two body editors at once, so this would seem like natural extension.

Of course you could only see a small amount of text per body, but for a "workbook" / sheet like use cases it would be fine.

Yes.  This might the key.

As I was thinking about doing body editors with free_layout (and by
extension, the tabula editors) I had another new thought: it's time to
replace the present difficult selection code with a broadcaster/
listener framework.

In particular, the multiple body editor code is on the verge of
collapse because it tries to figure out too much in a spaghetti-like
mass of logic.  This doesn't generalize, and Leo is becoming so
"exuberant" in its IDE that a simpler, more general mechanism is
becoming essential.

Tabula is part of the stickynotes plugin.  It creates the following commands:

         tabula
         tabula-marked
         tabula-show
         tabula-subtree

The "windowlets" show the node's headline. So this is the "sea of nodes" view!

The tabula nodes are "live": changes made in the tabula window
instantly affect the corresponding nodes in the regular outline.

An easter egg: double-clicking the title of a windowlet fills the
tabula window with the windowlet.  Another double-click undoes the
expansion.

> How about taking this idea further and locking the body editors in a

Good idea.  The tabula window is a great playground for invention.

In the "multi-colored link" world (coming soon, I hope), we could
imagine commands that create "tabula-colored" links, so that the
tabula window would work like a chapter.  (And each chapter would have
its own links).

The Light Table video suggested something else that I never considered
before.  Suppose each node "carries" its own mini-context outline,
showing just the parents of the node.  The tabula window might be
natural for that.

The idea is that each windowlet would have two parts:  the top would
show the parents, the bottom would show the body pane.  This allows
context to be visible without actually having to show the outline
pane.

If you fill the cells with stickynotes (as in tabula), the editors would at
least stick to the nodes.

Otoh, if more felxible body editors are just around the corner, it may not
be worth the hassle.

'publish / subscribe' has buzzword cred these days, there are several
protocols out there, reportedly fairly simple to implement, don't know
if any are a fit here.

Attached screen-shot shows the potential for free-layout with the new
Open Window command to open a separate window as a 'grid' editor.  Here
instead of body editors I just have 5 view-rendered panes open, and
they're all looking at the same node because there's no mechanism for
locking them to separate nodes presently(*).  Free layout could handle
body editors in the same way, if they were more agnostic about their
containers.

Cheers -Terry

(*) I think there's a way to lock/unlock a special case singleton
view-rendered pane, but not a flock of them like this.

You are probably right. We Could also adjust the sizes dynamically

Ok, but I still think it makes sense to implement this with the
free-layout system, so that your grid could be a separate window, or
not, as desired.  free-layout is basically nested QSplitters, so it can
represent a grid, but with more flexibility (cell 1,0 doesn't have to
be the same height as cell 0,0, etc.)

I often use "Edit in notepad" (or more likely pyscripter) for this
purpose. It would be nice to stay inside Leo; I sometimes lose data by
forgetting which editor has the most current version.

Plus, free-layout provides persistence: it's worth putting effort into
configuring pane configuration because it will be available next time.

(I guess I'm persistent about wanting persistence)

Although such a framework might be quite useful, I can't help thinking
it would insert a big delay between now and getting flexible body
editors implemented.

I think that getting body editors working as described in my recently
bumped "Free range body editors" post would not be that hard, certainly
simpler and faster than a broadcaster / listener framework.  And the
current multiple body editors code could just be dropped completely, so
while I suspect you're right about it being on the edge of implosion, I
don't think that's a problem :-)

I am bringing another angle into play here - systematic selection of what
nodes are shown in the editors, in the proposed scheme we would have a
single column of editors, each displaying every child of currently selected
node.

Expanding the scope to a grid, we could have a grid-lock-column that would
freeze the current column, allowing you to move the selected position in
the tree to another node, and locking the nodes for column 2 etc etc

Woohoo - done and pushed.  Went for the second option, instead of
pop-out windows holding a single widget, they hold a whole new
free-layout hierarchy, which of course can be a single widget, or much
more, if you want.  See the 'Open Window' command on the free-layout
splitter handle context menu.

Even made a screencast to demonstrate, but unfortunately the sound was
useless, despite being ok in trials before hand.  Might try again later.

When the body editor is a well behaved widget it should be straight
forward to place them where ever you want in using the free-layout
mechanism.  I think that's a better goal, it allows you more
flexibility in terms of maybe one small (both dimensions) and one large
editor, for example.

The new broadcaster/listener framework should probably be designed to
handle this.  That is, in the new framework it should explicitly be
possible to select multiple nodes.

No, although that gives me another idea...

Another feature I've wanted to add to free_layout is popping out any
element into its own window (replacing sticky-notes).  You could go one
better and pop-out free-layout frames which could contain multiple
widgets, like tabula currently does.

I'll try and get those features into free-layout.  Note that a couple
of widgets already have their own pop-out capability, the body editor
and view-rendered.

Also some frame manipulation tools in free-layout would be good.  To
maximize / restore one frame, and layout frames in a grid, if there was
an intent to replace tabula.

Not that tabular needs replacing, but I think it's benefits can be
generalized.

Xiki.org gives a demo of a "wiki" shell for command execution. Leo should be able to do the same thing (and more!), in the sense that leoscreen, for example, has two way communication with the command line. I suppose a "Lxiki" is really just a question of setting up the right shortcuts (like a shift-ctrl-b that would run highlighted python code from the command line... with a tmp file?).

From: wgw <wgwinder@gmail.com>

Thanks for the tip -- it will take me a while to get my head around vspace (will keep an eye on Ville's blog post).

I'm just beginning to appreciate (or imagine) what Ipython, sublime text editor, leo, xiki, etc could mean for some kind of intelligent document workbench. Of course the big hurdle is not so much the string processing (sublime is a good example of how that can be done), but rather the syntax processing -- i.e. the docbench  (to coin a phrase) should understand the syntax of whatever is being input and then offer syntax-aware functions.... Sorry, getting a little obscure: all I mean by syntax-aware is the ability to propose text completions (Leo's autocompletion is a good example -- everything should work like autocomplete!) and allow for intelligent text changes depending on a database of information (for example, a search and replace that would  know how to search on "caterpillar" and turn it into "butterfly" but would not touch "caterpillar truck").

Seems like Leo is not far from doing that synthesis, but it would require more database integration. So for example, even the python help system does not have autocomplete. (No criticism there! The great thing about Leo is that if you want something, you just have to dive in and build it. My day job might just let me do that!)

Just to clarify, vs-eval, vs-last, vs-last-pretty are quite straight forward, as I described them below, and do not require comprehension of the esoterica of value-space :-) I just put them in that plugin (a) to avoid creating yet another plugin, and (b) because it seemed sensible to have them use the value-space namespace c.vs, but all that means for vs-eval, vs-last, vs-last-pretty is that

  a =3D 7

executed by vs-eval assigns a value to a which can be used by subsequent vs-eval calls (persistent for the lifetime of the session).

For example, make a body with this text

a =3D 7
b =3D 3
a + b

and place the cursor in front of the first 'a'

execute (Alt-x or key binding) vs-eval 4 times

 - first time executes the empty selection and selects the next line
 - second time assigns 7 to a and report 7 in the log
 - third time assigns 3 to b and report 3 in the log
 - forth time calculates a + b and report 10 in the log

executing vs-last(-pretty) would insert the last result (None, 7, 3,
10) in the body.

Got it! The value of valuespace (!) is that that you can make a pythonesque session persist. I did not realize that there was no direct two-way bridge to the python window that leo launches. Even if there were, we would want to make the session persist by logging it into the outline, as valuespace (vs-create-tree) does.

From: Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

In addition to the outline as a active data document functions of Ville's value-space plugin, I recently added some simple ;-) commands::

    Alt+A vs-eval
    Alt+S vs-last
    Alt+D vs-last-pretty
    (my key bindings)

vs-eval evaluates the selected python in the c.vs namespace.  It makes an effort to workout what the output should be, and puts it in the log.  It captures print output to the log too.  It selects the next line, ready for execution.

vs-last inserts the last result into the body, and vs-last-pretty does the same, but using pprint formatting.

Ctrl-B also runs the script in the body, but not in a persistent namespace, running only the selected text doesn't seem to be working, and it doesn't work so hard to work out the output.

I guess leoscreen would do the same things as the vs-* commands if you used it against a python shell.  The inspiration for the vs-* commands was wanting Leo to tell you what 3.57 * 365 / 12 was without a lot of effort, but of course you can define functions etc. etc.

Leo as PIM and authoring tool

Josef <joe_da@gmx.net> 7/30/12
		
Recently I evaluated docear - a mind-mapping tool for collecting reference data (written in Java). It automatically extracts bookmarks and annotations from PDF files, and more, but it's support for authoring is still not up to the task. I think it would be great if Leo could do some of the tasks docear is doing.

Dragging a PDF into Leo currently just creates an url to the PDF. This could be expanded to also extract data (bookmarks, notes) from the PDF and to sync this data between Leo and the PDF. This info could be placed in child nodes: bookmarks and notes could even jump directly to the page in the PDF (although each PDF viewer seems to have a different syntax for doing that). This would be a great way to organize data sheets and specifications stemming from external sources.

Combining the above with an improved LaTeX support, one would get a very powerful research and authoring tool - in my opinion with a much more convenient interface than docear.

Perhaps it is too much work to duplicate all the work docear is doing. An alternative may be to sync data somehow between docear and Leo. Docear stores the data in a freeplane mind-map. Has anyone else thoughts about this? Offray Vladimir Luna Cárdenas offray@riseup.net via googlegroups.com
	
7/30/12
		
I have been using Leo to write my thesis. I didn't know about Docear, but my use was in some sense similar. I have a lot of @url links pointint to the pdfs files and in a subtree I cut and paste the text of the pdf I want to comment and made the comments inside the tree. These pdf were part of my bibliographic entries and I'm now writing a .bib file for these, so I can have in only one Leo tree all my thesis, with all the references to external files and the annotations and bibtex entries for them. For me the key point of Leo in academic writing is the tree view plus the clones and ignore nodes. My thesis can have several layers, the external ones being the actual writing and the deeper ones the references, texts, images, tools that enable me to do that writing. Using clones and @rst-no-head directives I can have the level of granularity of a paragraph, something that is not possible on traditional word processor which are the writing tool of tools like docear. This approach have some glitches:

* I still need to do some fine tunning to the LaTeX export for writing the pdf as I want. I imagine that putting sphinx in the tool chain could change that.

* I can not get much people of my companions using this advangages, besides of myself, because of the difficult installation process of Leo in Windows/Mac and the not so friendly interface for non-programmers. Other light markup structured text writing programs like Nested[1] are more easily used and understood despite of not having all the advantages and flexibility of Leo.

So, in resume, may be the better approach is connecting Leo to Docear, so you can have the advantages of both in terms of easy multiplataform installation and friendly interface of the later and programmability, flexibility and deeper organic structure of the former.

I'm not really sure how notes get embedded in PDFs.  As an aside, there is also capability for using Leo to manage bookmarks to web pages, with notes, tags, and snippets.  Look at the mod_http plugin.  It uses a javascript bookmark button in your browser to communicate with Leo.

Syncing between the two sounds a little cumbersome to me.  I wonder if the PDF stuff could be integrated with some sort of BibTeX .bib file management?

Do you really need the mindmap UI of docear?  I used to use Freemind which has a very similar interface, but switched to Leo.  I like what http://cmap.ihmc.us/ does, but it only does idea organization, no authoring etc.  To me cmaptools is better at idea organizing than mindmaps.

There is also the backlinks plugin for Leo, which allows arbitrary networks of links instead of just the directed tree, and graphcanvas, which allows graph layout of nodes.  There aren't comparable with the mindmap layouts, but they head in that direction.  Also note Leo's hidden UI flexibility in the context menus on the pane dividers, you can open a new window for the graphcanvas plugin, which gives it much needed screen real estate.

Cheers -Terry

no, I do not need the mindmap stuff at all. I had a look at short look at cmaptools, and I agree the generalized graph approach seems better than a standard mindmap. But I am quite happy with the tree view in Leo and as you already mentioned, this can be extended with backlinks etc. I have used Leo already to organize reference documents and write documentation (using Latex).

What I do want is links to a particular page of a PDF - links to just a file are not enough when you refer to documents with 100+ pages. Unfortunately this seems to be difficult to achieve in a cross-platform way, particular when trying to support different PDF viewers. Docear is solving this (and other compatibility problems) by developing its own integrated viewer (I do not suggest to do this for Leo).

On second thought, I don't think that extracting the bookmark and annotation info is really important to me - I would keep that info in the PDF, anyhow. I would write inside Leo addional notes, and the output text (in Latex).

Some integration of Bibtex may be a good thing and needs to be thought out. perhaps by using JabRef for this, or by recycling some pyBibliographer code, but this is also low on my priority list.

Offray seems to have a very similar use case as I - although I do not write a thesis, but specifications for scientific instruments. The point about cross-platform installation ease is also well taken, so I will look into some inter-operability here (either with docear or cmaptools). I see Leo mainly as a personal project / information manager: the leo tree is not easily shared with others, while the files Leo points to with @url, @auto,
@file etc can be shared quite easily. In this I use Leo as *my personal*
view on the project.

It seems that e.g. w/ foxit reader, you can open selected page from command line (-n 123). Abstracting this for other pdf readers that support such a thing should be no problem.

Yes, I suppose one could translate from a canonical representation inside Leo to whatever the tool needs (using @setting). Ideally, one would even have a choice between opening the new page in a different or in the same PDF viewer instance as the last page, but few viewers support that (Okular does - but I don't know any cross-platform solution).
.. @+node:ekr.20031218072017.790: *4* Import dialog improvements
Other options I though would be really handy:

1. Use an existing node as a source also

2. Use an node from another Leo file.. I am not sure what the syntax for that
would be exactly

3. From a URL.. this would be really cool. People could post outlines not only
as existing Leo xml files, but as text files or even dynamic scripts. The code
to handle these would presumably need to deal with http:// intelligently. But
that's easy in Python. Rebol is great at that too.

4. Other XML file with valid filepaths in them.
That's probably a much bigger project like Leo 3.10

.. @+node:ekr.20060227124411: *4* Import/export from wiki's
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3583737
By: Offray

I was previously thinking in the relation between Leo and Wikis, and I think that may be a thing that would help to make Leo more visible in Wiki space could be if Leo can export/import to/from a Wiki (something limilar to th @file or @url directives). Let me explain a little better the scenary where this idea come.

We have a local wiki for colombian Free Software Community related issues, and I have used Leo for writing the migration scripts from Mediawiki to MoinMoin (wich I think is more flexible and extensible that the popular wiki behind wikipedia). I was probing also the idea of a Wiki like environment for solving colaborative problems, so I was posting the scripts I made on Leo in a Wiki page, and republishing them in the moment they changed. This keeps me pasting all the time the script and in some moments I was thinking what about if someone make a change in the Wiki page. Would be nice then to have the same capability to detect and sincronize that change as Leo make with the hard disk files.

But this doesnt end here. Another Wiki-Leo interaction is to use outlines as a way to organice Wiki content. For example "= Title =" in a Wiki would be a Outline Node in Leo and "== Subtitle ==" Would become a outline subnode all arranged in the proper hierarchy.

Somekind of Wisiwyg display would be nice, but this must be a plugin or something like that, so Leo could become a "Layered" front end to some kind of data.

About and article on Wikipedia. That would be nice, but I'm a little tired of fighting with some wikipedians ignorance on certain matters combined with power (a pretty bad combination). I think that a Wiki page is nice because its live comes from the community knowledge, but I'm not interested in that fighting, so I have made a Leo wiki page in our local Wiki:

http://www.el-directorio.org:8080/Leo

and when I have enough knowledge about Leo (and time) I hope to start making contribs in the spanish documentation (for the moment I'm only workind in the evangelism here).

The :substitute command searches for a text pattern, and replaces it with a text string. There are many options, but these are what you probably want:

:%s/foo/bar
:%s/foo/bar/
    Replace first occurrence of 'foo' with 'bar' in all lines.

:%s/foo/bar/g
     Replace all occurrences of 'foo' with 'bar' in all lines.
   
:s/foo/bar/
    Replace first occurrence of 'foo' (on the current line) with 'bar'

:s/foo/bar/g
    Replace all occurrence of 'foo' (on the current line ), with 'bar'.
    
Flags:
/gi case insensitive
/gI case sensitive
/gw word insensitive
/gW word sensitive
    
===== It's pointless to ask for confirmation: in that case, use Leo's search commands.

:%s/foo/bar/gc
    Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first. 

:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc
    Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 

:%s/foo/bar/gci
    Change each 'foo' (case insensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 
    This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default).

The "--> mode-help" command has the following issues related to the

1. Key label always capitalized.

Vim commands are mapped to both lower-case and upper-case keys but always appear
mapped to upper-case keys within the "Help" tab.

2. Layout of tab's contents.

To improve readability and better support narrow tab cards, display the mode's
label without the "enter-" and "-mode" text and place the key label before the
mode label.

For example, the following entries would change from::
    enter-vi-delete-line-mode d

a node's headline text.  Instead, the command is performed on the

Using the "undo" command (key 'u') to undo a change to a node's headline text
only works correctly after another node has been selected. It appears that

Some commands can be "easily" repeated by having the command's mode
bind itself to the period key.  This is not currently working.  

Support commands requesting input:

Add companion commands that reuse input.  For example, a zap-to-
character-again command could exist which will reuse the key entered
in the last zap-to-character command.  With this support, the mode
that performs the initial command would assign the period key to a
companion mode that is identical to the initial mode but with the zap-
to-character command replaced by the zap-to-character-again command.

Commands requiring companion commands are:
  zap-to-character
  find-character
  backward-find-character
  (Any others?)

Notes:

- The copy of the character should be saved somewhere that does NOT affect the
  contents of the clipboard.

- The same or a separate storage location can be used for all commands to retain
  a copy of the character entered by the user. It doesn't matter since only the
  last command is assigned to the period key to be re-executed.

===== @ns-* write logic

In his initial post, Rob said, "when I change my @auto-rst files to @nosent
files, the resulting files do not contain the RST section headers that were
automatically added by @auto-rst."

This proves that @ns-rst must have special logic that writes the proper
section headers. Happily, this can be done easily with special cases in
at.putOpenNodeSentinel. Ditto for @ns-md, @ns-vimoutline and @ns-otl.

From https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/QxK2V62ESLw/vCSolavmw4YJ

===== @ns-* read logic

No change is actually *required* for @ns-rst and @ns-md. When reading an
@ns-rst or @ns-md file, added sections could be slurped into the outline as
under/overlining text. The user could leave the changed node as it is. Or
the user could create a new node with the indicated headline. Either way,
the @ns-rst write logic would recreate the changed file.

However, a simple, fast post-pass in the @ns-rst/md read logic could create
the new nodes automagically. The post-pass would traverse the tree created
by the @nosent logic looking for under/overlined lines (or # lines for md),
creating new nodes as needed. The actual code would be similar to the
@auto-rst logic,but it exists in a far simpler context than @auto-rst.

Post passes are probably *required* for @ns-vimoutline and @ns-otl. Indeed,
vimoutline or otl sentinels should *never* be left as plain text in an
existing node. The "raw" sentinels would corrupt the vim or Emacs outline
if the node were later moved. An unpleasant time bomb.
.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21337: *4* Unlikely: better C importer
From: ne1uno <eltronis@gmail.com>

wouldn't it be great to have a first class c importer?

hiding the complexity of platform & compiler/option #defines. invisible (TM) nodes would be fruitful here. switched on by @#define. with an @#define=3D collection node or using a bunch of headlines. and an rclick flipper for true/false, defined/not defined declarations.

meanwhile I wait for the inspiration or someone else to nail down a regular expression c language parser. maybe a tokenizer is enough. I did run c code through AStyle then through your old c2py via buttons. for code that would remain in c, in SciTE through google CPPlint program to point up flaws, and to get the context sensitive help from various CHM. running flawfinder good to do now and then old or new code. post processing and displaying the report in a browser. but it doesn't go far enough & too many false positives.

there is splint, maybe the only free lint left. the need to inject "hints" all over the code make it less than ideal for perusing unknown source and generally a deal breaker for project code. sometimes all you need is a function/var list to get by. deeper static analysis is quite the serious business. so, it's not a surprise those programs are not easily found, or used. there are a few code flow programs that could be harnessed to colorize headlines indicating relations. taking all this in, marking nodes that need work with a popup or tooltip action event when you view that node with the details of one or another parser to annotate what needs work.

we have had a few plugins/buttons/attempts at designing an interface to get a program node compiled. this is also a decent way to get info on the quality of code by turning all warnings on. fails for snippits. never quite simple to hookup or modify painless. perhaps the biggest problem is knowing what is available and where. more toolbars, no reason they can't dock. drag & dropping buttons. one of the huge advantages of Qt over Tk so far barely tapped. you begin to accept the fact that you need to create a temp file instead of real process control. managing program quirks & options becomes more trouble than it's worth just to protect the purity of the operation sans temp files. QTprocess has more options than the process in pythons libs. if it ever works as well as it should. but, a little hard to wrap. not going to venture a guess if pyqt gets it right or not. not to mention how bungled up OS process control still is. process control will be essential to any inter-process operations. that is, unless you backslide into wanting to build everything "in" and invent everything new again. re: blender, I haven't looked at blender code in a while, but I would be shocked if there weren't some well established way to hook into a script. sounds like noone has found them yet.

not sure how to grab a window handle on other OS but for windows it's fairly straight forward. blender or GTK could setup blocks. another great Qt based project is universal indenter, a front end

for many indenters for many languages. this would be a good place to look for how to manage inter-process communication in Qt. a first class editor will have to include first class importer for javascript at the least and probably lua and one or two others. one could imagine niceties like clickable links on #include files. right clickable options on them such as import, simple view, htmlize.

also about styles, astyle has the options on the commandline, the builtin/compiled in defaults and an ~/.astyle.rc for personal style. some will find an indenter that has no options useless. I know the indenter created is purely for internal use, as it were, at this point. adding selectable options later will complicate the program and for most use will have little payback. you may as well expect to have some want a plugable option for style. exposing a general use tokenizer could have many callers.

Summary: The improved Execute Script command does most of this

Michael Manti
mmanti@mac.com

The feature that could make Leo *the* IDE for developing in interpreted languages is something like the (X)Emacs comint-mode.el for interacting with the shell and interpreters.

comint-mode.el serves as the basis for interactive modes for a number of languages--OCaml, Haskell, SML, among them. It allows for editing expressions in one buffer and triggering their evaluation in another buffer that has an interpreter running in it, along with entering commands in the interpreter buffer and moving back and forth through the history of their evaluation.

Imagine being able to highlight a node in Leo, and have all the code in it and its children evaluated in an interpreter running in a separate window or pane, much as Leo can open a Python shell now. Users of those languages could build plug-ins specific to their language atop that layer, and the @language directive could activate that. I think that would be very cool.

.. @+node:ekr.20071004120359.2: *5* expand-region-abbrev
See: regionalExpandAbbrev.

You may wish to expand an abbrev with a prefix attached; for example, if `cnst' expands into `construction', you might want to use it to enter `reconstruction`. It does not work to type recnst, because that is not necessarily a defined abbrev. What you can do is use the command M-' (abbrev-prefix-mark) in between the prefix `re' and the abbrev `cnst`. First, insert `re`. Then type M-'; this inserts a hyphen in the buffer to indicate that it has done its work. Then insert the abbrev `cnst'; the buffer now contains `re-cnst'. Now insert a non-word character to expand the abbrev `cnst' into `construction'. This expansion step also deletes the hyphen that indicated M-' had been used. The result is the desired `reconstruction'.

If you actually want the text of the abbrev in the buffer, rather than its expansion, you can accomplish this by inserting the following punctuation with C-q. Thus, foo C-q , leaves `foo,' in the buffer.

Well, personally I'd like to have them included in the definition, but I think Kent's preference for a separate node is reasonable to. If your function and hence definition node is called "pluralize", and it's decorated with something like "@authenticate_user", you may never check the innocent looking pluralize definition to find out what on earth's triggering the mysterious network database call. And this isn't a completely specious example, authentication may have been added to stop pluralize being used in a user existence detection exploit or something. OTOH in well behaved code like CherryPy apps you don't want a separate node for every @cherrypy.expose.

Bottom line is I think we're asking for a set of @settings to fine tune python import behavior::

    @python_import_interdef = previous | next | own_node | ai
    @python_import_decoration = next | own_node

I'm not sure I believe the AI option is possible / practical, and am not asking for it, just listing it :-)

I'd also like::

    @python_import_init_in_class_node = true | false

as often there's more docs on a class in the __init__ than the class docstring.

I think that's really all we're talking about, some @settings to test during import.

From: Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

I often need to save 4, 6, even more open changed Leo files at once.  Mainly when I'm filing / adjusting todo items, although at the end of a session having 4 changed files open can't be that unlikely.

So it would be really nice if c.saveAll() could be threaded.  Even as I write this, it gets more complicated...

  - each thread should do no user interface calls, or at least no calls
    that aren't deferred to the main thread

    - that's ok, would take quite a bit of tracing to catch them all,
      but doable - except - plugins called from save hooks might break
      the rule

  - updating recent files list would have to be done properly, not a
    big deal

  - multiple threads saving to the same external files would be a
    problem, that's the complication that only just occurred to me

I don't typically have the same external file referenced from multiple Leo files, why would you do that... so the last problem, although potentially major, might be theoretical more than practical.

Hmm, well it's a thought.  First thing to check, is saving IO bound or CPU bound...

I'm pretty sure saving is cpu bound; for "normal" size documents, flushing that kind of stuff to disk (or memory buffers that are to be written to disk) shouldn't take significant amount of time.

I've just found that, because these todo items are always in the outline itself and not external files, I can just do 'write outline only' on all the open outlines, and this is much faster and smooths out the bump in my workflow that got me started thinking about this.

Probably right, so could you use `multiprocessing` instead of `threading`?  More challenging implementation wise, but I'm wondering if it's even possible, in terms of handing over the in-memory data structure?
.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21448: *5* Re: threaded saveAll()
From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

Multiprocessing based implementation will likely be quite hard, and once you walk the trees anyway and copy the data over the process boundary, it could cause bad pauses in execution.

I have often thought how nice it would be to have "flat" storage for the leo document, so that you could just copy over a flat chunk of memory and let other processes traverse that. Doing that is a somewhat nontrivial undertaking, to say the least :).

I'd just start with threads, despite the GIL problems.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/014fe61ff9480b2b

I don't know if this is relevant or not, but the IPython autocompletion
capability is awesome.

If I'm investigating code I tend to do the following.

list the modules in a package:
In [1]: from fs import <tab>

this lists the modules, in a package so I pick one
In [1]: from fs import osfs
<the osfs entry is tab-completable>

now I can check the usage of fs.osfs
In [2]: osfs? <enter>

or the source:
In [2]: osfs?? <enter>

or the contents of the module
In [2]: osfs. <tab>

I can instantiate a class:
In [3]: myfs = osfs.OSFS('/')

and examine the ivars and methods:
In [4]: myfs. <tab>

It is such an efficient way to learn and remember the details of code.

I know a bunch of work was done on Leo/IPython integration, don't
know the current status, my wish of synchronized IPython and Leo
may well be one of the many granted wishes I have forgotten about.

I certainly think IPython autocompletion is the gold standard.

I will wait. Here's clarification, when you're ready for it:

All of my projects are stored on remote computers, and accessed via FTP. What I want is basically the ability to open up these projects directly through leo, instead of transferring the files manually between my computer and the computers that hold my projects, preferably through FTP.

My solution: A new menu item called 'FTP' or 'Remote'. Click on this, and an FTP dialog opens up, with an empty list of FTP sites, and the ability to add more. You select a site, and it brings up a list of files. You select a file, and it is added to your project. When you hit 'save', it automatically does an FTP send.

Python makes this a lot easier with the builtin module 'ftplib'. I'm sure there are similar things for C++. I hope you take this idea into consideration.

Here's a hopefully small thing. If you need to place a good sized copyright statement at the top of your files, LEO doesn't handle this case very cleanly. As I'm sure you're aware, you wind up with a matching number of @@first lines for each leading line in your source.

Might we introduce an:

 I Have a (maybe) great idea!   
2004-02-15 04:29

I've been using LEO for a while and finding surprinsingly powerfull new uses now
and then, (hey, not a week passes that i dont think to myself : "why did'nt
anyone thought of that kind of tool that is LEO. It's so stupid to program such
a tool, yet no one thought of doing such a thing ! ")

I was wondering if there was a leo keyword (beginning with "@") that would do a
feature I thought would be great: something such as :
@h
@endh
and of course, similarily...
@f
@endf

Standing for "Header", "End Header", "Footer" and "End Footer". Let me please explain ...

When creating files with @file (or nosentinels) I use the keyword "@others" in
the starting node body of the file and place in the file, as it's decendants
(children, grand-children & so on) some clones of other stuff somewhere else
outside of this file (usualy, clones of parts of program regrouped as children
of a "components" node up in the leo outline. Typical Example:

-Introduction
-+components
-a
-b
-c
-+@file program.BAS
-b
-c
-a

a, b, and c are clones and the @file node contains @others.

As you see, I proceed that way because in older programming languages or in
lower level languages, the order of components such as procs, declarations, etc
as an importance. It also has the implication that << and >> brackets are
irrelevant in my way of using leo.

Now, my feature that I looked for in the doc but could not find (so i suggest it
here in case no one had any need of this before) is that when used in the BODY
of a node part of an "@file" the @h and @endh would define a chunk of text in
the body, you've guessed it, to be added before _each_ children node and ONLY
children no grandchildren or any deeper. But It could also be used INSIDE the
body of a children to define headers or footers for IT'S OWN direct children.

so, eehh, do you see the relevance of such a feature? Have i explained it
clearly? maybe this would help:'

CONST baba=2 AS INTEGER
CONST bebe=7 AS INTEGER

... the beginning and end of each of those "parts-of-a-program" is the same for a potential lot of lines... 

To Be Precise : It's just really for adding something at end or beginning of a
direct children of a node part of an @file in the tangling process.

Is this feature already implemented but i have not found it? I'm pretty sure it easy to implement... what do you people think of this?
Thanks

p.s. I'm the guy who proposed that in the untangling process, a clone would not
be updated by it's _Last-Instance-Found_ in the @file beeing untangled, but
instead updated by the _Last-Modified-One-Found_ in the @file... :)

(ooouuuuhh that would be slick...)

RE: Haskell support

There's a literate programming mode in Haskell (and in a number of other functional programming languages such as Clean & Curry), where the program is in a comment, usually where the line starts with ">" (bird track style, I think it's called), and the comments/documentation are freeform. It would be difficult but cool if Leo could support it, if only because the sentinels in the derived files wouldn't make whole file look so busy.

.. @+node:ekr.20141103113220.10: *4* Won't do: parameterized template nodes
From: Alexandre_Toledo <jalexandretoledo@gmail.com>

As I use Leo to write PL/SQL code, I need to write similar text several times, changing only small parts of it. It would be great if I could create a node with the "template" and then clone it everywhere it should be written, and then providing the parameters to be used in this writing.

Let me try to clarify it. I'd like to create a tree like this:

    +- @file something.sql
       +- Section 1
          + << Clone >> with Parameters A, B
       +- Section 2
          + << Clone >> with Parameters C, D

In this tree, both "Clone" nodes would be generated from a template specified somewhere in the tree, and would have parts of its text replaced with values "A" and "B" in Section 1, and "C" and "D" in Section 2.

I've searched but couldn't find anything like this, then I've thought of trying to write a hook to intercept the "save" command, but couldn't think of a way to pass the parameters; I think the obvious way would be to put the parameters after the "<< >>", but then all cloned nodes are changed, so it wouldn't work.

Another alternative would be creating some kind of directive @something, but I have no idea of how to do that.

Any ideas?

===== EKR: This is not likely ever to happen.
.. @+node:ekr.20141103113220.11: *5* OP: Re: Parameterized template nodes
I've tried it and it's great, I think it will be useful, but it's not what I was thinking of...

Let me try to explain what I had thought about.  What I would like to do is:

 1. create a new .leo file
 2. add a "template" node (eventually with sub nodes) with some ${schema}
    and ${table} macro place holders in its contents
 3. add a @file node to the .leo file
 4. add to this @file node a new one with definitions such as
    schema=3DSCHEMA_NAME and table=3DTABLE_NAME
 5. add as a sub node to this last one a clone from the "template" node;
 6. then, when I save everything, the @file would have "SCHEMA_NAME" and
    "TABLE_NAME" everywhere a "${schema}" or a "${table}" were in the original
    template node.

It would be important that, when I reopen the .leo file later, the macros in the @file node where shown as ${schema} and ${table}, and not as it's substituted text.

Now that I've described it, I can't see how it would be done... The ${macro} place holders should be on the contents of the @file node, so after substitution, how could we recover it?

That's also why the code from Jacob is not what I need (but I'm already thinking of other uses for it :) ): it will create a text when the button is pressed, but the generated nodes will be just static text.

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/p_b2LLBAqps/aTQoyGBec68J

This post discusses a new command line argument for Leo: --uuid

I have no plans to implement --uuid now, but it may have to be done in future.

===== Rationale

Terry has convinced me that collisions between both user ids and timestamps will become more frequent as Leo becomes more popular. Such collisions are not a serious problem at present: the odds of two different people with the same user id sharing .leo files is small.

Nevertheless, a serious problem lurks, one that can not, even in principle, be solved with Leo's present gnx's.

Suppose two people have the same id. Then Leo *must* assume that those people are actually the same person! As I have explained in other post, this can lead to data loss if the two people create two *distinct* nodes with the same gnx, and then try to merge those nodes into the same .leo file. The odds of this happening are small, but increasing.

A good way to solve this problem is to use uuids, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier and python's uuid module: https://docs.python.org/2/library/uuid.html

===== Operation

The --uuid should cause Leo to use uuid's for all *new* gnx's. The uuid option should not convert *existing* gnx's to uuid-based gnx's.

A new Leo command would convert all existing gnx's to uuid-based gnxs. Such mass conversions should *never* be done automatically.

===== Format of uuid-based gnxs

I would like the uuid-based gnx's to use uuid's in *addition* to the id and timestamp fields. Something like::

    id.timestamp..uuid

Alas, that does not seem possible, unless this kind of gnx is written to external files (in node sentinels). But many users would complain that such very-long gnx's clutters external files too much.

So it seems that new-style gnxs would have something like this form::

    ..uuid

The leading dots allow Leo to distinguish this kind of gnx from the old
forms::

    id.timestamp.n
    id.timestamp

provided that dots are not allowed in ids.

===== Summary

Recent work shows that this is not necessary or desirable.
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/130

Leo's uuid-based gnxs can contain neither user ids nor timestamps.

We must ensure we stick with whatever new-style gnx format we choose initially: we don't want to burden Leo with distinguishing between several different forms of uuid-based gnxs.

As for user interface, I'd love to see myLeoSettings with a checkbox interface and filter bar at the top, and a feature to "merge or reset from LeoSettings".

Or maybe something like Firefox's "about:config" would be better suited (and probably faster to build).

.. @+node:ekr.20130919120947.12506: *4* Won't do: Why Leo will never be a web app
There are two reasons why Leo is unlikely ever to be a web app.

1. There are somewhere around a million lines of Python code in Leo's core and plugins. Thus, a *solid* python in javascript system is required. This isn't likely to happen.

2. Creating a Leo outline widget is extremely complex. Even starting with a working javascript outliner, one has to deal with events (commands) coming from Leo scripts rather than from the user.

These seem like the most important obstacles. There may be others, but these
suffice.

The consensus is that this is a bad idea.


Original post:

Leo's plugins manager can and imo should dispatch events registered to a plugin only to commanders for which the plugin is enabled in an @enabled-plugins node.

This would make @enabled-plugins nodes work like all other settings.  Not enabling a plugin in a local (per .leo file) @enabled-plugin node would disable that plugin for that outline even if the plugin is enabled in myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.

In practice, the plugins manager would dispatch an event registered by a plugin to a commander only if the plugin is actually enabled in the commander.  Events would be dispatched as always.  For example:

    def onCreate (tag, keys):
        c = keys.get('c')
        if c: << do something >>

The only difference is that this event handler would be called only for outlines in which the plugin was enabled.
