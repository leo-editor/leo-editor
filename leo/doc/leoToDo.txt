The leoInspect chapter has a good to-do list:
    
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/leoInspect.html#still-to-do

The assignments_to, assignments_using and the new calls_to getters all
specify a pattern to be matched against the the lhs of assignments (or
against function names in the calls_to getter). At present, the pattern
must match as a plain word match, but it would be more natural to use regex
matches. That’s coming.

Three new getters would give leoInspect the ability to replace refactored code:

    o.token_range: Returns pointers the list of tokens comprising o.
    o.text: Returns o’s source text (a string).
    o.text_range: Returns the starting and ending offsets of the text in the file.

These getters are non-trivial to do, but a reasonable design is in place.

> All this means that it would likely be too expensive (or just too

There are two parts to the problem.  Happily, neither requires a
separate tree-traversal class.

A token-info prepass
====================

For each node N of a module's tree, we want to inject the following
two new ivars:

- N.end_lineno: the line number of the last character of the token.
- N.end_col_offset: the (byte) offset of the last character of the
token.

After experimenting with a few traversals last night I suddenly
realized tree structure is irrelevant when computing these fields: we
simply want a **sorted** list of (N.lineno,No.col_offset, N) tuples!

The prepass will use ast.walk(root), to generate the list.  After
sorting the list, the prepass will inject inject N.end_lineno and
N.end_col_offset ivars into each node N by stepping through the list.
The ending values of the previous node on the list are the the same as
the beginning values of the next node on the list.

This prepass need only be done once per module.

token_range
===========

To compute token_range for a *particular* N, we want to discover
values M.end_lineno and M.end_col_offset for M, the **last** token in
N's entire tree.

token_range will do the prepass on the modules tree if necessary.
token_range will then call ast.walk(N) to discover all of N's nodes,
sort the list, and return the last element of the list!

In short, token_range is clean and bullet-proof--a happy result.

2012/05/20: ideas for LeoInspect

- Want hints/cheats that make computations simpler.
    
- A few hours spent on hints/cheats will pay off because such hints are
  descriptive and useful. They are like unit tests in that regards.
    
- Focus on difficult modules: qtGui.py and leoKeys.py.
    
- The assertions for TypedDict and TypedDictOfLists are ugly. We would like
  a lint-like tool to do away with them.

.. @+node:ekr.20110621085435.6531: *5* Fix bug: Improve the find panel and find menu
@nocolor-node

Recently, perhaps it was today, there was a remark made about Leo's
Find panel being confusing for newbies.  I have some sympathy for the
remarks.

1.  Looking at Leo's Edit:Find menu, there is no obvious way of doing
a search/replace operation.  I'll fix this soon after 4.9 final.

2.  The Find tab should make it clearer that it is a summary/status
tab only--not a way of actually initiating or continuing searches.
Perhaps using QLabel widgets instead of (disabled) QTextEdit widgets
for the find/change patterns would help a bit.

Command docs
------------

This will create large docs for individual commands from docstrings.

Base this on print-cmd-docstrings.

Plugins docs


Leo must have a create-plugins-doc script that does the same for
plugins.  A prototype of this script exists somewhere.  Making it an
@command node will make it much more visible. 

Terry wrote plugin_catalog.py.  It is in LeoDocs.leo

File 'Open' or 'Import File' command to follow @path directive
http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/7e508921c85d18bc

Suppose my focus node is under a @path directive, say @path E:
\Documents\Some Folder\

Is there a setting that would cause the 'File>Open' or 'File>Import
File' commands to begin the search dialog in the directory, E:
\Documents\Some Folder\ instead of the last directory used?

Would others find this a useful feature?

@language python
@language rest

1. Imo, it is time to consider adding a typical "startup" file to Leo,
~/leo_config.py, similar to ~/.emacs or ipython_config.py.  This will
make Leo "thicker", that is more professional/standard.

IPython adds lots of bells and whistles to configuration.  Leo
emulates most of them, but .leo_config.py would be a good addition.
Think of .leo_config.py as a lightweight plugin.

leo_config.py should execute after settings have been parsed, but
before plugins have been loaded.  If desired, leo_config.py may
register "start2" event handlers, which execute after all plugins have
been loaded, just before starting the main Qt event loop.

2. Leo commands form a good framework for other solutions to Qt
stylesheet issues.  Consider the following commands::

- qt-stylesheet-set-global-stylesheet
- qt-stylesheet-append-to-global-stylesheet
- qt-stylesheet-set-widget-stylesheet
- qt-stylesheet-append-to-widget-stylesheet

# None of these is easily solvable in Leo's present environment.
.. @+node:ekr.20100112051224.6239: *6* Displaying mode help
The "--> mode-help" command has the following issues related to the
display of the "Help" tab:

1. Key label always capitalized.

Vim commands are mapped to both lower-case and upper-case keys but always appear
mapped to upper-case keys within the "Help" tab.

2. Layout of tab's contents.

To improve readability and better support narrow tab cards, display the mode's
label without the "enter-" and "-mode" text and place the key label before the
mode label.

For example, the following entries would change from::
    enter-vi-delete-line-mode d
    enter-vi-delete-to-begin-of-word-mode b
to::
    d : vi-delete-line
    b : vi-delete-to-begin-of-word

Support the ';' key: repeat the last "To character" or "Find character" command.
.. @+node:ekr.20100113075303.6271: *6* Need mode-oriented bindings
Mapping a number to a command or an @mode node works but can not be used as it
prevents the number from being entered as text while in Vi's insert state.

Binding 'bksp' key to back-char to move back a character in command mode
prevents 'bksp' from deleting characters in text edit mode.
.. @+node:ekr.20080616110054.2: *6* Support vim dot command
The ability to repeat the last editing related command by pressing the period
key is not supported and there is no workaround in place.

Binding keys within nodes:

Some commands can be "easily" repeated by having the command's mode
bind itself to the period key.  This is not currently working.  

Support commands requesting input:

Add companion commands that reuse input.  For example, a zap-to-
character-again command could exist which will reuse the key entered
in the last zap-to-character command.  With this support, the mode
that performs the initial command would assign the period key to a
companion mode that is identical to the initial mode but with the zap-
to-character command replaced by the zap-to-character-again command.

Commands requiring companion commands are:
  zap-to-character
  find-character
  backward-find-character
  (Any others?)

Notes:

- The copy of the character should be saved somewhere that does NOT affect the
  contents of the clipboard.

- The same or a separate storage location can be used for all commands to retain
  a copy of the character entered by the user. It doesn't matter since only the
  last command is assigned to the period key to be re-executed.
.. @+node:ekr.20100112051224.6238: *6* Some commands do not work in headline
Leo functions exist which unconditionally set focus to the body pane
regardless of the active pane.

For example, bracket matching commands ("%" key) do not work within
a node's headline text.  Instead, the command is performed on the
node's body text.

Using the "undo" command (key 'u') to undo a change to a node's headline text
only works correctly after another node has been selected. It appears that
changes made to a node's headline text are not recorded in Leo's change history
until the edited node has lost focus.
.. @+node:ekr.20100112051224.6222: *6* Commands requesting user input
Commands requesting user input must be the last command executed within an @mode
node. This prevents the implementation of commands such as "yank to <character>"
that requires a "copy to clipboard" operation after the "find-character"
command.

======

Maybe we just need more commands...
.. @+node:ekr.20100112051224.6223: *6* Editing node headlines using @mode nodes
Commands modifying or selecting headline text do not work correctly within a
@mode node.

This eliminates accurate implementation of vi's delete/change/substitute/yank
object commands. As a workaround, the commands are currently written to only
select the text. The user must perform the subsequent delete, change,
substitute, and yank.

.. @+node:ekr.20110202094848.12568: *7* Named marks
Another is named marks, in Vim you can store a number of cursor
locations, and recall them to jump around in your code.  This was also
useful in filling out templates as each stop could be given a name
mark.  This helped make filling out a template easier as you weren't
stuck in a linear filling in the blanks in a set order, template stops
where linked in rings, you could jump from the last stop back to the
first and make and changes you wanted on a second go round.  Gravity
of marks made things easier to inspect to determine what stops where
used and which ones were being bypassed.

As these things had an actual presence in the text buffer, it going to
be a little harder to come up with a reasonable work around.

.. @+node:ekr.20100112051224.6236: *7* Two kinds of words
Vi supports two types of words in its commands:

1. Words that consist of only a subset of the character set and
2. words that consist of all characters except the space and tab characters.

Leo's always considers a word to consist of a subset of characters
although some word related commands include different characters
than others.
.. @+node:ekr.20090629183608.8446: *7* Copy/paste/yank/delete
Yank vs. Yank:
Vi's "yank" commands copy the selected text TO the clipboard.
Leo's "yank" commands insert text FROM the clipboard.

copy-text in modes:
Leo's copy-text command does not work within a mode.  As a result,
all "copy to clipboard" capability is being implemented using the
kill-<object> command followed by Leo's "yank" command to put the
text back.

paste-text in modes:
The paste-text command does not work within an @mode node.  Leo's
"yank" command is used instead.

delete-node does not copy node to clipboard:
A copy-node command is issued to copy the node to the clipboard
followed by the delete-node command.

@nocolor-node

From Tom L

This is hardwired for the first parameter.  Things I need to expand
this:

1. put in a variable that cycles through the tabStops

2. In this mock up, you are entering the parameters in the minibuffer,
a more advanced version would collect each keypress and put it in the
body at the current tabStop, a tab would finalize the entry and
advance to the next stop, no text other than the 'help', ends up in
the minibuffer.

Sinc I'm only modifying existing code without real understanding of
what Leo is doing, any guidance would be appreciated.

By: ktenney

Zope3, with it's component based architecture,
has machinery which hooks components together ..
Interfaces, Adapters and ZCML, the configuration
language.

It sounds like the autocompleter code is able
to build indexes of classes and methods. It would
be cool if that capability could be extensible,
allowing building indexes of the couplings between
components.

I think this might look like some kind of automatic
hyperlinking, providing access to related code,
as defined for that application.

I really don't know if this makes sense, but
I see you moving in the direction of making Leo
capable of doing some _explaining_ of the code 
being written.

.. @+node:ekr.20111216105907.10218: *6* My response: this is a wishlist item
@nocolor-node

Reposted from http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/67a28984616d09c9
About bug 882243: clones sometimes not saved

I'd like to discuss this bug here, because I would like us all to be aware of the situation, and possible changes.

The surprise
=========

To paraphrase the original bug report, suppose we have the following @file tree:

+ @file test.txt
@others
  + node 1 (cloned)
    node 1 text.
  + node 2
     @others
    + node 1 (cloned)
       node 1 text.

As usual, lines preceded by "+" denote headlines: all other lines are body text.

The surprise is that the cloned node1 node is written to the external file only once (as a child of the root node) and hence does not appear as a (cloned) child of the node2 node when Leo next loads the @file tree.

History
=====

I would like to call this a wishlist item because the
present code quite intentionally writes *any* node
(including cloned nodes) only once. That is, the write code
sets a bit when writing a node, and @others ignores any
nodes with that bit set.

You could call this a bug in the @others write logic, but at
one time it was done explicitly and on purpose.

I don't remember why this was so, but I do remember it *was*
so. It may have been an artifact of Leo's old representation
of clones that used both vnodes and tnodes. tnodes no longer
exist in the one-node world that we have been living in for
several years, and it may well be time to revisit the
original design, but I would rather not do that just now
because there are several "real" bugs that need attention
asap.

Workaround
=========

Because this is an issue involving @others, you might assume
that a workaround involving sections would be possible. You
would be correct. The following file works as expected::

+ @file test.txt
<< node 1 >>
<< node 2 >>
  + << node 1>> (cloned)
     node 1 text.
  + << node 2 >>
     << node 1 >>
    + << node 1 >>(cloned)
       node 1 text.

One feature I have not seen in SCS system is something which might be called
"history compression": I might be interested in having both version 5 and 6
in my source tree, when the current version is 7, but I am not really interested
in the 2000 steps which transformed 5 into 6 (just suggested this feature to
the bazaar people). This happens actually quite often to me, since I use the
SCS as a back-up system, saving many (uninteresting) intermediate steps while
implementing a new feature.

.. @+node:ekr.20100209160132.5770: *5* cache notes
Top-level folder are direct subfolders of .leo/db.
Top-level folders represent file *locations* not file contents.
Exception: the top-level "globals" folder represents minor data.

Only two files are ever needed in a top-level folder:

contents_<key>: the contents of the file.
data_<key>: a dict representing the "minor data" of the file:
    <globals> element stuff, expansion bits, etc.

We write contents_<key> only once.
By definition, its contents never changes, since the contents generates the key.
We can write data_<key> as many times as we like.

To do:
- Simplify or even eliminate the path-manipulation code in PickleShareDB.
- Use g.makeAllNonExistentDirectories to make top-level directories.
- Clear cache should clear all top-level directories.

1. Memory does leak, and that's not ok with me.  And I want just two
files per top-level directory.

2. Strange things can happen with caching, as just happened to me when
I restored qtui_generate.py mistakenly deleted from leo/test.  There
is an @auto node for this file in qtGui.py, and I got improper 'can
not open' messages for this file.

3. It is troubling that the present caching scheme does not use the
full path to a file, only the basename.  This means that two identical
files in two different places will use the same cache entries.  I've
been wondering for the last several days about whether this could
cause problems.  I don't know for sure, but I am uncomfortable.

4. I want the clear-cache and clear-all-caches commands to do what
they say: get rid of everything.  Among other things, this is good for
debugging and recovering from cache problems.

This is a recent bug, but imo it has uncovered some other caching buglets. These
buglets are not big enough to delay Leo 4.7, but the new caching scheme would
ensure they never bite.

1. The code that computes what I have been calling the top-level directory is dubious::

    dbdirname = join(g.app.homeLeoDir,'db',
            '%s_%s' % (bname,hashlib.md5(fn).hexdigest()))

The problem is that bname is only the base name of the cached file, not a name
(or key) that depends on the full path. Thus, two copies of the same file in the
same place will be cached in the same directory. Is this ominous?

2. It's not clear what caching to do with the save-to command.

@nocolor

The main difficulty I see in the migration is creating the tables in the getPublicCommands methods in the various classes in leoEditCommands.py.  At present, these tables associate command names (strings) with corresponding methods.  The form of getPublicCommands is always:

def getPublicCommands (self):
  return {
    'command-name1': self.methodName1,
    'command-name2': self.methodName2,
    ...
  }

Thinking out loud, let's see whether the migration can be done easily.  We would change the entry:

    'command-name1': self.methodNameN,

to:

    'command-name1': self.classNameN(self),

That is, the table creates an instance of the class by calling the class's ctor, with self (the container object) as the ctor's only argument.  To make this work, all we need to do is give the class a __call__ method whose signature matches the signature of methodNameN, that is, the signature used to call methods previously.

Well, isn't this nice.  We can transition gradually, as needed.  No need *ever* to do a mass migration.  It should be easy to verify this scheme with one or two examples.  Please report your experiences if you decide to play around with this.

Edward

P.S.  I think it would be good style to append "Class" to the name of each command class. This makes it clear that self.myCommandClass(self) is a ctor.

What uA should be used to specify node colors?

if the foreground / background color API uses uAs,
would/should the uAs use the reserved "leo_&lt;something&gt;"
namespace?

-------------------

Terry Brown

Sounds like something I may have brought up, long ago.

I was thinking that setting the fore/background color of nodes in the
tree should be a "gui core" function, and that the info should be
stored in uA, and so wanted to know what key should be used in uA for
that.  I think the docs say top level keys starting with "leo_" are
reserved, and probably wanted a ruling on

v.u['leo_fg'] = 'red'

vs

v.u['leo_tree_style']['fg'] = 'red'

etc.

I think the question may be more complicated than just what to call the
key, so you can probably retire the todo item.

A reminder, the opposite of "light" is "heavy", not "dark" :-)

Leo's print-settings, print-commands and print-bindings commands
create too much text.

Suppose they created outline nodes instead, replacing existing nodes
if they exist.  Something like this:

- Reference (Anywhere you like)
 - @print-settings
    etc.
 - @print-bindings
   etc
 - @print commands
   etc

Doh!  This uses Leo's power.  The subnodes can be as voluminous as
desired, and there can be organizer nodes in each case.  The actual
tree could be specified as in @menus.

Etc., etc.  This could moot the need for separate apropos commands.
Conversely, apropos commands could create their own trees, or
subtrees.

This could be the tip of an iceberg.

The more I think about the light/heavy distinction, the more I think
it is getting close to what makes Leo special.  For example, clones
(and nodes, for that matter) drastically lighten the apparent
complexity of programs or data.

Leo has to have this :-)  It's on my list.  It would be a great way to
find @button nodes.

Furthermore, global searches for attributes in docstrings have
immediate uses.

On the urgent to-do list: drive all aspects of the Nav pane using
keystrokes.

I just reviewed @bookmarks--it's perfect for leo.leo.  The following
would replace all.bat:

- @bookmarks
  - leoPy.leo (url in body)
  - leoPlugins.leo
  - leoSettings.leo
  - myLeoSettings.leo
  - leoDocs.leo
  - leoDist.leo
  - scripts.leo

This way could be said to be much better than all.bat: nothing gets
loaded until needed.  Therefore, even more files could be added.

Imo, URL's in bookmark trees should support {{expression}} notations.

For example, I want the following to work in the body text of a node
in an @bookmarks tree::

file://{{g.os_path_finalize_join(g.app.loadDir,'..','doc','LeoDocs.leo').replace('\\','/')}}

Not bad, eh?  Or maybe the URL logic should do the replace('\\','/')
automatically...

Got to go.  We are nearing a tipping point in Leo's workflow...

In the multifile plugin there is an option to insert a directory string.  I
use it alot for the @path directive.  What happens is that when executed a FileDialog
opens up and the user selects the directory he wants to use as a directory string.
When chosen the directory string is inserted into the text editor.

The good of this:
1. It makes using path simpler, you dont have to type out the directory path
yourself, just use the tkFileDialog to select it and have Leo insert the string.
For long directories this saves a lot of typing.

simple, short and quite helpful.  Thoughts? :)

Leo's file format: version 3, draft 5

This draft is intended to reflect minimal changes from Leo's
present file format, but with improvements mentioned at the
Ashland sprint and developed afterward.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted
for use as a json file format.

This draft contains significant invention by EKR. See the next
section. Don't panic: it can be changed :-)

Summary of changes from draft 4
===============================

- Elements will be renamed as follows::

    old         new
    ====        ====
    <vnodes>    <directed-acyclic-graph>
    <tnodes>    <data-list>
    <v>         <node>
    <t>         <data>

- Nesting of <node> elements represents the structure of the DAG,
  just as nesting of <v> elements does at present.
  
- Thus, there will be no <edge> elements.

- Headlines will move from <v> elements to <data> elements.
  This "normalizes" the data: headlines will appear only once.
  
- <attr> elements will represent uA's.  A full discussion below.

  Ideally, I would like to support only string and json formats
  for <attr> elements.  This is open to discussion. 

- Only <node> elements will contain <attr> elements.

- <node> elements for @file nodes will contain
  <at-file-attributes> elements, representing Leo's "hidden
  machinery" attributes.  <at-file-attributes> will contain
  <attr> elements. 

First lines
===========

Leo file will start with the following::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo (http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html) -->
    <leo_file file_format="3"
        xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
        

No session data
===============

There will be no <globals>, <preferences> or
<find_panel_settings> elements. All such "session data" will be
restored from the cache, or from defaults if caching is disabled.

**Important**: there is no representation of expansion state or
the currently selected node anywhere in the .leo file.
Eliminating these data is contingent on having Leo work well with
caching disabled.

Note: marks are more than session data. They must appear within
<node> elements.


Summary of format
=================

.leo files will have the following form, with similar indentation::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo (http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html) -->
    <leo_file file_format="3" xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
    <directed-acyclic-graph>
        <node id="gnx">
            <!-- contained node elements, if any.
        </node>
        <node id="gnx">
            <!-- contained v elements, if any.
        </node>
        ...
    </directed-acyclic-graph>
    <data-list>
        <data id="gnx">
            <!-- marked attribute appears only if the tnode/vnode is marked -->
            <head>headline text</head>
            <attr key="marked">1</attr>
            <!-- uA's... -->
            <!-- format="string" is the default -->
            <attr key="a">a string</attr>
            <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
            <attr key="c" format="pickle">a pickled string</attr>
            <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
            ...
            <body>body text</body>
        </data>
        ...
    </data-list>
    </leo_file>

<attr> elements
===============

<attr> elements will one of the following forms::

    <attr key="a">a unicode string</attr>
    <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="c" format="pickle">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
    
The value will be a string by default.

If possible, I would like to support only the string and json
formats. This would make the data as transparent as possible.
Please mentally amend the following discussion...

uA's that start with "binhex_" will use the binhex format. This
prefix must be retained in the type field, so the read code can
restore them.

If the value is not a string, and there is no "binhex_" prefix,
the write code will use format="json" if json.dumps succeeds, and
will use format="pickle" otherwise.

No <attr> element will be written if both json.dumps and
pickle.dumps fail. Attribute failures will create a warning for
the plugin developer.
    
Descendant attributes in @file trees
====================================

Descendants of @file nodes do not appear in .leo files. Thus,
important data must be stored in the so-called hidden machinery:
attributes of the @file node.

The <at-file-attributes> element may optionally be contained in
the <node> element for @file nodes::

    <at-file-attributes>
        <attr>key="ua-name"
            format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"
            gnx="gnx">value
        </attr>

Leo's file format: version 3, draft 4

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/a2b7e5321d62b64/a4cc51d404af94aa

Here is the latest version, with the graphml stuff removed.

This draft is intended to reflect our recent discussions, with no
new invention from me. All comments and corrections welcome.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted
for use as a json file format.

Recent changes
==============

- Removed graphml stuff, including leo: prefixes.

- Used "key" in <attr> elements (and "type" in <edge> elements.)

First lines
===========

Leo file will start with the following::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>

        ...
    </edges>
    </graph>
    </leo_file>

<attr> elements
===============

<attr> elements will one of the following forms::

    <attr key="a">a unicode string</attr>
    <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="c" format="pickle">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
    
That is, the value will be a string by default.

uA's that start with "binhex_" will use the binhex format. This
prefix must be retained in the type field, so the read code can

the write code will use format="json" if json.dumps succeeds, and
will use format="pickle" otherwise.

No <attr> element will be written if both json.dumps and
pickle.dumps fail. Attribute failures will create a warning for
the plugin developer.

<edge> elements
===============

<edge> elements will have the form::

    <edge type="child" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Leo will use type="child" to represent Leo's official edges.
Plugins are free to define any type except "child". Examples::

    <edge type="undirected" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="bidirectional" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="backlink" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="myPlugin" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Descendant attributes in @file trees
====================================

Descendants of @file nodes do not appear in .leo files. Thus,
important data must be stored in the so-called hidden machinery:
attributes of the @file node.

The <at-file-attributes> element may be contained in the
<node> element for @file nodes::

    <at-file-attributes>
        <attr>key="ua-name"
            format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"
            gnx="gnx">value
        </attr>
        ...
    </at-file-attributes>
    
In other words, we use the graphml <attr> element, extended with the
gnx attribute, to represent all the uA's in the descendants of @file nodes.

This draft is intended to reflect our recent discussions, with no

The draft is also intended to be compatible with graphml.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted
for use as a json file format.

I am willing to change "type" to "key" in <edge> elements if that
would be preferable.

Recent changes
==============

- Added <graphml> element defining the default namespace.

- Defined the leo namespace for leo-only elements.
    - Renamed <leo_file> to <leo:outline>
    - Renamed <descendant-attributes> to <leo:at-file-attributes>

- Used <leo:at-file-attributes> for marks, removing the special case.

- Enclosed <leo:descendant-attributes> in a (graphml) <data> element.

- Changed the format of the "marked" attribute to be a string-valued attribute.

If the value is not a string, and there is no "binhex_" prefix,
the write code will use format="json" if json.dumps succeeds, and
will use format="pickle" otherwise.

No <attr> element will be written if both json.dumps and
pickle.dumps fail. Attribute failures will create a warning for
the plugin developer.

<edge> elements
===============

<edge> elements will have the form::

    <edge type="child" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Leo will use type="child" to represent Leo's official edges.
Plugins are free to define any type except "child". Examples::

    <edge type="undirected" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="bidirectional" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="backlink" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="myPlugin" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Descendant attributes in @file trees
====================================

Descendants of @file nodes do not appear in .leo files. Thus,
important data must be stored in the so-called hidden machinery:
attributes of the @file node.

The <leo:at-file-attributes> element may be contained in the
<node> element for @file nodes. For compatibility with graphml,
it will enclosed in a data element::
    
    <data>
        <leo:at-file-attributes>
            <attr>key="ua-name"
                format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"
                gnx="gnx">value
            </attr>
            ...
        </leo:at-file-attributes>
    </data>
    
In other words, we use the graphml <attr> element, extended with the
gnx attribute, to represent all the uA's in the descendants of @file nodes.

It requires a translation layer, either to (un)munge the name or
(un)pickle. Real problem?

Let's say each time I think 'I can use UAs to store that' I change
my mind when I realize my values will be in a pickle. (I really don't
want to name all my attributes str_xxx)

How is it done in any other XML file?
I've not used XML for arbitrary data, but it probably can be done.

> Why would that way be better than pickle?

My suspicion is that UAs would be used more for
storing text and numbers (as seems common for XML files)
than Python data objects.

Does Leo use UAs to store pickles?

I'm sure pickling capability is great, but I'm not convinced
it should be the _default._

No big deal.

Other options I though would be really handy:

1. Use an existing node as a source also

2. Use an node from another Leo file.. I am not sure what the syntax for that
would be exactly

3. From a URL.. this would be really cool. People could post outlines not only
as existing Leo xml files, but as text files or even dynamic scripts. The code
to handle these would presumably need to deal with http:// intelligently. But
that's easy in Python. Rebol is great at that too.

4. Other XML file with valid filepaths in them.
That's probably a much bigger project like Leo 3.10

@nocolor
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3583737
By: Offray

I was previously thinking in the relation between Leo and Wikis, and I think
that may be a thing that would help to make Leo more visible in Wiki space could
be if Leo can export/import to/from a Wiki (something limilar to th @file or
@url directives). Let me explain a little better the scenary where this idea
come.

We have a local wiki for colombian Free Software Community related issues, and
I have used Leo for writing the migration scripts from Mediawiki to MoinMoin
(wich I think is more flexible and extensible that the popular wiki behind
wikipedia). I was probing also the idea of a Wiki like environment for solving
colaborative problems, so I was posting the scripts I made on Leo in a Wiki
page, and republishing them in the moment they changed. This keeps me pasting
all the time the script and in some moments I was thinking what about if someone
make a change in the Wiki page. Would be nice then to have the same capability
to detect and sincronize that change as Leo make with the hard disk files.

But this doesnt end here. Another Wiki-Leo interaction is to use outlines as
a way to organice Wiki content. For example "= Title =" in a Wiki would be a
Outline Node in Leo and "== Subtitle ==" Would become a outline subnode all
arranged in the proper hierarchy.

Somekind of Wisiwyg display would be nice, but this must be a plugin or something
like that, so Leo could become a "Layered" front end to some kind of data.

About and article on Wikipedia. That would be nice, but I'm a little tired of
fighting with some wikipedians ignorance on certain matters combined with power
(a pretty bad combination). I think that a Wiki page is nice because its live
comes from the community knowledge, but I'm not interested in that fighting,
so I have made a Leo wiki page in our local Wiki:

http://www.el-directorio.org:8080/Leo

and when I have enough knowledge about Leo (and time) I hope to start making
contribs in the spanish documentation (for the moment I'm only workind in the
evangelism here).

moot as it will be with the new config options

maybe there is a single point to involke clear 
undo that could be run from a button?

with py2.3 after allot of small edits on an open leo after a few hours gc can
hit unexpectedly and last several minutes
and return at any time lasting several more minutes.
I think its gc related because the memory use and disk grinding demanding I
free up memory or kill python.

I have no idea if undo is the cause,
 just guessing.
using cvs of last week. I just updated, 
will let you know if it happens again.
(new error reporting jump to error is great)

usually I don't edit in the same process that long.
I have run scripts from leo that run 6, 12 
or 24 hours no problem. 
maybe I can turn on some internals reporting and
get some feedback on whats going on from python if it happens again. 
or run the gc script before and after.

 win98 128meg w/maxmem memory defrager that works well.
but I go from 50% free to 10% when this starts happening.
I haven't noticed this problem yet in py2.4, and it is peppier,
but don't use py2.4 enough. it doesn't happen every day.
I reboot at least once a day for various reasons.
so it isn't that either. 
you do need to reboot and or exit python once it starts.
this was never an issue with py2.2 and Leo 4.1 or less with only 64 megs.
I don't really have any other long running python processes to compare to Leo. 
can't say what it is.
Aha, progress. 
this started sometime early in 4.2 or late 4.1
but I can still be persuaded something in my 
local system is to blame, some install or dll update. or script, psyco or plugin
related.

nonwithstanding, I should be taking better advantage Moore's law in my CPU and
memory.
I only notice this when I'm running the same leo over a few hours of constant
editing and running scrips.
and when I exit python and restart leo everything returns to normal.
more a supporting anomaly report 
than a bug report or feature request.

-- pdf -- 
yes I know what you mean, PDF has it uses.  If nicely embedded into Leo via
'reportwriter'  and some export scripts {and clear useinterfance} would stillbe
a good thing.


As I start to think about how to print Leo, I become more aware of the differneces
between Leo structures and linear [print] layouts.

Different kinds of outlines obviously will need different kinds of printing.
I don't yet have enough experience or overview.

--xslt--
Seems a natural way to go for printing Leo, but yet another langauge and syntax
to wrassle with. Last time I looked I went from being horrified to very impressed
to be being exhausted.

--htmlize--
thanks I'll check into that

"print to web"  should definitely be on Leo's missing PRINT MENU.

--swf [flash]--
This printing topic pushes me harder to get FLC  [my FlashLeoClient project]
into the Leosphere.

Flash has*limited*  CSS handling, but enough to do some nice and useful typographic
formatting in a pretty clean object-oriented manner.

FLC parses .leo files into a Flash object. Flash Textformat instances are created
using CSS and can be applied then to rendering any parts of  the deserialized
Leo object.. The beauty is it can be very fast and ynamic so I can imagine a
real-time WYSIWYG laytou tool for printing Leo to web and at the same making
it suitable at the same time for print-to-paper.

Since FLC is in the very first instance a READ-ONLY client tool for Leo, it
makes it a natural Leo printing service.

To complete full service, it woudl be good if Leo could create SWF files directly
itself, just like using PDF reportwriter.
There are a couple of libraries to help this 
- Ming [with PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby wrappers]
http://ming.sourceforge.net/

- makeswf.r [interesting REBOL/Flash dialect by David Oldes]
http://sweb.cz/oliva.david/swf/

These could also be both configured as web-services.
So Leo print-to-web would include by default rendering a flash swf file versoin
of itself either using locally installed libraries or by passing a view of itself
to a chosen client or server-based tool.

But even without those extra 'services' and libraries a single flash file in
the form of FLC could become an effective Leo printing kit. Using a standalone
desktop  version [not embedded in the browser, out of the sandbox] much more
is possible - remote control, peer-peer editing, file writing etc.

-- flashpaper2--
btw, Lately I've been using Flashpaper2 a lot to print all kinds of stuff, Often
from web pages to my local adhoc home filebase. It's a very fast lighweight
alternative to PDF, saves paper, has excellent zooming and nice search features
built-in.
Flashpaper renders a very litteral snapshot, but as I am discovering that turns
out to be extremely useful.
For example you visit a page and click on some links. Flashpaper saves teh pages
exactly as it looks, viisted links disntinguished.  In the era of info-overload,
even that crude mnemonic is valuable.

Alas, Flashpaper2 is not free nor open in the way Leo is. But worth to play
with it if only for for the experience.
30 day trial downlaod from
http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashpaper/

And of course the flash _players_ is free, so can send people flashpaper documents
just like PDF.
Brilliant when you have a big Excel spreadsheet or CAD document which would
normally get all messy printing across pages, confusing people.
Instead adjust and print to a generous 'piece' of flashpaper - letting your
coleagues pan and zoom to their comfort.

I've not quite figured out the place where  Leo meets Flashpaper, because Leo
needs to preserve its full pane contents. Flashpaper works fine with long web
pages, automatically reading the full window contents and cutting into a paginated
sequence, ready for paper printing.
Leo's does not have aprint menu, so it's off the sytem's print-devices map,
which Flash paper appearing just  like any phtycial printer.

I imagine is possible to fix that in Leo, but I do not where to begin and woudl
not be surprised to learn its a major heachche to write adn debug for multiple
operating systems.

An immediate alternative are screencapture tools like vnc2swf or MDM Capture.

[vnc2swf uses Ming-0.2a]
http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/

http://www.multidmedia.com/software/capture/index.php

But much is hidden or lost from view. 
Still very vauable for creating dynamic narrative tutorials [aka screencasting]

AS you know I am very excited about what flash can do for Leo, and vice versa.
But I am concerned that there is not yet a 100% Leo means which supports people's
standard print needs and habits.

-- PRINT MENU-- 
Leo deserves good friendly printing features which anyone can use. At the moment
we have a confusing patchwork of choices. Printing Leo seems to be both harder
and easier than  first meets the eye.

Having a little library of export scripts - well named, documented and intended
to aid printing woudl go a long way. Thesse scripts anyone coiuld be called
by onayone given a Leo Outline, accessing a navabr button. PRINT MENU or list.
Or they can just insert the appropriate script  into an outline giving finer
grained print control on the fly.

Proposal: modify the code for @url so that if you type for example just "@url"
(no file specified) in a headline, a window pops up allowing you to browse the
local file system and select the file (similar to what browsers do when you
want to open a file).

This would be more convenient than manually writing @url
file://a/long/path/to/the/file. @read-only nodes already allow this, it would

I don't know if this is relevant or not, but the IPython autocompletion
capability is awesome.

If I'm investigating code I tend to do the following.

list the modules in a package:
In [1]: from fs import <tab>

this lists the modules, in a package so I pick one
In [1]: from fs import osfs
<the osfs entry is tab-completable>

now I can check the usage of fs.osfs
In [2]: osfs? <enter>

or the source:
In [2]: osfs?? <enter>

or the contents of the module
In [2]: osfs. <tab>

I can instantiate a class:
In [3]: myfs = osfs.OSFS('/')

and examine the ivars and methods:
In [4]: myfs. <tab>

It is such an efficient way to learn and remember the details of code.

I know a bunch of work was done on Leo/IPython integration, don't
know the current status, my wish of synchronized IPython and Leo
may well be one of the many granted wishes I have forgotten about.

I certainly think IPython autocompletion is the gold standard.

Hate to break into the grand design discussions, but here's a hopefully small thing. If you need to place a good sized copyright statement at the top of your files, LEO doesn't handle this case very cleanly. As I'm sure you're aware, you wind up with a matching number of @@first lines for each leading line in your source.

My fellow co-workers who don't use LEO, aren't exactly loving me here. 

Might we introduce an:

Type tag instead? So one '@@first 5' could represent all 5 of the above @@first lines? It makes for a smaller, cleaner LEO footprint and will tick off non-LEO users much less.

RE: Haskell support

There's a literate programming mode in Haskell (and in a number of other
functional programming languages such as Clean & Curry), where the program is in
a comment, usually where the line starts with ">" (bird track style, I think
it's called), and the comments/documentation are freeform. It would be difficult
but cool if Leo could support it, if only because the sentinels in the derived
files wouldn't make whole file look so busy.

I will wait. Here's clarification, when you're ready for it:

All of my projects are stored on remote computers, and accessed via FTP. 
What I want is basically the ability to open up these projects directly 
through leo, instead of transferring the files manually between my computer 
and the computers that hold my projects, preferably through FTP.

My solution: A new menu item called 'FTP' or 'Remote'. Click on this, and an 
FTP dialog opens up, with an empty list of FTP sites, and the ability to add 
more. You select a site, and it brings up a list of files. You select a 
file, and it is added to your project. When you hit 'save', it automatically 
does an FTP send.

Python makes this a lot easier with the builtin module 'ftplib'. I'm sure 
there are similar things for C++. I hope you take this idea into 
consideration.

Thanks for all these comments.  I'll respond to them all here.

Clearly, we should be using a standard xml parser to read .leo files.

My present thoughts:

- I personally like human-readable headlines in <v> elements.

- I am open to putting headlines in <t> elements, as an indication that
tnodes do indeed contain headlines and body text.

- I am willing to consider only writing shared subtrees once.

Oh! (An Aha)  All these are preferences.  We can allow any combination of
these provided that headlines appear somewhere.

So that's clean.  This will happen in Leo 4.5.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/eb718b4c6d478ac0

I'm just getting started learning how to use Leo. Now, I'd like to use
it for some of my projects, but there's no chance that I can convert
everyone at work to using it, so putting sentinel-filled files in our
repository is out of the question. At the same time, my code looks
awfully bare without sentinels because the documentation ends up in
the section names, not the comments!

So, I was wondering if there's a convenient way to pull the section
names into a comment at the start of each section?

===============

Interesting question.  Am I correct in assuming you are using @nosent trees
to generate your files?  If so, it would be easy to add support for the
following options:

@bool write_section_comments_in_at_nosent_trees
@bool write_node_name_comments_in_at_nosent_trees

The first would write a sentinel consisting of only the section name;
the second would write a sentinel consisting only of the node's headline
(for nodes whose headline is not a section name).

These seem like they would be useful additions.  One can even imagine
corresponding Leo directives so that the comments could be turned on or off
within an @nosent tree.

What do you think?

That sounds like an excellent solution. Particularly the last bit --
if you could turn section-comments on and off as required, it would
become very convenient to use Leo to produce source that is intended
to also be read by non Leo users.

@ This loop writes all output lines using a single writer:
new_private_lines_wtr.

The output lines come from two, and *only* two readers:

1. old_private_lines_rdr delivers the complete original sources. All
   sentinels and unchanged regular lines come from this reader.

2. new_public_lines_rdr delivers the new, changed sources. All inserted or
   replacement text comes from this reader.

Each time through the loop, the following are true:

- old_i is the index into old_public_lines of the start of the present
  SequenceMatcher opcode.

- mapping[old_i] is the index into old_private_lines of the start of
  the same opcode.

At the start of the loop, the call to copy_sentinels effectively skips
(deletes) all previously unwritten non-sentinel lines in
old_private_lines_rdr whose index is less than mapping[old_i].

As a result, the opcode handlers do not need to delete elements from
the old_private_lines_rdr explicitly. This explains why opcode
handlers for the 'insert' and 'delete' opcodes are identical.

Thanks for this report. I think it is important, and needs a good solution.

I dislike all these files being sprayed around the file system. I'd like to see
these files placed somewhere the ~/.leo directory. Is there a reason why this
would be a bad idea?

Similarly, we might also prefer to have shadow files place in, say,
~/.leo/shadow_files.

In both cases, I think we want to create files that indicate their location.
Either that, or mirror their location in (subdirectories) ~/.leo. In other
words, this is a general problem, and it would be good to have a robust, general
solution.

I think there could be quite a bit of interest in moving
the shadow files to their own tree, avoiding what might
be considered 'pollution' of a tree of files in @shadow nodes.

Edward has said that this would add a lot of complexity to Leo.

It seems that a VCS back end for Leo might simplify the
task of arbitrary shadow file location, as well as adding
versioning capability.

      fileDir = g.os_path_dirname(filename)

=>   if self.shadow_in_home_dir:
        fileDir = "//".join([baseDir, fileDir.replace(':','%')])

In this way I keep .leo_shadow dirs in a tree and it is ok if the user
reorgs the original tree.

=====================
Edward K. Ream
 to bogomil

Thanks for these suggestions.  I'll try them soon.

A few minor comments about the code.

>  self.shadow_in_home_dir = c.config.getBool('shadow_in_home_dir') or False

This works (because c.config.getBool returns None if the setting does
not exist). Thus, the "or False" part merely replaces None by False.
I prefer the following:

self.shadow_in_home_dir = c.config.getBool('shadow_in_home_dir',default=False)

>   if self.shadow_in_home_dir:
>         fileDir = "//".join([baseDir, fileDir.replace(':','%')])

This looks like a Windows-only solution because of ':'.  It might fail
in strange ways on other platforms.

I noticed that when the renderpane is active it is not affected by the
Window>Equal Sized Panes command. Only the Outline and Body Panes are affected -
just as described in
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/outlines.html#resizing-panes. However from
the user perspective the current behaviour appears as though the command is only
partially successful. Since there are specific commands to contract/expand the
log pane, shouldn't the log and render panes also be affected by the
Window>Equal Sized Panes command?


I suppose so.  I would prefer to wait for Terry to finish his
pane-generalization code before dealing with this.

@nocolor-node

tab-cycle-next makes the following not so important

There is a relationship here with mouseless
programming.  It would seem that all visual elements, especially those
that may exist in multiple versions, must have a name or other
description suitable for generalized commands.

The user might want multiple rendering panes, especially if
one or more are locked.  Without a description, there is no way to
specify exactly what show/hide-rendering pane does.

I haven't forgotten the autocompleter docs.  I'll get to them next.
It looks like autocompletion would be the way to generalize the not-
very-effect commands that switch focus from one ui element to
another.  A related benefit is one generalized command might be more
convenient to use than the present flavors of (buggy) cycle-focus
commands.

In short, contemplating generalized windows leads us to generalized
select/delete/show/hide commands, based on autocompletion, that work
on various ui elements.  This looks like the next project.

I've some more information about the problems with accent previously
reported:
- I can confirm that they are caused by the interaction scim+leo (with
and without the qt plugin). If scim is not started leo works fine. If
scim is running the problems appear and are slightly different with
and without the qt plugin. The workaround is obvious: don't use leo
and scim at the same time :-)
- accents are not working in the qt plugin when scintilla is used. If
qt-use-scintilla=False I can write this:

àáä (the same for the rest of vowels)

but if qt-use-scintilla=True when I enter the same sequence in the
keyboard I get:

`aaa (the same for the rest of vowels)

- the problem with the ñ character (reported previously too) is only
present in the qt plugin (both with and without scintilla)

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3064212
By: djsg

The following applies to Leo 4.3, which is in alpha as I write this. It describes
the LeoSetup routine that I submitted to Edward to solve the "can't find Python"
problem, and which Edward cleaned up for distribution.

I think a few further issues need attention. I noticed them while working on
the "can't find Python" problem, and deferred dealing with them. This appears
to me to be a good time to pick them up.

Before I start work on them, I would like to lay them out for your comment.
Are they pains in the first place? Are my proposals good enough, and do they
make sense?

Issue 1. LeoSetup still thinks Leo's user is an Administrator who owns the whole
machine.

For explanation, let's say that I log on as David to Windows 2000 or Windows
XP and install Leo 4.3. You then log out. You log in as Edward, and click Start,
pick Programs... you have no visible entry for Leo!

The current Setup routine allows no one but David to use Leo on this computer.
To make things worse, when I go to use Leo, I have to log in to Windows using
the account under which I installed it, which has Administrator rights to the
computer. In other words, I can't use Leo without operating the computer in
a mode that leaves it needlessly vulnerable to security violations.

Issue 2. LeoSetup allows only one copy of Leo on a given computer. 

LeoSetup assumes that you want Leo in C:\Program Files\Leo. The installer can
override that already. LeoSetup also goes to some trouble to set up the usual
click-to-open behavior for .leo files. That behavior is tied to the copy of
Python that was current when I ran LeoSetup, and tied to the copy of Leo that
was installed most recently.

Proposal: While LeoSetup should allow all accounts to share the Python code
for core Leo and its plug-ins, my guess is that we don't want to enforce that,
since Leo is a programmer's tool and the individual programmer will wish to
modify Leo and its pieces for the programmer's use.

Proposal Option 1. Setup should ask whether to install Leo for everyone or for
the installer's account only. If the answer to that question is "yes," Setup
should give the user a private copy of everything that comes with Leo -- the
only application shared should be the current Python, assuming that it is installed
for all users.

Python.org's installer for Python 2.4 allows the installed Python to work only
for the account that installed it. I found this in December and wrote code to
handle it, which I then commented out since the issue wasn't critical. I can
check a computer with a single-account installation of Python in order to figure
out how a single-account installation of Leo would have to handle the click-to-open
behavior.

Proposal Option 2. When LeoSetup finds Python installed for that single user,
it should ask whether to install Leo for the installer's account only. If the
answer to that question is "yes," Setup should give the user a private copy
of everything that comes with Leo and use the single-user installation of Python.
Why does this matter. If you need to test your plug-ins with different versions
of Python, this would make that easier.

Issue 3. LeoSetup always installs Python MegaWidgets ("Pmw"), even on computers
whose installed Python installation already includes it.

Proposal: put up a dialog box and ask whether Setup should install Pmw  I do
not know whether doing this is a good idea.

Issue 4. LeoSetup does not run without human intervention. This complicates
deploying Leo in multi-computer sites.

The message box that displays the path of the Python installation found is one
issue. I put it in to allow the installer to cross-check Setup's behavior. Since
nobody has complained about problems with the code I wrote to fix the problem
installing with Python 2.4 and Active Python, Setup need no longer force the
installer to review the message box's contents.

Proposal: The message box needs to time out after, say, 15 seconds. 

I last looked at the installer three months ago so I would have to look at the
rest of it for other barriers to automated installation.

Let me know what you think. I won't be able to start work for a week or so,
so there's no rush.

@language rest

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/b5c2982778a2df53

Provides commands (Alt-x) for importing and exporting XML from a Leo
outline. These commands are to XML what ``@auto-rst`` is to
reStructuredText.

``xml2leo`` imports an .xml file into the node following the currently
selected node.  ``leo2xml`` exports the current subtree to an .xml file
the user selects.

``xml_validate``, if executed on the top node in the
Leo xml tree, reports any errors in XML generation or DTD validation,
based on the DTD referenced from the XML itself.  If there's no DTD
it reports that as an error.

``leo2xml2leo`` takes the selected Leo subtree representing an XML file,
converts it to XML internally, and then creates a new Leo subtree from
that XML after the original, with 'NEW ' at the start of the top node's
name.  This updates all the headlines, so that the convenience only
previews (see below) are updated.  The original can be deleted if the
new subtree seems correct.

Conventions
===========

This is a valid XML file::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE dml SYSTEM "dml.dtd">
    <?xml-stylesheet href="common.css"?>
    <dml xmlns='http://example.com/' xmlns:other='http://other.com/'/>
      <block type='example'>Here's <other:b>some</other:b> text</block>
    </dml>
    <!-- This is the last line -->

Note the processing instruction (xml-stylesheet), the DTD (DOCTYPE),
the trailing comment (after the closing tag), and the pernicious
mixed content (three separate pieces of text in the ``<block/>`` element).
These commands attempt to deal with all of this.

 - A top level Leo node is created to hold these top level parts.  Its
   headline is the basename of the file.
 - The xml declaration is placed in the body of
   this top level Leo node
 - Below that, in the same body text, appears a simple namespace map::

     http://example.com/
     other: http://other.com/
     ...

   i.e. the default namespace first, and then any prefixed name spaces.
 - Below that, in the same body text, appears the ``DOCTYPE`` declaration
 - Children are added to this top level Leo node to represent the
   top level elements in the xml file.  Headlines have the following
   meanings:

       - ``? pi-target some="other" __CHK`` - i.e. questionmark,
         space, name of processing instruction target, start of processing
         instruction content.  Only the questionmark, which indicates
         the processing instruction, and the first word, which indicates
         the processing instruction target, matter.  The remainder is just
         a convenience preview of the processing instruction content, which
         is the Leo node's body text.

       - ``# This is *really* imp`` - i.e. hash,
         space, start of comment content.  Only the hash, which indicates
         the comment, matters.  The remainder is just
         a convenience preview of the comment content, which
         is the Leo node's body text.

       - ``tagname name_attribute start of element text`` - i.e. the name
         of an element followed by a convenience preview of the element's
         text content.  If the element has a ``name`` attribute that's
         included at the start of the text preview.  Only the first word
         matters, it's the name of the element.

 - Element's text is placed in the Leo node's body.  If the element has
   tailing text (the ``" text"`` tailing the ``<other:b/>`` element
   in the above example), that occurs in the Leo node's body separated
   by the `tailing text sentinel`::

       @________________________________TAIL_TEXT_______________________________

 - Element's attributes are stored in a dict ``p.v.u['_XML']['_edit']``
   on the Leo node. ``'_XML'`` is the uA prefix for these commands, and
   ``'_edit'`` is used by the ``attrib_edit`` plugin to identify
   attributes it should present to the user for editing. The
   ``attrib_edit`` plugin **should be enabled** and its ``v.u mode``
   activated (through its submenu on the Plugins menu). The attribute
   edit panel initially appears as a tab in the log pane, although it
   can be moved around by right clicking on the pane dividers if the
   ``viewrendered`` and ``free_layout`` plugins are enabled.

@nocolor-node

Almost from day one, Leo has defined gui base classes in the core, and
subclasses in gui plugins.

I plan to continue that organization, but I would like to remove some of the
wrapping layers if possible. The present scheme has one or two too many
redirection layers, and they are more of a nuisance than a help.

One idea would be to define **interface classes** that define the desired api's.
Unit tests could test that subclass implements the interface class, without
having to resort to quite as much error-prone machinery as at present.

@nocolor
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3578252
By: bwmulder

I have been thinking for a while that it ought to be possible to somehow  to
unite Leo with wiki features (my thinking is still vague at this point).

If you look at systems like Tiddlywiki (http://www.tiddlywiki.com/) you will
find that they already pretty much provide all the formatting features mentioned
in the article.

MoinMoin, another wiki (http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de), has started to use
a graphical interface for editing in the latest version.

Maybe Leo can be split up into three components:

1. A storage component is responsible for storing nodes. Currently, this is
just memory, but databases like shelve, Zope or sqllite should also be possible.

2. The control component is responsible for converting from the internal format
to external files which can be processed by existing compilers, searching within
a document, and the like.

3. A display component is responsible for interfacing with the user. If can
be TK, but it can also be something like the Tiddlywiki interface, which immediately
shows the formatting applied to text.

I don't know much about javascript, so I would have to learn more about this
language before doing anything in this direction.

As an intermediate step, maybe we could allow mixing RST processing with regular
program text.  Leo would produce two documents out of a source file: a version
for the compiler in plain ascii, and an HTML file for reading the source.
.. @+node:ekr.20120226180525.10191: *5* Run unit tests interactively?
@nocolor-node

Getting value from Bret Victor's video

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/9e1785ba4f57faf8

Thus, to associate code with unit tests, we need only create a
convention for associating source code with nodes.  But clones make
this trivial to do!

- @interactive-unit-tests
 - @itest
   - @test spam
   - (clone of) spam

This is all we would need to "declare" that @test spam should be run
whenever the spam node changes!

These are just first thoughts, made up as I am writing this post.  But
clearly, Leo can do more in this area.

Michael Manti
mmanti@mac.com

P.S. I think a feature that could make Leo *the* IDE for developing in 
interpreted languages is something like the (X)Emacs comint-mode.el for 
interacting with the shell and interpreters.

comint-mode.el serves as the basis for interactive modes for a number of
languages--OCaml, Haskell, SML, among them. It allows for editing expressions in
one buffer and triggering their evaluation in another buffer that has an
interpreter running in it, along with entering commands in the interpreter
buffer and moving back and forth through the history of their evaluation.

Imagine being able to highlight a node in Leo, and have all the code in it and
its children evaluated in an interpreter running in a separate window or pane,
much as Leo can open a Python shell now. Users of those languages could build
plug-ins specific to their language atop that layer, and the @language directive
could activate that. I think that would be very cool.
.. @+node:ekr.20071004120359.2: *6* expand-region-abbrev
See: regionalExpandAbbrev.

You may wish to expand an abbrev with a prefix attached; for example, if `cnst'
expands into `construction', you might want to use it to enter `reconstruction'.
It does not work to type recnst, because that is not necessarily a defined
abbrev. What you can do is use the command M-' (abbrev-prefix-mark) in between
the prefix `re' and the abbrev `cnst'. First, insert `re'. Then type M-'; this
inserts a hyphen in the buffer to indicate that it has done its work. Then
insert the abbrev `cnst'; the buffer now contains `re-cnst'. Now insert a
non-word character to expand the abbrev `cnst' into `construction'. This
expansion step also deletes the hyphen that indicated M-' had been used. The
result is the desired `reconstruction'.

If you actually want the text of the abbrev in the buffer, rather than its
expansion, you can accomplish this by inserting the following punctuation with
C-q. Thus, foo C-q , leaves `foo,' in the buffer.

.. @+node:ekr.20111010122531.15568: *5* @render-rest, @render-html trees
@language rest

The free_layout and viewrendered plugins are a huge step forward.  But
the lighter/heavier distinction suggests a new way to use them.

Suppose Leo supports @render-rest or @render-html.

This means that all nodes in the tree will have the body pane become a
rendering pane for rST or html.

Imagine LeoDocs completely rendered at all times.

Of course, for specific purposes, say in Leo's scripting chapter, we
might want to override these rendering directives (which should be
allowed in headlines too) with @no-render.

The point is that having *both* the original text *and* the rendered
text be visible is often too heavy: the user usually does not want to
know about the sources: the rendering is good enough.

I suppose for sophisticated users, something like show/hide-body pane
would be good commands to have, but that doesn't matter: those
commands to not increase the burden on the user while she is reading
the (rendered) docs.

I was wondering whether it would be a good idea to have leo
automatically delete the corresponding shadow file when a @shadow node
is deleted? Ditto for deleting the .leo_shadow dir when it is empty.

Answer:

My second thought is that this is too dangerous--shadow files might
turn out to be useful emergency backups.  I would prefer to have Leo
mess with the file system as little as possible.

 I Have a (maybe) great idea!   
2004-02-15 04:29

I've been using LEO for a while and finding surprinsingly powerfull new uses now
and then, (hey, not a week passes that i dont think to myself : "why did'nt
anyone thought of that kind of tool that is LEO. It's so stupid to program such
a tool, yet no one thought of doing such a thing ! ")

I was wondering if there was a leo keyword (beginning with "@") that would do a
feature I thought would be great: something such as :
@h
@endh
and of course, similarily...
@f
@endf

Standing for "Header", "End Header", "Footer" and "End Footer". Let me please explain ...

When creating files with @file (or nosentinels) I use the keyword "@others" in
the starting node body of the file and place in the file, as it's decendants
(children, grand-children & so on) some clones of other stuff somewhere else
outside of this file (usualy, clones of parts of program regrouped as children
of a "components" node up in the leo outline. Typical Example:

-Introduction
-+components
-a
-b
-c
-+@file program.BAS
-b
-c
-a

a, b, and c are clones and the @file node contains @others.

As you see, I proceed that way because in older programming languages or in
lower level languages, the order of components such as procs, declarations, etc
as an importance. It also has the implication that << and >> brackets are
irrelevant in my way of using leo.

Now, my feature that I looked for in the doc but could not find (so i suggest it
here in case no one had any need of this before) is that when used in the BODY
of a node part of an "@file" the @h and @endh would define a chunk of text in
the body, you've guessed it, to be added before _each_ children node and ONLY
children no grandchildren or any deeper. But It could also be used INSIDE the
body of a children to define headers or footers for IT'S OWN direct children.

so, eehh, do you see the relevance of such a feature? Have i explained it
clearly? maybe this would help:'

CONST baba=2 AS INTEGER
CONST bebe=7 AS INTEGER
CONST zaza=5 AS INTEGER
CONST bobo=1 AS INTEGER
... the beginning and end of each of those "parts-of-a-program" is the same for a potential lot of lines... 

To Be Precise : It's just really for adding something at end or beginning of a
direct children of a node part of an @file in the tangling process.

Is this feature already implemented but i have not found it? I'm pretty sure it easy to implement... what do you people think of this?
Thanks 
--
k

p.s. I'm the guy who proposed that in the untangling process, a clone would not
be updated by it's _Last-Instance-Found_ in the @file beeing untangled, but
instead updated by the _Last-Modified-One-Found_ in the @file... :)

Well, personally I'd like to have them included in the definition, but I think
Kent's preference for a separate node is reasonable to. If your function and
hence definition node is called "pluralize", and it's decorated with something
like "@authenticate_user", you may never check the innocent looking pluralize
definition to find out what on earth's triggering the mysterious network
database call. And this isn't a completely specious example, authentication may
have been added to stop pluralize being used in a user existence detection
exploit or something. OTOH in well behaved code like CherryPy apps you don't
want a separate node for every @cherrypy.expose.

Bottom line is I think we're asking for a set of @settings to fine tune python
import behavior:

@python_import_interdef = previous | next | own_node | ai
@python_import_decoration = next | own_node

I'm not sure I believe the AI option is possible / practical, and am not asking
for it, just listing it :-)

I'd also like

@python_import_init_in_class_node = true | false

as often there's more docs on a class in the __init__ than the class docstring.

I think that's really all we're talking about, some @settings to test during import.

.. @+node:ekr.20031218072017.674: *5* Caps lock affects keyboard shortcuts on Windows
Using leo under Windows, the keyboard shortcuts seem to use the "Caps Lock" state in determining the shift state when executing a shortcut.   For example, if the caps-lock key is on, then Ctrl-X is interpreted as Shift-Ctrl-X and cuts a node rather than selected text, and Shift-Ctrl-X is interpreted as Ctrl-X and cuts text.
.. @+node:ekr.20031218072017.675: *5* Tree problems
1. The border of the tree control is gray, and it is overwritten with large headlines.  This may be a Tk or Tkinter bug.

2. Adding trailing whitespace to a line in body text does not set the file-dirty mark.  This can never cause a derived file to become "out-of-synch" because the read code does not compare body text.

Apparently there is no way to fix this glitch because of holes in Tk's event mechanism.  Specifically, tree.idle_body_key has no way to tell directly what keystroke caused it to be entered.

However, I use a utility called AllChars (Free as in beer :-(  ) to be able
to type all kinds of chars on my US keyboard, and "Handything" to place the

them did not seem to make it go away. Still, on pressing alt+ctrl+uparrow I
end up at the next upper node etc...

 RE: BUG: Non-leading tabs not working properl   
2004-01-17 14:40  

 This seems to be a TK bug. I've reproduced the problem directly in Tk.

It's been around for a long time :-(

More details on this page, along with a patch for an earlier version.

http://www.qs.co.nz/Tcl/TkTabs.html

The Tk folks fixed a bug I reported with Ctrl-V behavior, but it took about a year for them to get to it. I don't have high expectations with this problem either, but I'll probably put together a patch for some of the recent version of Tk and submit the patches and bug report.

By: dthein

I've submitted a patch and bug report to the Tk project.

The patch, #879073, for those that want to fix this problem on their systems,
is at:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=879073&group_id=12997&atid=31299

And the bug report, #879077, is at:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=879077&group_id=12997&atid=11299
7

The patch is for 8.4.2.  If you have a different version, you can probably figure
out the changes needed by looking at the patch file.  If not, let me know your
version and I may be able to produce a patch for it.

Note: If you use tabs for anything other than leading whitespace, you will find
this patch really helpful.  I make lots of little tables when I'm documenting
or note-taking ... this fix really helped my sanity when making those tables
inside Leo.

-- Tabs are not expanded correctly in .c files, when language in preferences is set to c, and when the tabs occur in the middle of a line. The tabs are expanded as spaces until the next tab location is reached, then the tabs are expanded correctly. 
.. @+node:ekr.20040105070023.5: *6* Report 2
Leo 4.1 rc3, build 1.62 , December 19, 2003
Python 2.3.0, Tk 8.4.2
Linux 2.4.22-21mdkenterprise

1. Any tab typed before the first tab stop behaves correctly (the cursor is moved to the tab stop). Good.

2. Any tab typed after a non-tab character (even a space) _and_ after the first tab stop position doesn't behave like a tab and doesn't move the cursor to the next tab stop. Bad.

3. Any tab typed after a tab character will behave properly no matter what position on the line. Okay.

To reproduce this, set your global tab prefernence to 4. Show invisibles. And then create a node containing:

[BEGIN BODY TEXT]
@language plain
@tabwidth 8
[END BODY TEXT]

Create a child node to that one, containing:

[BEGIN BODY TEXT]
@root-code somefilename
\t\tThis works
bbb\tAnd This works
So\tdoes this

But, this \tdoes not.
Here is the two-tab \t\t behavior.
[END BODY TEXT]

I hope this is a Leo bug and not a Tk bug.

put the text insertion point in the space between 'a' and 'test' above. Enter 3 tabs in a row and watch it not work.

If your expansion works correctly, then maybe something with leoconfig?  But wait, Im using the leoconfig from the beta download.

This has been and continues to be a known issue with Tk. Has been logged as a
bug; no response from the Tk folks.

Note the work-around/patch in the followup post at the bottom of that page. Commenting out some statements in text.tcl removes the problem. 
.. @+node:ekr.20040220110030: *5* Change cursor when caps lock is down
@nocolor

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2431552
By: nobody

From: Rich

 I just got nipped twice by the following effect: the Caps-Lock key is ON, but
because the LED is on the Caps-Lock key, it is hidden behind my hand. I hit
Ctrl-x, expecting to cut my selection, but the entire node is cut.

   I know there's a problem with tk and the shift key status, so I'm wondering
if it would be possible to change the shape of the cursor when the Caps-Lock
is ON (preferrably a big red flashing blot 8-), or otherwise show that Caps-Lock
is active ( "CAPS" on a status line, for instance).

  Another way: I don't know if this goes against an "anti-modalism rule," but
only allowing Ctrl-Shift-x|c|v in the outline pane would also be acceptable
to me.

This document demonstrates what appears to be a bug in Leo 4.1 rc3, build 1.62 of December 19, 2003.

It has manifested when Leo is executed under Python 2.3.3, Tk 8.4.3 under Windows 2000.

In brief, derived XML files are not well-formed with respect to comments under some conditions.  Comments can wind up nested, which looks okay to humans but not to XML parsers.

This will produce, in the derived file, an XML comment with another XML comment
embedded. Or, if you prefer, it will produce an unclosed XML comment followed by
a well-formed one, followed by a string of text containing a comment-close
marker.

This text is sitting in the inner comment, according to the first view.
