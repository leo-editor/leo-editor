.. @+node:ekr.20180205125540.1: *3* #688: Summary of installing miniconda on Windows 10
Here is how I installed python2 and python3 on Windows.  This issue will remain open indefinitely.
```
# Install Miniconda itself
Install Miniconda3 to c:\Miniconda3.
Added c:\Miniconda3 and c:\Miniconda3\scripts to my local PATH variable.

   `conda list` lists only basic install tools: There is no python installed yet.

# Create the python2 and python3 environments
conda create -n python3 python=3
conda create -n python2 python=2

# Install pyqt
conda install -n python2 pyqt
conda install -n python3 pyqt

# Note: this would also have worked:
activate python2
conda install pyqt
activate python3
conda install pyqt

# Test launching Leo:
python c:\leo.repo\leo-editor\launchLeo.py --gui=qttabs

# Add a2 and a3 batch files as abbreviations:
a2.bat: activate python2
a3.bat: activate python3

# The rest of the installations were done after doing a2 and/or a3:
(python2/3) PIP install pyenchant
(python3) conda install jupyter
(python2/3) conda install docutils
(python2/3) conda install pyflakes
(python2) PIP install html
(python3) PIP install html **FAILS**
(python2/3) conda install markdown
(python2/3) conda install networkx
(python2/3) conda install pylint (works, but pylint is buggy)
(python2/3) conda install pylint=1.7 (downgrade warning accepted)

# Install pyinstaller and fix for a recent pyinstaller bug:
# https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/pull/3233#issuecomment-362094587
(python2/3) PIP install pyinstaller
(python2/3) PIP install https://github.com/bjones1/pyinstaller/archive/pyqt5_fix.zip

pyinstaller --clean --win-private-assemblies launchLeo-unified.spec FAILS:
    Cannot find existing PyQt5 plugin directories
    Paths checked: C:/Users/builder/3/conda-bld/qt_1505994166793/_h_env/Library/plugins

renamed pylint.bat to ll.bat, to invoke pylint properly.

# Changed the target of the command-prompt alias:

    %windir%\system32\cmd.exe "/k c:\scripts\a3.bat"
    # /k executes a3.bat without ending the shell
```

**Notes**

- jupyter should have been installed in a separate jupyter environment, not in the python3 environment.
- Pylint complains about html.parser in the python2 environment.
.. @+node:ekr.20180205125504.1: *3* #699: Summary of installing Anaconda3 on Windows
Here is how I installed Anaconda3 on Windows 10:

  Downloaded Anaconda3-5.0.1-Windows-x86_64.exe
  Install to c:\Anaconda3
  Added c:\Anaconda3 and c:\Anaconda3\scripts to my user path
  PIP install zerorpc
  Install node.js from node-v8.9.4-x64.msi
  npm install zerorpc **FAILS** Googling gives [this page about windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools/issues/56).

**Install [windows-build-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools)**

Run in administrative powershell:
```
    npm install --global --production --windows-build-tools
    added 128 packages in 460.125s
```
This downloads and installs Visual C++ Build Tools 2015.

**Status**

- pylint version is 1.7.4: no need to downgrade to 1.7
- Leo runs, but without spell checking. See [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/HzxTtIQjxuY/29JoaJYDBgAJ).
`conda install pyenchant` fails: The 'enchant' C library was not found.
.. @+node:ekr.20180205125401.1: *3* #701: Summary of installing zerorpc on Windows
Installing the **python** zerorpc is easy: `PIP install zerorpc`

Install node.js from node-v8.9.4-x64.msi. To test, type `npm` from a console.

`npm install zerorpc` **FAILS**

Googling finds [npm windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools/issues/56). This installs Visual C++ Build Tools 2015(!)

Install windows-build-tools, do the following **in an administrative powershell**:
```
    npm install --global --production --windows-build-tools
    added 128 packages in 460.125s
```
Now the following works:

    npm install zerorpc

To test, run the following in **separate consoles**:
```
python c:\test\zerorpc.py
node c:\test\zerorpc.js
```
The output in the node console is "Hello, World!"

This info item describes how to install and run Vitalije's clojurescript demo project, **leocljs**. leocljs uses [electron.js](https://electronjs.org/) and [Om/React](https://github.com/omcljs/om). Vitalije first announced leocljs [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/Isd93qGd-RU/SaQoVv7gCQAJ). The *original* sources and documentation are [here](https://repo.computingart.net/leocljs/tree?ci=tip). The *current* sources are in the [leo/proto/Vitalije/leocljs](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/tree/proto/leo/proto/Vitalije/leocljs) folder of Leo's [proto](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/tree/proto) branch. 

This item is a distillation of information from [this post]( https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/Isd93qGd-RU/tnRajD7qCQAJ) and [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/wAmZfFCQWVU/mwhMfQ_LCgAJ) and [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/pUN94kB5cLE). All comments and corrections are welcome.

**Notation**:  `leocljs>command` means run command in leo/proto/Vitalije/leocljs

- Install [java](https://java.com/en/), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [electron](https://electronjs.org/), and [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/).
  Install node.js and leiningen *globally* with the -g option.
  See #703 for detailed instructions about installing and running electron.
- Build the app *once only*: `leocljs>lein descjop-once-dev`
- Run the app using two *separate* consoles:

    - **Console 1**: `leocljs>lein descjop-figwheel`
       This monitors and builds leiningen apps.
       A prompt will appear when the app loads.
       Close console 1 *after* closing console 2.

    - **Console2**:  `leocljs>electron app\dev`
       This runs the app.

@language rest

.. @+node:ekr.20100223100750.5843: *4* Original post by Robin Dunn
Here are the emacs features that I use very often that any editor would
need to have in order for me to switch.  I've seen some editors with
some of these, but none with all unless it is an emacs clone.  I'll
leave out the obvious things like platform independence, good syntax
highlighting, calltips or auto-completion.  Also, these features are
just dealing with the code editor portion of the app, if it is more than
that (like a full IDE) then some of these things may or may not apply to
the non code editor parts:

* (done) Python should be just one of the languages that this editor supports,
not the primary target.  I spend as much time in C/C++ as I do Python,
and my editor of choice needs to help me with C/C++ coding just as much
as it does with Python.  So some sort of support for calltips and
auto-completion would be marvelous, and also being able to act as a
front-end for gdb since I currently use emacs for that most of the time.

* (done) Absolutely every feature or action must be able to be done with just
the keyboard.  Moving the hand back and forth to the mouse wastes time,
breaks concentration and contributes to RSI.  Multi-key sequences are
fine as long as they are grouped in a logical fashion.  For example in
emacs all of the version control features are accessible via the
Ctrl-x,v sequence plus one more letter.

* (done) Incremental search, both forward and reverse, and wrapping around
after you've reached the end or the beginning of the document.  I like
to have the same key to start the search and also do a search-next after
you've typed all the characters you are searching for, and also to have
backspace go back one search position and/or remove one character from
the search text.

* (done) Multiple top level windows, and able to show any buffer in any TLW,
including those that are already displayed in another TLW.  Of course
there should be key-bindings available for opening a new TLW, cycling
forward and backward through the buffer list, and a way to select a
buffer from a popup list of buffer/file names.

* (to be improved) The Kill-Ring.  For those of you that have never used an emacs-like
editor it works like this:  There is a collection of the N previous
blocks of text that have been cut or copied (in emacs 'cut' == 'kill'
more or less)  When I do a yank (paste) it uses the last thing put in
the kill-ring.  If I then immediately use another key-binding then it
replaces that pasted text with the next item in the kill ring, and so on
until I eventually wrap around get back to the first one in the ring, or
I do some other command or move the cursor somewhere else.

* (done) Registers.  A text snippet can be copied into a register, which is
like the kill ring except you refer to each one by name, where the names
are 'a' through 'z'.  You can also append to a register that already has
text in it, and you can paste the contents of a register into the
document at the current cursor location.

* (done) Able to have selections be either a stream of characters or a
rectangle.  A stream selection is like what you have in all text
editors, it starts from position a on line N and continues forward or
back to position b on line M and includes all the characters in between.

  A rectangle selection is all the characters between position a and b
on lines N to M.  In other words, it has width and height and it might
be something like positions 5 through 10 on lines 20 to 25.  Cutting or
deleting a rectangle removes the text in the rectangle and shifts any
text to the right of the rectangle over.  It does not remove any lines
although they may end up being empty.  Pasting a rectangle inserts the
new text with the upper-left of the rectangle at the current cursor
position, shifts existing text to the right if needed, and fills with
spaces on the left if a line affected by the paste is not long enough.
New lines are not added unless the file needs to be extended to
accommodate the rectangle paste.  Rectangles can also be put into registers.

* (to be improved) Good keystroke macro recording and the ability to save and load
keystroke macros, and the ability to assign a key-binding to a saved
recorded macro. Any time I need to make the same edits to a bunch of
lines or groups of lines I'll record doing it on the first one including
the keystrokes needed to reposition for the next line, and then stop
recording and then it's just one keystroke to replay the keystrokes for
every other line that needs it done.  I record, use and throw away up to
a dozen or so macros per day.

* (done, and better than asserted) If you must have a toolbar make it optional
and keep it simple. Toolbars require the mouse and the goal is to keep the hand
off the mouse as much as possible.

* (done) Similarly, avoid using popup dialogs whenever possible.  This includes
things like the file dialog.  I don't mind seeing the file dialog if I
select a menu item, because most likely my hand is already on the mouse,
but the rest of the time I just want to hit a key, type a path name
(with tab-completion to help find stuff, up/down keys to cycle through
past selections) and press enter.  So I would prefer this editor to have
something like emacs' minibuffer, or the QuickFind panel in Firefox.  In
other words, when there is something you would normally use a dialog for
just create a small panel that rolls up from the bottom of the frame,
put the keyboard focus there, perhaps do stuff in the main buffer as
they are typing if appropriate, and then when the user is done the panel
rolls out of sight again and keyboard focus is restored to their active
buffer.  This can be done for file open/saves, search & replace,
specifying build or grep commands (see next item) choosing to execute
some editor function by name that may not have some key-binding yet (see
item after next) etc.

* (done, with user @commands)

Flexible build/grep commands.  Emacs handles both of these in almost
the same way so I'll list them together here.  I hit a key and am
presented with either the default, or the most recently used compile or
grep command.  I can edit the command or use the up/down arrows to
select previous commands that I've used.  I then hit enter and emacs
runs the command putting the output in an editor buffer.  There is a key
I can hit to kill the compile if needed.  It then parses the output and
there is a key I can use to find the file listed in the compile or grep
output, load it, and position the cursor on the reported line.  (This
can even be done while the compile/grep is still running.)

* (done) For access to editor commands/functionality that may not be bound to a
keystroke it's real nice to have the ability to hit a key, type the
command name, press enter and then it's done.  This can also allow for
commands that might need to prompt for parameters, be interactive, etc.
  All editor commands should be named and can be bound to keys by name
or executed by name in this way.

* (done) def aproposFindCommands (self, event=None):

    '''Prints a discussion of of Leo's find commands.'''

    << define s >>

    self.c.putApropos(s)
 search.  Emacs has support for regular expression search modes
for all of the search types, incremental search, search/replace,
although I don't use it that much.

* (done, or not needed, depending on your point of view)
Multi-file search and replace.  Be able to select files interactively,
or by wildcard, or both.  Enter search string, or regex, and replace
text.  The editor loads each file and does the search, allowing you to
choose for each one whether to do the replacement, or replace all.

* If it is a full IDE it would be nice to have a way to start just the
code editor portion for quick edits.

Things that would be nice to have, but that I could live without:

(All of these things can be done easily with @command)

* Interactive diffs, merges and applying of patches.

* Able to be a front-end for gdb.

* Able to be a front-end for CVS, SVN, etc.

* (done) Be able to run shell commands, or the shell itself in an editor buffer.

* (easy) have a built-in psychotherapist or be able to play towers of hanoi.  ;-)

Robin Dunn's post, reproduced at:
http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/4f76a0f57759aba
continues to be one of the benchmarks for Leo.

Leo 4.7 went out the door today.  It contains many important
improvements, but few directly related to Robin's important post.
That doesn't mean Robin's post is irrelevant, but it does mean that
other considerations were more relevant :-)  In particular, Leo passes
all unit tests with Python 2.6 and Python 3.1.

Leo 4.8 will concentrate on better support for vim-like bindings.  As
a happy side effect, this will make Leo compliant with almost all
unfinished aspects of Robin's mission.

There are two major items from Robin's list that are incomplete in
Leo:

* The Kill-Ring.  Leo does have a kill ring.  The vim work will fix
discrepancies between how Leo, emacs and vim handle the kill ring.

* Good keystroke macro recording and the ability to save and load
keystroke macros.  This happen as part of support for vim's "dot"
command.  To some extent, Leo's execute-script command compensates for
wimpy macro support, but I'd like to do better.

The following could be done easily using Leo's @command or @button
features.  There doesn't seem to be much demand for them in Leo, but
I'll list them here for completeness.

- Flexible build/grep commands.
- Interactive diffs, merges and applying of patches.
- Able to be a front-end for gdb. (Leo has a plugin to do this).
- Able to be a front-end for CVS, SVN, etc.
- Have a built-in psychotherapist or be able to play towers of
hanoi.  ;-)

As always, I invite you all to try Leo, and to ask for features that
would be important to you.

======

P.S. Leo does have auto-completion.  It will be improved in Leo 4.9.

.. @+node:ekr.20110616084347.14800: *4* Post to pyxides, 2011/07/10
http://groups.google.com/group/pyxides

On 2010/02/23 I commented about Leo 4.7 as it relates to Robin Dunn's post,
http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/4f76a0f57759aba

A few weeks ago Leo 4.9 went out the door. Imo, this version of Leo has
accomplished the mission. Leo has all the important features that Leo's users
have requested. Yes, wishlist items remain. See:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bugs

None of these wish-list items interferes in any way with Leo's day-to-day
operation. Furthermore, many of Leo's essential features moot the need for more
traditional features.

For example, Leo 4.9 adds full support for macros. Recording, saving, editing
and retrieving macros is easier in Leo than in other editors because Leo stores
macros in @macro nodes, not external files. But few, if any, of Leo's users are
likely to use macros because Leo's @button nodes make all of Python's scripting
abilities easily available on a node-by-node or outline-wide basis.

It may be that Leo could benefit from some Emacs-like or vim-like features, but
that doesn't seem so likely.  Leo has many users who also use Emacs and vim, and
they seem happy enough :-)

Finally, Leo offers features that have no counterpart at all in editors
like Emacs and vim. For example, the rst3 command converts an outline to
restructured text. See: rstplugin3.html Yes, one could imagine an org-mode
command that does this, but the fact is that Leo's outline orientation has
given it abilities possessed by no other editor or IDE.

I invite you to try Leo. If, after using Leo for
real work, you find you would like some new feature, then by all means ask.

To generate a SSH key using PuTTY:

Execute c:\"Program Files"\tortoiseCVS\PUTTYGEN.EXE

Select "SSH2 DSA", within the "Parameters" section.

Click on the "Generate" button. Follow the instruction to move the mouse over
the blank area of the program in order to create random data used by PUTTYGEN to
generate secure keys. Key generation will occur once PUTTYGEN has collected
sufficient random data.

Enter edream@cvs.sourceforge.net for the key comment (depends on what host the
key is for)

(Omit) Enter the desired passphrase in the "Key passphrase" and "Confirm passphrase"
fields. If the key will be used for automation of operations (i.e. as part of a
script), you may choose to omit this step from the key generation process.

Click on the "Save private key" button. Use the resulting dialog to save your
private key data for future use. You may use a filename such as
"SourceForge-Shell.ppk" or "SourceForge-CF.ppk". The .ppk extension is used for
PuTTY Private Key files.

Go to the SSH key posting page on the SourceForge.net site: http://sourceforge.net/account/

Thanks for this, I hope others will take a stab at it as well, given
sane instructions (I burned my free cycles frantically coding this
thing and neglected the all-important HOWTO). This is important
because functional completion is the single most important thing still
missing from Leo. Or, well, was ;-).

Especially the presentation part (QCompleter) needs some care, so you
can operate it from your keyboard alone. It should probably be moved
to core (qtgui, perhaps leoQTextEditWIdget), so codewise completer can
just invoke w.complete(list_of_completions) that will bring up the

Yes, currently Leo uses it as an external program ("codewise m

Someone just has to write the vim integration plugin (or whatever they

Sorry for being a bit vague, I was talking about the Leo source files themselves. I don't know what you use to edit them, ;^))) but in version 3.6 they still have \r\n as end-of-line. 

If Leo itself does not solve the problem, may I suggest the

.. @+node:ekr.20031218072017.387: *5* The solution
Under unix, python writes "\n" as "\n"; under windows, it writes it as "\r\n". The unix python interpreter ignores trailing "\r" in python source files. There are no such guarantees for other languages. Unix users should be able to get rid of the cosmetically detrimental "\r" either by running dos2unix on the offending files, or, if they're part of a .leo project, reading them into leo and writing them out again.

2002-09-17 09:34  
Oh, I see. Thanks very much for this clarification. 

Just to make sure I understand you: the problem with '\r' characters is that: 

1. I am creating LeoPy.leo and LeoDocs.leo on Windows and 
2. People are then using these files on Linux. 

and the way to remove the '\r' characters: 

1. I could run dos2unix on all distributed files just before committing to CVS or making a final distribution or 
2. People could, say, do the following: 

Step 1: Read and Save the .leo files, thereby eliminating the '\r' in those files and 
Step 2: Use the Write @file nodes command on all derived files to clear the '\r' in those files. 

Do you agree so far? 

> Under unix, python writes "\n" as "\n"; under windows, it writes it as "\r\n". 

I am going to see if there is any way to get Python to write a "raw" '\n' to a file. I think there must be. This would solve the problem once and for all. 

Thanks again for this most helpful comment.

Nope. Exactly wrong. In 2.2 and those before, when files are opened in
*text* mode (no "b") then reading them will provide Unix-style line endings
(newline only). When you open files in binary mode then you see the bytes
stored in the file.

On Unix systems there's no difference in the contents of a file whether in
binary or text mode. On Windows a file is shorter by the number of carriage
returns. On the Mac I have no idea what they do. Probably just carriage
returns, to be different :-)

2.3 will be a bit more flexible about such mattrers.

.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16840: *5* UI notes
Both the legacy and new completer now work *exactly* the same way, because
they both use the AutoCompleterClass to compute the list of completions.

The strict "stateless" requirement means that the "intermediate"
completions must be entered into the body pane while completion is active.
It works well as a visual cue when using the tabbed completer: indeed, the
tabbed completer would be difficult to use without this cue.

The situation is slightly different with the qcompleter. Adding code before
the user accepts the completion might be considered an "advanced" feature.
However, it does have two important advantages, especially when "chaining"
across periods: it indicates the status of the chaining and it limits what
must appear in the qcompleter window.
.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16841: *5* Appearance
There is little change to the legacy completer, except that no text is
highlighted in the body pane during completion. This is calmer than before.
Furthermore, there is no longer any need for highlighting, because when the
user types a backspace the legacy completer now simply deletes a single
character instead of the highlighted text.

One minor change: the legacy completer now *does* insert characters that do
not match the start of any possible completion. This is an experimental
feature, but it might play well with using codewise completions as a
fallback to Leo-related completions.

.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16842: *5* Performance
Performance of Leo-related completions is *much* better than before. The
old code used Python's inspect module and was horribly complex. The new
code uses eval and is perfectly straightforward.

The present codewise-related code caches completions for all
previously-seen prefixes. This dramatically speeds up backspacing. Global
caching is possible because completions depend *only* on the present
prefix, *not* on the presently selected node. If ContextSniffer were used,
completions would depend on the selected node and caching would likely be
impractical. Despite these improvements, the performance of
codewise-oriented completions is noticeably slower than Leo-related
completions.

The ac.get_cached_options cuts back the prefix until it finds a cached
prefix. ac.compute_completion_list then uses this
(perhaps-way-too-long-list) as a starting point, and computes the final
completion list by calling g.itemsMatchingPrefixInList.

This may not be absolutely the fastest way, but it is much simpler and more
robust than attempting to do "prefix AI" based on comparing old and new
prefixes. Furthermore, this scheme is completely independent of the how
completions are actually computed. The autocompleter now caches options
lists, regardless of whether using eval or codewise.

In most cases the scheme is extremely fast: calls to get_completions
replace calls to g.itemsMatchingPrefixInList. However, for short prefixes,
the list that g.g.itemsMatchingPrefixInList scans can have thousands of
items. Scanning large lists can't be helped in any case for short prefixes.

Happily, the new scheme is still *completely* stateless: the completionDict
does *not* define state (it is valid everywhere) and no state variables had
to be added. In short, the new caching scheme is much better than before,
and it probably is close to optimal in most situations.
.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16843: *4* About Key handling
@language rest

The following sections deal with different aspects of how Leo handle's
keystrokes that the user types. This is the most complex code in Leo.
.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16849: *5* Key bindings
There are two kinds of bindings, gui bindings and pane bindings.

**Gui bindings** are the actual binding as seen by  whatever gui is in effect.
Leo binds every key that has a binding to k.masterKeyHander.

At present Leo makes gui bindings in several places, all equivalent.
Bindings are made to callbacks, all of which have this form::

     def callback(event=None,k=k,stroke=stroke):
        return k.masterKeyHandler(event,stroke)

As a result, changing gui bindings actually has no effect whatever.
It would be clearer to have a single place to make these bindings...

In any case, the purpose of these callbacks is to capture the value of 'stroke' so
that it can be passed to k.masterKeyHandler.
This relieves k.masterKeyHandler of the impossible task of computing the stroke from the event.

**Important**:  No function argument is ever passed to k.masterKeyHandler from these callbacks,
because k.masterKeyHandler binds keys to command handlers as described next.

**Pane bindings** are bindings represented by various Python dictionaries in the
keyHandlerClass (see below). k.masterKeyHandler and its helpers use these
dictionaries to call the proper command or mode handler. This logic is hairy,
but it is completely separate from the gui binding logic.

Here are the dictionaries that k.masterKeyHandler uses:

- c.commandsDict:
  Keys are minibuffer command names; values are functions f.

- k.inverseCommandsDict:
  Keys are f.__name__l values are emacs command names.

- k.bindingsDict:
  Keys are shortcuts; values are *lists* of g.bunch(func,name,warningGiven).

- k.masterBindingsDict:
  Keys are pane names: 'all','text',etc. or mode names.
  Values are dicts:  keys are strokes; values are g.Bunch(commandName,func,pane,stroke).

- k.modeWidgetsDict:
  Keys are mode names; values are lists of widgets to which bindings have been made.

- k.settingsNameDict:
  Keys are lowercase settings; values are 'real' Tk key specifiers.
  Important: this table has no inverse.

- inverseBindingDict:
  This is *not* an ivar; it is computed by k.computeInverseBindingDict().
  Keys are emacs command names; values are *lists* of shortcuts.

.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16851: *6* All events are key events
All event objects passed around Leo are *key* event objects. Taking a look
at the eventFilter method, we see clearly see that *only* key events ever
get passed to Leo's core. All other events are handled by Qt-specific event
handlers.

As can be seen, these non-key events *can* be passed to Leo, but only as
the event arg in g.doHook (!) At present, no plugin ever calls
k.masterKeyHandler. The only call to k.masterKeyHandler in qtGui.py is the
expected call in eventFilter.

There are other calls to k.masterKeyHandler in Leo's core, but we can prove
(by induction, if you will), that all events passed to k.masterKeyHandler
are proper leoKeyEvent objects.
.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16852: *6* c.check_event
The essential invariant is that the events passed to Leo's core methods
really are leoKeyEvent objects created by qtGui.py. Rather than asserting
this invariant, the code will contains calls to c.check_event in essential
places. c.check_event is a "relaxed" place to do as much error checking is
needed. In particular, running the unit tests calls c.check_event many
times.

c.check_event is a happy "accident". It turns out to be the essential
consistency check that continually verifies that the Qt event methods are
delivering the expected keys to k.masterKeyHandler.
.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16853: *5* About the KeyStroke class
The KeyStroke class distinguish between "raw" user settings
and the "canonicalized" form used throughout Leo. Indeed,
the ability to explicitly distinguish between the two, using
type checking, substantially clarifies and simplifies the
code.

The KeyStroke class makes possible vital type-related
assertions. Knowing *for sure* exactly what crucial data is
and what it means is a huge step forward.

Objects of the KeyStroke class can be used *exactly* as a
strings may be used:

A. KeyStroke objects may be used as dictionary keys, because
they have __hash__ methods and all the so-called rich
comparison methods: __eq__, __ne__, __ge__, __gt__, __le__
and __lt__. Note that KeyStroke objects may be compared with
other KeyStroke objects, strings and None.

B. At present, KeyStroke objects supports the find, lower
and startswith methods. This simplifies the code
substantially: we can apply these methods to either strings
or KeyStroke objects, so there is no need to create
different versions of the code depending on the value of
g.new_strokes.

However, having the KeyStroke class support string methods
is bad design. Indeed, it is a symptom that the client code
that uses KeyStroke objects knows too much about the
internals of KeyStroke objects. Instead, the KeyStroke class
should have higher-level methods that use s.find, s.lower
and s.startswith internally.

You could say that the fact that code in leoKeys.py calls
s.find, s.lower and s.startswith is a symptom of non OO
programming. The internal details of settings and strokes
"pollutes" the code. This must be fixed. This will likely
create opportunities for further simplifications.

> Why not just have .s attribute in KeyStroke, that contains
the string version?

It is truly impossible to understand the key code without
knowing whether an object is a string representing a user
setting or the canonicalized version used in Leo's core,
that is, a KeyStroke object. Using ks.s instead of ks
destroys precisely the information needed to understand the
code.

Again, this is not a theoretical concern. The key code now
contains assertions of the form::

    assert g.isStroke(stroke)

or::

    assert g.isStrokeOrNone(stroke)

Getting these assertions to pass in *all* situations
required several important revisions of the code. The code
that makes the assertions pass is "innocuous", that is,
almost invisible in the mass of code, but obviously, these
small pieces of code are vital.

This is in no way a violation of OO principles. The code is
not dispatching on the type of objects, it is merely
enforcing vital consistency checks. This code is complex:
confusion about the types of objects is intolerable.
Happily, the resulting clarity allows the code to be
substantially simpler than it would otherwise be, which in
turn clarifies the code further, and so on...
.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16854: *5* Simplifying the Qt input code
The Qt key input code can be greatly simplified by calling a
new k.makeKeyStrokeFromData factory method. At present, the
Qt key input code knows *all* the details of the format of
*canonicalized* settings. This is absolutely wretched
design.

Instead, the Qt input key code should simply pass the key
modifiers and other key information to
k.makeKeyStrokeFromData, in a some kind of "easy" format.
For example, the Qt input key code would represent the
internal Qt modifiers as lists of strings like "alt",
"ctrl", "meta", "shift". k.makeKeyStrokeFromData would then
create a *user* setting from the components, and then call
k.strokeFromSetting to complete the transformation.
.. @+node:ekr.20131011050613.16855: *5* Typed dicts
Leo's key dictionaries will always be complex, but basing

The g.TypedDict and g.TypedDictOfLists classes are useful
for more than type checking: they have unique names and a
dump method that dumps the dict in an easy-to-read format
that includes the name, and valid types for keys and values.

Plain dicts do have their uses, but for "long-lived" dicts,
and dicts passed around between methods, plain dicts are as
ill-advised as g.Bunches.

From: "Edward K. Ream" <edreamleo@gmail.com>

As the title indicates, this thread will consist of what could be
called an online engineering notebook.  Please feel free to ignore.

Key bindings are one of the most difficult and complex parts of Leo.
This can't be helped: Leo's goals for key bindings are ambitious.

The present bug, https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/879331, is
due to a significant design oversight.  Redefining a binding for a
command x to key y affects not just command x but all other commands
presently bound to y!

Alas, the present binding tables are already complex.  I am almost at
the limit of what I can hold in working memory as it is.  Adding
significant additional complexity risks creating virtually impossible-
to-understand code.

There are two conflicting desires in play here:

1. To make the minimum changes needed.  While reasonable in itself,
this promises to increase overall complexity.

2. To decrease overall complexity.  While reasonable in itself, this
promises significant overall changes to the code.

Combining these two desires yields a strategy of finding a minimal
change that reduces overall complexity :-)  It's a big ask.

.. @+node:ekr.20070623150151: *4* How to make Leo commands undoable
The chapter commands provide a good example.  In this file, see the node:

Code-->Core classes...-->@thin leoChapters.py-->class chapterController-->Undo

The general plan is this:

1. The command handler calls a **beforeCommand** method before changing the outline.

The beforeCommand method creates a g.Bunch that contains all the information needed to
restore the outline to its previous state. Typically, the beforeCommand method
will call c.undoer.createCommonBunch(p), where p is, as usual, c.p.

2. After changing the outline the command handler calls an **afterCommand** method.

This method should take as one argument the g.Bunch returned by the
beforeCommand method. In the discussion below, denote this bunch by b. The
afterCommand method adds any information required to redo the operation after
the operation has been undone.

The afterCommand method also sets b.undoHelper and b.redoHelper to two method
that actually perform the undo and redo operations. (Actually, the beforeCommand
method could also set these two entries).

When the afterCommand method has 'filled in' all the entries of b, the
afterCommand method must call u.pushBead(b). This pushes all the undo
operation on a stack managed by the Leo's undoer, i.e., c.commands.undoer.

3. The undoer calls the undoHelper and redoHelper methods to perform the actual undo and redo operations.

The undoer handles most of the housekeeping chores related to undo and redo.  All the undoHelper and redoHelper methods have to do is actually alter Leo's outline.

**Note**: the undoer creates an ivar (instance variable) of the *undoer* class for every entry in the bunch b passed as an argument to u.pushBead(b).  For example, suppose u = c.commands.under and that b has ivars 'a','b' and 'c'.  Then, on entry to the undoHelper and the redoHelper the u.a, u.b and u.c ivars will be defined.  This makes it unnecessary for the undoHelper or the redoHelper to 'unpack' b explicitly.

Writing correct undo and redo helpers is usually a bit tricky.  The code is often subtly different from the original code that implements a command.  That just can't be helped.

Sorry to take so long to reply.  I've been buried in work and haven't kept up
with some email.

Here's the link to the site where I posted the folder you have:
<http://homepage.mac.com/jdgleeson/>  It's the small file named "Leo.zip" (23
KB), not the large file "Leo-4.3-alpha-2.dmg" (20 MB).

I agree that I did not write very clear instructions, beginnng with the first
step, where I should have also said:  "It is important to use version 1.1.8
of py2app, which is only available through svn.  The version on the py2app website
is 1.1.7, which creates buggy Tkinter apps. If you try to use version 1.1.7,
the Leo app it creates will give you a message saying that Tkinter is not properly
installed.  Your installation is fine; otherwise you could not have even built
Leo.app with py2app, because py2app copies the essential parts of Tcl/Tk into
the application bundle to make the app completely standalone."

I haven't tried intalling the Fink subversion -- I'm using DarwinPorts
<http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/>.  But there's a simpler alternative than
DarwinPorts. Metissian releases OS X packages of Subversion clients
<http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/>

AFAIK, the command "python setup.py bdist_mpkg --open" only applies to the py2app
1.1.8 distribution.  By the way, bdist_mpkg is distributed with py2app. It creates
a package around the setup.py script (more specialized than Platypus).  I don't
have any experience with bdist_mpkg yet.

'Copy the leo folder into this directory' is horrible. I'm glad you figured
it out -- I'm not sure I could have.

"python setup.py py2app -a" should be run in the folder with the readme file,
which also contains the setup.py file that the command refers to.  Most importantly,
the folder in which this command is run must contain the leo folder -- which
it does only if you are brilliant enough to decode my instructions.   ;)

Subject:  Leo, Mac OS X 10.3, and VPython 

I've been evaluating leo or vpython programming on  Mac OS X 10.3, and 
have some observations and a suggestion.

Observations:
- Leo runs under X11 as well as under OS X.
- My X11 python configuration was created using the recipe at XXX (which enables vpython).
- The OS X configuration is vanilla MacPython from MacPython.org, along with AquaTclTk batteries included XXX.

In both environments I can run leo under python leo.py and under idle.
Under OS X we get font smoothing, but we can't run visual python programs (python crashes;  this is a known incompatibility with  MacPython.)

- Under X11 we can run visual python programs like this one
    #box.py
    from visual import *
    box()

And we can even run them under leo (under X11). HOWEVER, when the visual python program is terminated, leo vanishes (leo and the vp program apparently run in the same space)

Under x11, we can keep leo alive by putting the vp program in its own space:

    os.popen3('/sw/bin/python /Users/jis/box.py')

However,  this doesn't let us see the output of stderr and stdout.  
Those text streams are available...

    def do(cmd='ls'):
        from os import popen3
        pIn,pOut,pErr=0,1,2
        popenResults=popen3(cmd)
        print popenResults[pOut].read()
        print popenResults[pErr].read()

    import os
    do('/sw/bin/python /Users/jis/box.py')

...but only when the vpython program terminates.

Here's the good news:  if we execute our vp program with 
/sw/bin/idle.py rather than with python, we get to see the program 
output in real time (under idle, under X11).

    import os
    os.chdir('/sw/lib/python2.3/idlelib')
    os.popen3('/sw/bin/python idle.py -r /Users/jis/box.py')

#this runs as an executed script in leo, and produces a live idle 
with real time ongoing output.

Now, while idle is running, leo sits in suspended animation.  But when 
the vpython program terminates, we are left in idle, and when idle is 
terminated, leo becomes active again.

It would be even better if leo were not suspended (using os.spawn, 
perhaps) but the real point is that I would really really like leo's 
"Execute script" command to execute code this way and spare me having 
to  hard-write the path to box.py.  It ought to be possible to 
eliminate os.chdir as well.

.. @+node:ekr.20040104162835.13: *6* Fink & aqua
Yes, fink does have pre-built Pythons, both 2.1 and 2.2.  (If you don't 
see them it probably means you don't have the right servers listed in 
your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list file.)  However, the versions of Python 
you'd get through fink are set up to run under X Windows, which I don't 
think is what you want.

I think what you want is MacPython which can run Tk programs like Leo 
under Aqua.  That's what I use these days.

I can tell from your question that you don't understand the following 
differences between the versions of Python available:

1) The version that comes with OS X is a text only one which doesn't 
have Tk.  Leo can't run under that.  Also, I hate Apple for including 
this instead of one that does have Tk and I hope they'll fix it some 
day.

2) You can get a version of Python from fink with has Tk but which runs 
under X Windows.  I don't think you want that.

3). You can also get MacPython which has Tk but it's a version of Tk 
that uses the Aqua windowing system, not X Windows.

So Tk can either be present or not and if it is present it can use 
either X Windows or Aqua.  You want it present and using Aqua, I think.


.. @+node:ekr.20040104162835.14: *6* Mac, Fink, etc.
> 1. The python that FC installs is MacPython.  I think that because the
> MacPython docs talk about Fink.

Nope.  The python installed by FC knows nothing about the Mac.  It 
thinks it's running on a Unix machine.  And it uses a version of Tk 
which thinks it's running on a Unix machine.  The window standard on 
Unix is called X (or X11 or XFree86, all the same thing).  So the main 
reason to run Leo this way would be to get an idea of how it works for 
Unix/Linux users.  But when programs run under X, they don't look like 
Mac programs.  They don't get all those glossy, translucent widgets 
that Aqua provides.  They really look like they would on a Unix/Linux 
machine.

Aqua is the native windowing system on Mac.  MacPython is set up to 
work with it.  Most Mac users will want Leo to work this way.  That's 
what I do.

Yes, I think that's all I installed to get Tk to work under Aqua.  You 
don't have to deinstall the FC stuff.  All the FC stuff lives in its 
own world under /sw and runs under X.  It won't conflict with the Mac 
world.

.. @+node:ekr.20040104162835.15: *6* Double clicking on Linux
Double-clickable things (i.e. Macintosh applications) are usually 
actually folders with a name that ends in .app.  The file you found is 
probably executable only from the command line, not by double clicking 
it.  So I think if you run it from the command line it will work but 
will not know about Tk because Apple's version was built without Tk 
support.

You can also execute the .app programs from the command line by using 
the open command, so "open foo.app" will do the same thing as double 
clicking on foo in the finder (the .app extension is suppressed).  The 
idea behind this is that an application can look like just one opaque 
icon in the finder but actually have all its resources nicely organized 
in subfolders.
.. @+node:ekr.20110527084258.18374: *4* Summary of the Ashland sprint
http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/9b1dbebd56d50e14/d5a690127ddad38e
 
"Sprint" isn't really the correct term.  We wrote no code.  Instead,
we discussed what seemed to each of us as the most important
directions for Leo.

After much pleasant discussion, we reached agreement, dreaded or not,
on just about everything. I'll summarize the topics here, and
elaborate about file format issues in a separate thread.

1.  (Done) Make .leo files as standards-compliant as possible.

This will demonstrate to newbies that we have some sophistication re
web standards, and it will allow external tools to handle .leo files
in the easiest possible way.

I've delegated the design of this project to Kent.  I'll be in charge
of implementation.

2. Simplify and revise Leo's file format.

Details in a separate thread: some items deserve just a bit more
discussion.  In particular, we want the about-to-be-renamed <t>
elements to contain headline text so that <t> elements represent key/
value pairs directly.  The question is, should the about-to-be-renamed
<v> elements contain headline text (readable, but "denormalized")?

3. Support reading and writing Leo outlines in JSON format.

This will allow closer cooperation with databases and other tools.
I'll do this.

4. Complete the transition to Terry's free_layout plugin.

A. Place separate body editors in free_layout areas.  This should
*easy* to do!  Almost nothing changes in the code, but the visual
effect should be much better.

B. Allow any pane to be "tabified" (placed in a tab in the Log pane)
and "untabified."  There are a few details to be handled, but nothing
major.

Terry and I will collaborate on this.

5. Add global search to the quicksearch plugin and to Leo's find
command.

6. (Abandoned) Add node-specific undo asap.

The present undo is almost useless after a few levels.  Node-specific
undo would be much more useful. This has been on the list forever.  It
should be done yesterday.

7.  Rejected direct support for .ini files instead of Leo's @settings
nodes.

After some discussion we decided that the present .ini importer should
suffice.  In other words, it seems like a bad idea to support .ini
settings *instead* of, or in *addition* to, .ini files.  However,
scripts or commands to import/export Leo settings to one or more .ini
files would be fine.

8.  (done) Make uA's first class citizens.

There should be commands to get and set uA's.  This is easy to do:
it's just an oversight.

Summary
=======

Looking back on the discussions, I am struck once again by how minor
the suggestions are.  Most of these items can be done in a day or two,
or a week or two at most.  The conclusion is that Leo has reached a
mature state.

Kent, Terry, did I omit anything?  Misstate anything? 
.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16585: *4* Theory of operation for @auto-view
@language rest


.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16586: *5* Distinction: bare and nested organizers
Two major new Aha's have appeared. As often happens, they were the result
of a new distinction:

  **Nested** organizer nodes will become children of *other* organizer nodes.

  **Bare** organizer nodes will become children of *ordinary* nodes.
.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16587: *5* Two Ahas re nested organizers
Aha 1: We don't have to compute child indices for nodes moved to children
of organizer nodes!

We simply put them on a list (in imported outline order) of tuples
(parent,moved_node). There will be only *one* such list, say
vc.global_moved_node_list.

When the time comes to do the actual moves, we do the following:

- Reverse the global list, thereby guaranteeing that positions that appear
   later in the reversed list remain valid.
- Insert each item on the list as the *last* child of the parent
   (organizer) node.
   
​There is a small, easily corrected, hole in this argument. It assumes that
positions appear in the list in outline order. That's usually so, but not
always. Indeed, @organizer: nodes *are* written in outline order, as are
their contents, but rearrangements in the imported outline could
conceivably mean that the nodes corresponding to @organizer nodes would not
be handled in the *new* outline order. This is easily remedied: just sort
the list in (imported) outline order before reversing it

That's all!

Using a global list was hard to see, because typically such schemes don't
work in recursive environments. But the @auto-view algorithms are *not*
recursive. Each @organizer: node is handled separately, in a completely
linear fashion, by vc.demote_helper, the true main line of the code.

Aha 2:  We can treat *nested* organizer nodes just as we treat ordinary nodes!

vc.switch_active_organizer (the code that handles the entry into an
organizer node) will simply add another entry (parent,organizer_node) to
the global move list.

Not having to track most child indices is a major collapse in complexity.
Indeed, the code that moves nodes to their final destinations will have no
"if" statements at all. It doesn't get any more solid than that.
.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16588: *5* Moving bare organizers
===== Moving bare organizer nodes.

Now that moving most nodes has become trivial, the only remaining task is
to *safely* move bare organizers. This task has two parts:

1. Determine the proper child index of *bare* organizer nodes.

This will be done in the main line: vc.demote_helper will maintain a count
n of imported nodes that *haven't* been assigned to organizer nodes. This
count must also be incremented to include bare organizer nodes the will be
inserted later. It's just a bit tricky, but there are only a few cases to
get right. Once it works, it will work forever.

There will be another global list, say vc.global_bare_organizer_node_list,
containing tuples (parent,bare_organizer,n). vc.switch_active_organizer
will add entries to this list, but *only* for bare organizer nodes.

2. Actually move the bare organizer nodes.

The children of bare organizer nodes will appear vc.global_moved_node_list.
Each (ordinary) parent node may contain several bare organizer nodes. Here
is how to get the job done safely:

- For each parent, create a new per-parent list, containing all entries of
  the global list with that parent.
- Sort each per-parent list using n as the key.
- Move the nodes in each per-parent list to their destinations, in sorted
  order.

At first glace, this seems entirely bogus. How are we to ensure that
positions stay valid?

Unlike for ordinary nodes, we can't process bare organizer nodes in reverse
outline order: we have to handle them in the *new* sibling order, that is,
sorted by n. In other words, it won't work to move them to the last child
of their parent! Nor can we move nodes to any arbitrary sibling position:
we must move nodes with smaller child indices before moving nodes with
larger child indices.

To solve this problem, the setup code places each organizer node in a
separate **holding cell**. Moving the bare organizer out of a holding cell
to its final resting place affects no other holding cells, and no other
organizer node.


.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16589: *5* Intermediate organizers
This post contains important insights for both users and developers.

The symptom of the bugs is that *non-bare* organizer nodes are not placed
in correct sibling order. As you recall, the value of n in the main line,
demote_helper, matters only for *bare* organizer nodes. So the proximate
cause of the problem is that pending nodes aren't entered on the global
node list before entering the organizers.

As we shall see below, the more fundamental problem is that the code does
not fully account for the outline relationships between organizer nodes. As
a result, the existing code does not always open and close organizer nodes
properly. (An organizer node is open when it may accumulated organized
nodes; an organizer node is closed when it can no longer accumulate
organized nodes without changing the order of the nodes in the @auto file.)

Two examples will illustrate the subtleties, and will lead naturally to a
new distinction, that of an **intermediate organizer** node.

Let's start with an easy case.  Suppose the organizer structure is:

  - @auto x.py
    - leading nodes
    - organizer A
       - node 1
       - organizer B
           - node 2
       - organizer C
       - node 3
    - organizer D

Clearly, the children of organizer A should be: node1, organizer B,
organizer C and node 3. That is, we must *not* close organizer A just
because we have entered organizer B or organizer C. Otoh, we *must* close
organizer A when we see organizer D.

The rule is clear: we must close an organizer whenever we see another
organizer that is not a descendant organizer.

The existing code creates parent/child data for OrganizerData instances. It
will be straightforward to add descendant relationships.

Let's consider another case:

- @auto x.py
    - leading nodes
    - organizer A
       - organizer B
         - organizer C
           - node 1
 
Here, organizer B is an **intermediate organizer** node. That is, it occurs
"between" organizers A and C.

Adding node 1 to the global node list should open organizer B, but the
present code does not. The present code opens an organizer node only when
adding a node to the organizer, but this example shows that organizer B
must be added to the global node list *before* any node is added to it.
Failure to do so results in organizer B being put in the wrong place.
.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16590: *5* Aha: organizers relationships are stable
As I was thinking about the outline relationships between organizer nodes,
I began to worry that minor changes to the imported @auto file might break
those relationships. In fact, the reverse is true: the relationships
between organizer nodes are *independent* of the @auto file!

The reason is simple: those relationships are created by the unl's in
@organizer: nodes in the .leo file. Furthermore, reorganizing the *outline*
will automatically update the unls in the @organizer nodes (in the @views
node) when the outline is saved. Thus, the *relationships* between
organizer nodes can never be broken by changes to the @auto node! This is
really important for users to know.

And there is more good news. Changing the contents of the @auto files can
indeed change the contents of organizer nodes, but the only way to totally
invalidate an organizer node is to change the *structural* relationships of
data in the @auto file. This almost never happens!

For example, if aClass is defined at the top level of the @auto file, then
the only way to invalidate the organizers that contain aClass or its
members is to move aClass so it is not a top-level node. But Leo's
importers will put aClass at the top level unless it becomes a nested class
in some other class! To repeat, this kind massive change to the context of
a class, function or method almost never happens.

In short, the links between unls (in @organizer: nodes) and imported
classes, methods and functions almost never break! This is truly great
news.
.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16591: *5* Summary
The following insights are important for users (and maintainers) to know:

- Changing an @auto file does not change the relationships between its
  organizer nodes in any way.
- Saving an outline automatically updates the relationships between
  organizer nodes.
- Unl's are much more stable than one might suppose: the *only* way to
  "break" organizer nodes is to change the fundamental relationships of
  classes, methods or functions in the imported @auto file. This almost
  *never* happens.
.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16592: *5* Headines are important
Headlines matter The unls will break if the headlines produced by *the
importer* don't match those unls. There are two cases to consider:

A. Section references. At present, Leo will abort the writing of an @auto
    tree that contains section references. Instead, Leo could write the
    expansion of the section reference. In practice, changing section
    definition nodes to ordinary nodes by hand isn't a big deal, but it
    would be nice for Leo to do that for the user.

B. Headlines for classes, methods and functions.

This is the important case. Most of my headlines look like x.y (z), where x
is some kind of indication of the class and y is the actual class, method
or function name and z is a optional comment. When converting from @file to
@auto *all* of the organizers will break unless the headline becomes just
"y".

Perhaps the best solution is to ask the importer what name it will give to
the node. Yes, this involves parsing the contents of the node. It will
likely require a new interface method of the baseScannerClass.
.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16593: *5* Existing organizer nodes
There are *two* kinds of organizer nodes:

- those that do *not* exist in the imported outline (these now work).
- those that *do* exist in the imported outline.

For example, I usually put the helpers of method X as children of X. There
is *no way* for the read logic to recreate such nodes at present, because
the parent/child relationships are do not exist in the @auto file. So X is
an organizer node!

Happily, it should be relatively straightforward to support **existing
organizers**:

1. The write code will represent existing organizers with
    @existing-organizer: nodes rather than @organizer: nodes. As with
    @organizer: nodes, the headline will contain the headline of the
    organizer node; the body will be a list of unls.

The write code can easily discover existing organizers: they are nodes with
children that contain something other than comments and blank lines.

2. The read code will create OrganizerData entries for @existing-organizer
   nodes just as with @organizer: nodes. A new ivar, data.existing, will
   distinguish between @organizer: and @existing-organizer nodes. These new
   entries will be members of a new global list of all organizer nodes.

The goal will be to confine tests of data.existing to the setup code. That
way, all the hard code will continue to work as is. We shall see whether
this is possible.

3. The code that munges unls will drop unls for a data object only if
   data.existing is False. This may be more tricky than it sounds. In any
   case, this is the fundamental reason why @existing-organizer: nodes
   *must* exist.
.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16594: *5* Fixing move_nodes_to_organizers
@language rest

After several hours staring at traces, I realized that *all* the problems
were in vc.move_nodes_to_organizers. That is, vc.global_moved_node_list,
the global move node list, was completely correct! This was not obvious,
because that trace in vc.move_nodes_to_organizers reported the *sorted*
version of the global move list. Bad idea: it was the sorting itself that
was causing all the problems!

Recall that I thought sorting the list was required to keep positions
unchanged until they are moved. But an hour or so of experimentation (at
3am) convinced me that there is *no way* to move items from sorted lists
into the correct positions.

After a few minutes of noodling, the solution finally appeared. Rather than
*moving* nodes by moving positions, the *only* way that leaves
to-be-considered positions intact is to *copy* all the nodes of a
position's tree to the correct place. Eureka! A new method,
vc.copy_tree_to_last_child_of does the actual copying. A final phase in
vc.move_nodes_to_organizers deletes all positions in reverse outline order.
So yes, sorting *is* essential, but only at the very end.

Note: these difficulties do not apply to bare organizer nodes, because each
is placed in its own holding cell. But it's not possible to create holding
cells for non-bare organizers.

.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16595: *5* Supporting @existing-organizers
Recall that *existing* organizer nodes are organizer nodes that the
importer will have created. Last night, after everything worked, I
reconsidered the design of existing organizer nodes in the light of the new
code. I wondered whether the existing code would correctly move such nodes
into their correct final positions.

The short answer is yes, because the importer will *not* have created any
children for existing organizer nodes. That being so, everything is
*exactly* as it is for organizer nodes, except that demote_helper and its
helpers never need to create the organizer. Some complications may arise,
but I expect them all to be minor.
.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16596: *5* Supporting custom headlines (@headlines)
In a previous post I wrote the new @auto write code could just warn if a
headline has changed since the @auto file was read. Wrong! It would be
*unbearable* to have to lose custom headlines. The new code must save and
restore headlines that don't match the **standard headlines**, the
headlines that the importer will give the node the *next* time the importer
reads the @auto file.

A new @headlines node (a child of the @auto-view node for the @auto file)
will contain the required data. It will contain pairs of lines, much like
@clones::

    unl: <a unl>
    head: <the custom headline>

The unls in the @headlines node must use standard headlines! The "links"
created by @headlines node will break if the body text of a node changes so
as to change its standard headline. That is, @headlines links will break
when class, method or function names change.

To combat such breakage, whenever the body text of a node changes the code
that writes the @headlines node should *recompute* the unl using a
to-be-written convenience method in leoImport.py. The convenience method
will return the new standard headline.

.. @+node:ekr.20140212062130.16598: *5* Why the new code is solid
​1. The hard part of the code involves moving nodes.

vc.global_moved_node_list is the backbone of the entire algorithm.
vc.demote_helper and its helpers add items to the list. vc.move_nodes and
its helpers remove items from the list. Very few significant "if"
statements exist:

Both vc.demote_helper and vc.move_nodes_to_organizers (the hard part of
vc.move_nodes) are straightforward. Very few if statements exist:

- The "main switch" in demote_helper is likely already correct and will
  have only localized consequences

- The single "if" statement in vc.move_nodes_to_organizers (the hard part
  of vc.move_nodes) reflects the fundamental distinction: nodes that must
  be copied vs. nodes that can be moved immediately.

2. Newly-installed traces make it clear what is happening.

This is surprisingly important. If bugs exist, it will be easy to recreate
them using unit tests that show, in compact, easy-to-understand dumps,
exactly what is happening.

3. Everything is easy after nodes have been moved.

Just for example, remembering nodes initial (standard) headlines is easy:
just create a dict whose keys are *vnodes* and whose values are the
standard headlines. A node's vnode does not change when the node moves, so
complications in the node-moving algorithm have *no* effect.

In short, only the node-moving algorithm (on both "sides" of the global
move list) has any potential for nasty bugs. The vast majority of those
bugs are gone, and will be easily fixed if any remain. Everything else is
completely routine bookkeeping.

4. Minimizing "if" statements.

I've worked hard to make all code as simple as possible.

'''
The main line of the @auto-view algorithm. Traverse root's entire tree,
placing items on the global work list.

About the algorithm:

Moving *any* kind of node to an *ordinary* (non-existing) organizer is
easy: each node is moved to the last child of the organizer.

Moving nodes to *existing* organizers requires exact housekeeping. This
code must know at what child index to insert a node.

Terminology:
- p is the to-be-moved node.
- a(p) is p's **anchor**, an existing node.  a(p) == p.parent(). 
- o(p) be the *existing* organizer to which p will be moved as a child.  
- d is the global **offset dict**, vc.anchor_offset_d.

There are two cases to consider when moving a node p to an existing node:

Existing organizer case 1: p is *any kind* of existing node (organizer or not).

We insert p as the n'th child of o, where:

    n = p.childIndex() + d.get(p.parent(),0)

Existing organizer case 2: p is an non-existing node.

p must be an organizer node (because it doesn't exist) and it must be a
*bare* organizer node because o(p) is an existing organizer.

Let p2 be the (existing) node that causes p to be inserted.

We insert p as the n'th child of o(p), where:

    n = p2.childIndex() + d.get(p2.parent(),0)

The only remaining part of the puzzle is calculating the offsets, that is,
the entries in d. The simplifying insights:

Insight 1: We only calculate offsets for *existing* nodes.

Insight 2: Because the organizer exists in this case,
           the anchor is the existing organizer: a(p) == o(p)

Insight 3. Only inserting or deleting nodes from existing node can change offsets.

With these insights firmly in mind we can consider the following offset
cases:

Offset case 1: visiting existing children of existing organizers.

By definition, the importer will create children of existing organizers.
These nodes must *not* be moved: they are already in their correct spots!

Offset case 2: adding a non-existing organizer node p to any existing (organizer) node o:

This case adds one to d.get(o)

Offset case 3: moving an existing node p to *any* organizer node, existing or not.

This case subtracts one from d.get(p.parent())
'''

# Note: o may be:
# - a bare (ordinary) organizer node,
# - an ordinary organizer node,
# - a bare existing organizer node
# - an existing organizer node that is a child of another organizer node.

Very interesting indeed - great work! 

I didn't have Java/Jython installed so for others in the same boat here's
what I had to do to get it work on my platform (Win2k). Some of this is in
the README but I had to do some extra but I'm not sure why.

1. Install 1.5 JDK  
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp 

2. Install Jython 
http://www.jython.org/jython22a1.zip 

3. Edit Jython.bat file - the part that calls Java.exe to ... 
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02\jre\bin\java" -cp "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02\jre\lib";"c:\Apps\Python23\Jython";"C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15\Icons";"C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15\skins";"C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15\src";"C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15\skinimages" -Dpython.home="c:\Apps\Python23\Jython" -jar jython.jar %ARGS% 

Where  
- Java installed at C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02 
- Jython at c:\Apps\Python23\Jython 
- jLeo at C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15 

Change your paths as appropriate! There must be a better way to do this - Java confuses me! 

4. Edit leo.py in jleo/src directory to fix failure to find HOME env variable. 

line 241 becomes ... 

....try:home = os.getenv('HOME' )#,default=dotDir) 
....except KeyError:home="" 


Then, from the Jython install directory ... 

Jython " 
C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15\src\leo.py" 

Works a treat!

should be sufficient to start it up.
* new editor colorization
* the JythonShell is much more powerful and cooler
* new plugins
* Chapters support
* mod_script is in place.

* multi-language script support.
* drag and drop
* some powerful new editor commands.  Try keyword completing on the language

Some warnings:
1. Be careful about reading your regular leo files into jyleo and saving them.
Its quite conceivable that jyleo will write it out to an XML format that regular
leo can't handle.  Why?  Well jyleo is using an XML library to spit its XML
out while leo uses a home grown method.  The library can handle leo's XML, but
Ive seen regular leo not be able to handle jyleo's XML.  Its based around <tag/>
I believe.

2. If you move jyleo after executing it you will need to clear out your compiled
py files as the __file__ attribute is hard compiled into the resulting objects.
Not what we want.  We want it to be set at runtime.  Ive been waiting a long
time for jython to release again and hopefully fix this, but Im not holding
my breath anymore.

----------
Its hard to give this thing a number, I want to call it jyleo2, but jyleo is
sufficient.  Dependent upon bug reports the next release could be much sooner
than before, maybe even weeks.  I hope one thing, that the dreaded "I can't
get it to start" problems are gone.  I took the snapshot and expanded it in
Windows XP.  Went to the src directory and typed: jython leo.py
and it started.  That's what I wanted to see.  I didn't have to mess with the
CLASSPATH or anything.

things needed:
java 5
a jython2.2a1 or beyond.  jython2.2a1 is the most recent snapshot.

Beyond bug fixing, I will be planning to add more SwingMacs command as time
goes along.  But I think most major features are in place.  Of course the 3D
experiments in the future could change that... :D

A NOTE ON STARTUP TIMES: In my experience it takes awhile for jyleo to start.
It will take much longer the first time you execute it because the py files
are being compiled.  Ive haven't been able to figure out what eats the time,
it may just have a slow startup in the aggregate.  So don't think its not doing
anything, it probably is.

Conversions

Whenever Emacs Lisp calls Python functions giving them arguments, these arguments are Emacs Lisp structures that should be converted into Python objects in some way. Conversely, whenever Python calls Emacs Lisp functions, the arguments are Python objects that should be received as Emacs Lisp structures. We need some conventions for doing such conversions.

Conversions generally transmit mutable Emacs Lisp structures as mutable objects on the Python side, in such a way that transforming the object in Python will effectively transform the structure on the Emacs Lisp side (strings are handled a bit specially however, see below). The other way around, Python objects transmitted to Emacs Lisp often loose their mutability, so transforming the Emacs Lisp structure is not reflected on the Python side.

Pymacs sticks to standard Emacs Lisp, it explicitly avoids various Emacs Lisp extensions. One goal for many Pymacs users is taking some distance from Emacs Lisp, so Pymacs is not overly pushing users deeper into it.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103090504.3: *7* Simple objects
Simple objects

Emacs Lisp nil and the equivalent Emacs Lisp () yield Python None. Python None and the Python empty list [] are returned as nil in Emacs Lisp.

Emacs Lisp numbers, either integer or floating, are converted in equivalent Python numbers. Emacs Lisp characters are really numbers and yield Python numbers. In the other direction, Python numbers are converted into Emacs Lisp numbers, with the exception of long Python integers and complex numbers.

Emacs Lisp strings are usually converted into equivalent Python narrow strings. As Python strings do not have text properties, these are not reflected. This may be changed by setting the pymacs-mutable-strings option : if this variable is not nil, Emacs Lisp strings are then transmitted opaquely. Python strings, except Unicode, are always converted into Emacs Lisp strings.

Emacs Lisp symbols yield the special lisp.symbol or lisp[string] notations on the Python side. The first notation is used when the Emacs Lisp symbol starts with a letter, and contains only letters, digits and hyphens, in which case Emacs Lisp hyphens get replaced by Python underscores. This convention is welcome, as Emacs Lisp programmers commonly prefer using dashes, where Python programmers use underlines. Otherwise, the second notation is used. Conversely, lisp.symbol on the Python side yields an Emacs Lisp symbol with underscores replaced with hyphens, while lisp[string] corresponds to an Emacs Lisp symbol printed with that string which, of course, should then be a valid Emacs Lisp symbol name.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103090504.4: *7* Sequences
Sequences

The case of strings has been discussed in the previous section.

Proper Emacs Lisp lists, those for which the cdr of last cell is nil, are normally transmitted opaquely to Python. If pymacs-forget-mutability is set, or if Python later asks for these to be expanded, proper Emacs Lisp lists get converted into Python lists, if we except the empty list, which is always converted as Python None. In the other direction, Python lists are always converted into proper Emacs Lisp lists.

Emacs Lisp vectors are normally transmitted opaquely to Python. However, if pymacs-forget-mutability is set, or if Python later asks for these to be expanded, Emacs Lisp vectors get converted into Python tuples. In the other direction, Python tuples are always converted into Emacs Lisp vectors.

Remember the rule : Round parentheses correspond to square brackets!. It works for lists, vectors, tuples, seen from either Emacs Lisp or Python.

The above choices were debatable. Since Emacs Lisp proper lists and Python lists are the bread-and-butter of algorithms modifying structures, at least in my experience, I guess they are more naturally mapped into one another, this spares many casts in practice. While in Python, the most usual idiom for growing lists is appending to their end, the most usual idiom in Emacs Lisp to grow a list is by cons'ing new items at its beginning :

     (setq accumulator (cons 'new-item accumulator))


or more simply :

     (push 'new-item accumulator)


So, in case speed is especially important and many modifications happen in a row on the same side, while order of elements ought to be preserved, some (nreverse ...) on the Emacs Lisp side or .reverse() on the Python side side might be needed. Surely, proper lists in Emacs Lisp and lists in Python are the normal structure for which length is easily modified.

We cannot so easily change the size of a vector, the same as it is a bit more of a stunt to modify a tuple. The shape of these objects is fixed. Mapping vectors to tuples, which is admittedly strange, will only be done if the Python side requests an expanded copy, otherwise an opaque Emacs Lisp object is seen in Python. In the other direction, whenever an Emacs Lisp vector is needed, one has to write tuple(python_list) while transmitting the object. Such transmissions are most probably to be unusual, as people are not going to blindly transmit whole big structures back and forth between Emacs and Python, they would rather do it once in a while only, and do only local modifications afterwards. The infrequent casting to tuple for getting an Emacs Lisp vector seems to suggest that we did a reasonable compromise.

In Python, both tuples and lists have O(1) access, so there is no real speed consideration there. Emacs Lisp is different : vectors have O(1) access while lists have O(N) access. The rigidity of Emacs Lisp vectors is such that people do not resort to vectors unless there is a speed issue, so in real Emacs Lisp practice, vectors are used rather parsimoniously. So much, in fact, that Emacs Lisp vectors are overloaded for what they are not meant : for example, very small vectors are used to represent X events in key-maps, programmers only want to test vectors for their type, or users just like bracketed syntax. The speed of access is hardly an issue then.

.. @+node:ekr.20071103090504.6: *7* Emacs lisp handles
Emacs Lisp handles

When a Python function is called from Emacs Lisp, the function arguments have already been converted to Python types from Emacs Lisp types and the function result is going to be converted back to Emacs Lisp.

Several Emacs Lisp objects do not have Python equivalents, like for Emacs windows, buffers, markers, overlays, etc. It is nevertheless useful to pass them to Python functions, hoping that these Python functions will operate on these Emacs Lisp objects. Of course, the Python side may not itself modify such objects, it has to call for Emacs services to do so. Emacs Lisp handles are a mean to ease this communication.

Whenever an Emacs Lisp object may not be converted to a Python object, an Emacs Lisp handle is created and used instead. Whenever that Emacs Lisp handle is returned into Emacs Lisp from a Python function, or is used as an argument to an Emacs Lisp function from Python, the original Emacs Lisp object behind the Emacs Lisp handle is automatically retrieved.

Emacs Lisp handles are either instances of the internal Lisp class, or of one of its subclasses. If object is an Emacs Lisp handle, and if the underlying Emacs Lisp object is an Emacs Lisp sequence, then whenever object[index], object[index] = value and len(object) are meaningful, these may be used to fetch or alter an element of the sequence directly in Emacs Lisp space. Also, if object corresponds to an Emacs Lisp function, object(arguments) may be used to apply the Emacs Lisp function over the given arguments. Since arguments have been evaluated the Python way on the Python side, it would be conceptual overkill evaluating them again the Emacs Lisp way on the Emacs Lisp side, so Pymacs manage to quote arguments for defeating Emacs Lisp evaluation. The same logic applies the other way around.

Emacs Lisp handles have a value() method, which merely returns self. They also have a copy() method, which tries to open the box if possible. Emacs Lisp proper lists are turned into Python lists, Emacs Lisp vectors are turned into Python tuples. Then, modifying the structure of the copy on the Python side has no effect on the Emacs Lisp side.

For Emacs Lisp handles, str() returns an Emacs Lisp representation of the handle which should be eq to the original object if read back and evaluated in Emacs Lisp. repr() returns a Python representation of the expanded Emacs Lisp object. If that Emacs Lisp object has an Emacs Lisp representation which Emacs Lisp could read back, then repr() value is such that it could be read back and evaluated in Python as well, this would result in another object which is equal to the original, but not neccessarily eq.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103090504.7: *7* Python handles
Python handles

The same as Emacs Lisp handles are useful for handling Emacs Lisp objects on the Python side, Python handles are useful for handling Python objects on the Emacs Lisp side.

Many Python objects do not have direct Emacs Lisp equivalents, including long integers, complex numbers, Unicode strings, modules, classes, instances and surely a lot of others. When such are being transmitted to the Emacs Lisp side, Pymacs use Python handles. These are automatically recovered into the original Python objects whenever transmitted back to Python, either as arguments to a Python function, as the Python function itself, or as the return value of an Emacs Lisp function called from Python.

The objects represented by these Python handles may be inspected or modified using the basic library of Python functions. For example, in :

     (setq matcher (pymacs-eval "re.compile('pattern').match"))
     (pymacs-call matcher argument)


the initial setq above could be decomposed into :

           (setq compiled (pymacs-eval "re.compile('pattern')")
            matcher (pymacs-call "getattr" compiled "match"))


This example shows that one may use pymacs-call with getattr as the function, to get a wanted attribute for a Python object.

.. @+node:ekr.20071103090504.9: *7* pymacs-eval/apply

pymacs-eval

Function (pymacs-eval text) gets text evaluated as a Python expression, and returns the value of that expression converted back to Emacs Lisp.

pymacs-call

Function (pymacs-call function argument...) will get Python to apply the given function over zero or more argument. function is either a string holding Python source code for a function (like a mere name, or even an expression), or else, a Python handle previously received from Python, and hopefully holding a callable Python object. Each argument gets separately converted to Python before the function is called. pymacs-call returns the resulting value of the function call, converted back to Emacs Lisp.

pymacs-apply

Function (pymacs-apply function arguments) will get Python to apply the given function over the given arguments. arguments is a list containing all arguments, or nil if there is none. Besides arguments being bundled together instead of given separately, the function acts pretty much like pymacs-call.

We do not expect that pymacs-eval, pymacs-call or pymacs-apply will be much used, if ever. In practice, the Emacs Lisp side of a Pymacs application might call pymacs-load a few times for linking into the Python modules, with the indirect effect of defining trampoline functions for these modules on the Emacs Lisp side, which can later be called like usual Emacs Lisp functions.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103090504.10: *7* pymacs-load
pymacs-load

Function (pymacs-load module prefix) imports the Python module into Emacs Lisp space.

module is the name of the file containing the module, without any .py or .pyc extension. If the directory part is omitted in module, the module will be looked into the current Python search path. Dot notation may be used when the module is part of a package. Each top-level function in the module produces a trampoline function in Emacs Lisp having the same name, except that underlines in Python names are turned into dashes in Emacs Lisp, and that prefix is uniformly added before the Emacs Lisp name (as a way to avoid name clashes).

prefix may be omitted, in which case it defaults to base name of module with underlines turned into dashes, and followed by a dash.

Whenever pymacs_load_hook is defined in the loaded Python module, pymacs-load calls it without arguments, but before creating the Emacs view for that module. So, the pymacs_load_hook function may create new definitions or even add interaction attributes to functions.

The return value of a successful pymacs-load is the module object. An optional third argument, noerror, when given and not nil, will have pymacs-load to return nil instead of raising an error, if the Python module could not be found.

When later calling one of these trampoline functions, all provided arguments are converted to Python and transmitted, and the function return value is later converted back to Emacs Lisp. It is left to the Python side to check for argument consistency. However, for an interactive function, the interaction specification drives some checking on the Emacs Lisp side. Currently, there is no provision for collecting keyword arguments in Emacs Lisp.

Pymacs requires little or no setup in the Python modules which are meant to be used from Emacs, for the simple situations where these modules receive nothing but Emacs nil, numbers or strings, or return nothing but Python None, numbers or strings.

Otherwise, use from Pymacs import lisp. If you need more Pymacs features, like the Let class, write from Pymacs import lisp, Let.

Response mode

When Python receives a request from Emacs in the context of Pymacs, and until it returns the reply, Emacs keeps listening to serve Python requests. Emacs is not listening otherwise. Other Python threads, if any, may not call Emacs without very careful synchronisation.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103091052.3: *7* Emacs lisp symbols
Emacs Lisp symbols

lisp is a special object which has useful built-in magic. Its attributes do nothing but represent Emacs Lisp symbols, created on the fly as needed (symbols also have their built-in magic).

lisp.nil or lisp["nil"], are the same as None.

Otherwise, lisp.symbol and lisp[string] yield objects of the internal Symbol type. These are genuine Python objects, that could be referred to by simple Python variables. One may write quote = lisp.quote, for example, and use quote afterwards to mean that Emacs Lisp symbol. If a Python function received an Emacs Lisp symbol as an argument, it can check with == if that argument is lisp.never or lisp.ask, say. A Python function may well choose to return lisp.t.

In Python, writing lisp.symbol = value or lisp[string] = value does assign value to the corresponding symbol in Emacs Lisp space. Beware that in such cases, the lisp. prefix may not be [omitted] spared. After result = lisp.result, one cannot hope that a later result = 3 will have any effect in the Emacs Lisp space : this would merely change the Python variable result, which was a reference to a Symbol instance, so it is now a reference to the number 3.

The Symbol class has value() and copy() methods. One can use either lisp.symbol.value() or lisp.symbol.copy() to access the Emacs Lisp value of a symbol, after conversion to some Python object, of course. However, if value() would have given an Emacs Lisp handle, lisp.symbol.copy() has the effect of lisp.symbol.value().copy(), that is, it returns the value of the symbol as opened as possible.

A symbol may also be used as if it was a Python function, in which case it really names an Emacs Lisp function that should be applied over the following function arguments. The result of the Emacs Lisp function becomes the value of the call, with all due conversions of course.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103091052.4: *7* Dynamic bindings (The let class)
Dynamic bindings

As Emacs Lisp uses dynamic bindings, it is common that Emacs Lisp programs use
let for temporarily setting new values for some Emacs Lisp variables having
global scope. These variables recover their previous value automatically when
the let gets completed, even if an error occurs which interrupts the normal flow
of execution.

Pymacs has a Let class to represent such temporary settings. Suppose for example
that you want to recover the value of lisp.mark() when the transient mark mode
is active on the Emacs Lisp side. One could surely use lisp.mark(lisp.t) to
force reading the mark in such cases, but for the sake of illustration, let's
ignore that, and temporarily deactivate transient mark mode instead. This could
be done this way :

        try :
        let = Let()
        let.push(transient_mark_mode=None)
        ... user code ...
        finally :
        let.pop()

let.push() accepts any number of keywords arguments. Each keyword name is
interpreted as an Emacs Lisp symbol written the Pymacs way, with underlines. The
value of that Emacs Lisp symbol is saved on the Python side, and the value of
the keyword becomes the new temporary value for this Emacs Lisp symbol. A later
let.pop() restores the previous value for all symbols which were saved together
at the time of the corresponding let.push(). There may be more than one
let.push() call for a single Let instance, they stack within that instance. Each
let.pop() will undo one and only one let.push() from the stack, in the reverse
order or the pushes.

When the Let instance disappears, either because the programmer does del let or
let = None, or just because the Python let variable goes out of scope, all
remaining let.pop() get automatically executed, so the try/finally statement may
be omitted in practice. For this omission to work flawlessly, the programmer
should be careful at not keeping extra references to the Let instance.

The constructor call let = Let() also has an implied initial .push() over all
given arguments, so the explicit let.push() may be omitted as well. In practice,
this sums up and the above code could be reduced to a mere :

     let = Let(transient_mark_mode=None)
     ... user code ...

Be careful at assigning the result of the constructor to some Python variable.
Otherwise, the instance would disappear immediately after having been created,
restoring the Emacs Lisp variable much too soon.

Any variable to be bound with Let should have been bound in advance on the Emacs
Lisp side. This restriction usually does no kind of harm. Yet, it will likely be
lifted in some later version of Pymacs.

The Let class has other methods meant for some macros which are common in Emacs
Lisp programming, in the spirit of let bindings. These method names look like
push_* or pop_*, where Emacs Lisp macros are save-*. One has to use the matching
pop_* for undoing the effect of a given push_* rather than a mere .pop() : the
Python code is clearer, this also ensures that things are undone in the proper
order. The same Let instance may use many push_* methods, their effects nest.

push_excursion() and pop_excursion() save and restore the current buffer, point
and mark. push_match_data() and pop_match_data() save and restore the state of
the last regular expression match. push_restriction() and pop_restriction() save
and restore the current narrowing limits. push_selected_window() and
pop_selected_window() save and restore the fact that a window holds the cursor.
push_window_excursion() and pop_window_excursion() save and restore the current
window configuration in the Emacs display.

As a convenience, let.push() and all other push_* methods return the Let
instance. This helps chaining various push_* right after the instance
generation. For example, one may write :

         let = Let().push_excursion()
         if True :
         ... user code ...
         del let

The if True: (use if 1: with older Python releases, some people might prefer
writing if let: anyway), has the only goal of indenting user code, so the scope
of the let variable is made very explicit. This is purely stylistic, and not at
all necessary. The last del let might be omitted in a few circumstances, for
example if the excursion lasts until the end of the Python function.

Raw Emacs Lisp expressions

Pymacs offers a device for evaluating a raw Emacs Lisp expression, or a sequence of such, expressed as a string. One merely uses lisp as a function, like this :

     lisp("""
     ...
     possibly-long-sequence-of-lisp-expressions
     ...
     """)


The Emacs Lisp value of the last or only expression in the sequence becomes the value of the lisp call, after conversion back to Python.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103091052.6: *7* User interaction
User interaction

Emacs functions have the concept of user interaction for completing the specification of their arguments while being called. This happens only when a function is interactively called by the user, it does not happen when a function is programmatically called by another. As Python does not have a corresponding facility, a bit of trickery was needed to retrofit that facility on the Python side.

After loading a Python module but prior to creating an Emacs view for this
module, Pymacs decides whether loaded functions will be interactively callable
from Emacs, or not. Whenever a function has an interaction attribute, this
attribute holds the Emacs interaction specification for this function. The
specification is either another Python function or a string. In the former case,
that other function is called without arguments and should, maybe after having
consulted the user, return a list of the actual arguments to be used for the
original function. In the latter case, the specification string is used verbatim
as the argument to the (interactive ...) function on the Emacs side. To get a
short reminder about how this string is interpreted on the Emacs side, try C-h f
interactive within Emacs. Here is an example where an empty string is used to
specify that an interactive has no arguments::

    from Pymacs import lisp

    def hello_world() :
        "`Hello world' from Python."
        lisp.insert("Hello from Python!")
        hello_world.interaction = ''

Versions of Python released before the integration of PEP 232 do not allow users
to add attributes to functions, so there is a fallback mechanism. Let's presume
that a given function does not have an interaction attribute as explained above.
If the Python module contains an interactions global variable which is a
dictionary, if that dictionary has an entry for the given function with a value
other than None, that function is going to be interactive on the Emacs side.
Here is how the preceeding example should be written for an older version of
Python, or when portability is at premium::

    from Pymacs import lisp
    interactions = {}

    def hello_world() :
        "`Hello world' from Python."
        lisp.insert("Hello from Python!")
        interactions[hello_world] = ''

One might wonder why we do not merely use lisp.interactive(...) from within
Python. There is some magic in the Emacs Lisp interpreter itself, looking for
that call before the function is actually entered, this explains why
(interactive ...) has to appear first in an Emacs Lisp defun. Pymacs could try
to scan the already compiled form of the Python code, seeking for
lisp.interactive, but as the evaluation of lisp.interactive arguments could get
arbitrarily complex, it would a real challenge un-compiling that evaluation into
Emacs Lisp.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103091052.7: *7* Key bindings
Keybindings

An interactive function may be bound to a key sequence.

To translate bindings like C-x w, say, one might have to know a bit more how
Emacs Lisp processes string escapes like \C-x or \M-\C-x in Emacs Lisp, and
emulate it within Python strings, since Python does not have such escapes. \C-L,
where L is an upper case letter, produces a character which ordinal is the
result of subtracting 0x40 from ordinal of L. \M- has the ordinal one gets by
adding 0x80 to the ordinal of following described character. So people can use
self-inserting non-ASCII characters, \M- is given another representation, which
is to replace the addition of 0x80 by prefixing with `ESC', that is 0x1b.

So \C-x in Emacs is '\x18' in Python. This is easily found, using an interactive
Python session, by givin it : chr(ord('X') - ord('A') + 1). An easier way would
be using the kbd function on the Emacs Lisp side, like with lisp.kbd('C-x w') or
lisp.kbd('M-<f2>').

To bind the F1 key to the helper function in some module :

     lisp.global_set_key((lisp.f1,), lisp.module_helper)

(item,) is a Python tuple yielding an Emacs Lisp vector. lisp.f1 translates to
the Emacs Lisp symbol f1. So, Python (lisp.f1,) is Emacs Lisp [f1]. Keys like
[M-f2] might require some more ingenuity, one may write either (lisp['M-f2'],)
or (lisp.M_f2,) on the Python side.

.. @+node:ekr.20071103092153.1: *7* The *pymacs* buffer
The *Pymacs* buffer

Emacs and Python are two separate processes (well, each may use more than one process). Pymacs implements a simple communication protocol between both, and does whatever needed so the programmers do not have to worry about details. The main debugging tool is the communication buffer between Emacs and Python, which is named *Pymacs*. As it is sometimes helpful to understand the communication protocol, it is briefly explained here, using an artificially complex example to do so. Consider :

     (pymacs-eval "lisp('(pymacs-eval \"`2L**111`\")')")
     "2596148429267413814265248164610048L"

Here, Emacs asks Python to ask Emacs to ask Python for a simple bignum computation. Note that Emacs does not natively know how to handle big integers, nor has an internal representation for them. This is why I use backticks, so Python returns a string representation of the result, instead of the result itself. Here is a trace for this example. The < character flags a message going from Python to Emacs and is followed by an expression written in Emacs Lisp. The > character flags a message going from Emacs to Python and is followed by a expression written in Python. The number gives the length of the message.

     <22   (pymacs-version "0.3")
     >49   eval("lisp('(pymacs-eval \"`2L**111`\")')")
     <25   (pymacs-eval "`2L**111`")
     >18   eval("`2L**111`")
     <47   (pymacs-reply "2596148429267413814265248164610048L")
     >45   reply("2596148429267413814265248164610048L")
     <47   (pymacs-reply "2596148429267413814265248164610048L")

Python evaluation is done in the context of the Pymacs.pymacs module, so for example a mere reply really means Pymacs.pymacs.reply. On the Emacs Lisp side, there is no concept of module namespaces, so we use the pymacs- prefix as an attempt to stay clean. Users should ideally refrain from naming their Emacs Lisp objects with a pymacs- prefix.

reply and pymacs-reply are special functions meant to indicate that an expected result is finally transmitted. error and pymacs-error are special functions that introduce a string which explains an exception which recently occurred. pymacs-expand is a special function implementing the copy() methods of Emacs Lisp handles or symbols. In all other cases, the expression is a request for the other side, that request stacks until a corresponding reply is received.

Part of the protocol manages memory, and this management generates some extra-noise in the *Pymacs* buffer. Whenever Emacs passes a structure to Python, an extra pointer is generated on the Emacs side to inhibit garbage collection by Emacs. Python garbage collector detects when the received structure is no longer needed on the Python side, at which time the next communication will tell Emacs to remove the extra pointer. It works symmetrically as well, that is, whenever Python passes a structure to Emacs, an extra Python reference is generated to inhibit garbage collection on the Python side. Emacs garbage collector detects when the received structure is no longer needed on the Emacs side, after which Python will be told to remove the extra reference. For efficiency, those allocation-related messages are delayed, merged and batched together within the next communication having another purpose.

Variable pymacs-trace-transit may be modified for controlling how and when the *Pymacs* buffer, or parts thereof, get erased.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103092153.2: *7* Usual Emacs debugging
Emacs usual debugging

If cross-calls between Emacs Lisp and Python nest deeply, an error will raise
successive exceptions alternatively on both sides as requests unstack, and the
diagnostic gets transmitted back and forth, slightly growing as we go. So,
errors will eventually be reported by Emacs. I made no kind of effort to
transmit the Emacs Lisp backtrace on the Python side, as I do not see a purpose
for it : all debugging is done within Emacs windows anyway.

On recent Emacses, the Python backtrace gets displayed in the mini-buffer, and
the Emacs Lisp backtrace is simultaneously shown in the *Backtrace* window. One
useful thing is to allow to mini-buffer to grow big, so it has more chance to
fully contain the Python backtrace, the last lines of which are often especially
useful. Here, I use :

         (setq resize-mini-windows t
          max-mini-window-height .85)

in my .emacs file, so the mini-buffer may use 85% of the screen, and quickly
shrinks when fewer lines are needed. The mini-buffer contents disappear at the
next keystroke, but you can recover the Python backtrace by looking at the end
of the *Messages* buffer. In which case the ffap package in Emacs may be yet
another friend! From the *Messages* buffer, once ffap activated, merely put the
cursor on the file name of a Python module from the backtrace, and C-x C-f RET
will quickly open that source for you.

Auto-reloading on save

I found useful to automatically pymacs-load some Python files whenever they get

following lines at the end :

     # Local Variables :

For comments held within boxes, it is painful to fill paragraphs, while
stretching or shrinking the surrounding box by hand, as needed. This piece of
Python code eases my life on this. It may be used interactively from within
Emacs through the Pymacs interface, or in batch as a script which filters a
single region to be reformatted.

In batch mode, the reboxing is driven by command options and arguments and expects a
complete, self-contained boxed comment from a file.

Emacs function rebox-region also presumes that the region encloses a single
boxed comment.

Emacs rebox-comment is different, as it has to chase itself the extent of the
surrounding boxed comment.

.. @+node:ekr.20071103094355: *7* The python side
Design notes for rebox.py:

Pymacs specific features are used exclusively from within the pymacs_load_hook
function and the Emacs_Rebox class. In batch mode, Pymacs is not even imported.

In batch mode, as well as with rebox-region, the text to handle is turned over
to Python, and fully processed in Python, with practically no Pymacs interaction
while the work gets done. On the other hand, rebox-comment is rather Pymacs
intensive: the comment boundaries are chased right from the Emacs buffer, as
directed by the function Emacs_Rebox.find_comment. Once the boundaries are
found, the remainder of the work is essentially done on the Python side.

Once the boxed comment has been reformatted in Python, the old comment is
removed in a single delete operation, the new comment is inserted in a second
operation. This occurs in Emacs_Rebox.process_emacs_region. But by doing so, if
point was within the boxed comment before the reformatting, its precise position
is lost. To well preserve point, Python might have driven all reformatting
details directly in the Emacs buffer. We really preferred doing it all on the
Python side : as we gain legibility by expressing the algorithms in pure Python,
the same Python code may be used in batch or interactively, and we avoid the
slowdown that would result from heavy use of Emacs services.

To avoid completely loosing point, I kludged a Marker class, which goal is to
estimate the new value of point from the old. Reformatting may change the amount
of white space, and either delete or insert an arbitrary number characters meant
to draw the box. The idea is to initially count the number of characters between
the beginning of the region and point, while ignoring any problematic character.
Once the comment has been reboxed, point is advanced from the beginning of the
region until we get the same count of characters, skipping all problematic
characters. This Marker class works fully on the Python side, it does not
involve Pymacs at all, but it does solve a problem that resulted from my choice
of keeping the data on the Python side instead of handling it directly in the
Emacs buffer.

We want a comment reformatting to appear as a single operation, in the context
of Emacs Undo. The method Emacs_Rebox.clean_undo_after handles the general case
for this. Not that we do so much in practice : a reformatting implies one
delete-region and one insert, and maybe some other little adjustements at
Emacs_Rebox.find_comment time. Even if this method scans and mofifies an Emacs
Lisp list directly in the Emacs memory, the code doing this stays neat and
legible. However, I found out that the undo list may grow quickly when the Emacs
buffer use markers, with the consequence of making this routine so Pymacs
intensive that most of the CPU is spent there. I rewrote that routine in Emacs
Lisp so it executes in a single Pymacs interaction.

Function Emacs_Rebox.remainder_of_line could have been written in Python, but it
was probably not worth going away from this one-liner in Emacs Lisp. Also, given
this routine is often called by find_comment, a few Pymacs protocol interactions
are spared this way. This function is useful when there is a need to apply a
regexp already compiled on the Python side, it is probably better fetching the
line from Emacs and do the pattern match on the Python side, than transmitting
the source of the regexp to Emacs for it to compile and apply it.

For refilling, I could have either used the refill algorithm built within in
Emacs, programmed a new one in Python, or relied on Ross Paterson's fmt,
distributed by GNU and available on most Linuxes. In fact, refill_lines prefers
the latter. My own Emacs setup is such that the built-in refill algorithm is
already overridden by GNU fmt, and it really does a much better job. Experience
taught me that calling an external program is fast enough to be very bearable,
even interactively. If Python called Emacs to do the refilling, Emacs would
itself call GNU fmt in my case, I preferred that Python calls GNU fmt directly.
I could have reprogrammed GNU fmt in Python. Despite interesting, this is an
uneasy project : fmt implements the Knuth refilling algorithm, which depends on
dynamic programming techniques; Ross did carefully fine tune them, and took care
of many details. If GNU fmt fails, for not being available, say, refill_lines
falls back on a dumb refilling algorithm, which is better than none.
.. @+node:ekr.20071103094355.1: *7* The emacs side
For most Emacs language editing modes, refilling does not make sense
outside comments, one may redefine the `M-q' command and link it to this
Pymacs module.  For example, I use this in my `.emacs' file::

    (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'fp-c-mode-routine)
    (defun fp-c-mode-routine ()
        (local-set-key "\M-q" 'rebox-comment))
    (autoload 'rebox-comment "rebox" nil t)
    (autoload 'rebox-region "rebox" nil t)

with a "rebox.el" file having this single line:

    (pymacs-load "Pymacs.rebox")

The Emacs function `rebox-comment' automatically discovers the extent of the
boxed comment near the cursor, possibly refills the text, then adjusts the box
style. When this command is executed, the cursor should be within a comment, or
else it should be between two comments, in which case the command applies to the
next comment.

The Emacs function `rebox-region' does the same, except that it takes the
current region as a boxed comment. Both commands obey numeric prefixes to add or
remove a box, force a particular box style, or to prevent refilling of text.
Without such prefixes, the commands may deduce the current box style from the
comment itself so the style is preserved.

The default style initial value is nil or 0.  It may be preset to another
value through calling `rebox-set-default-style' from Emacs LISP, or changed
to anything else though using a negative value for a prefix, in which case
the default style is set to the absolute value of the prefix.

A `C-u' prefix avoids refilling the text, but forces using the default box
style.  `C-u -' lets the user interact to select one attribute at a time.

Adding new styles
-----------------

Let's suppose you want to add your own boxed comment style, say:

    //--------------------------------------------+
    // This is the style mandated in our company.
    //--------------------------------------------+

You might modify `rebox.py' but then, you will have to edit it whenever you
get a new release of `pybox.py'.  Emacs users might modify their `.emacs'
file or their `rebox.el' bootstrap, if they use one.  In either cases,
after the `(pymacs-load "Pymacs.rebox")' line, merely add:

    (rebox-Template NNN MMM ["//-----+"
                             "// box  "
                             "//-----+"])

In batch mode [If you use the `rebox' script rather than Emacs], the simplest is to make
your own.  This is easy, as it is very small.  For example, the above
style could be implemented by using this script instead of `rebox':

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import sys
    from Pymacs import rebox
    rebox.Template(226, 325, ('//-----+',
                              '// box  ',
                              '//-----+'))
    apply(rebox.main, tuple(sys.argv[1:]))

In all cases, NNN is the style three-digit number, with no zero digit.
Pick any free style number, you are safe with 911 and up.  MMM is the
recognition priority, only used to disambiguate the style of a given boxed
comments, when it matches many styles at once.  Try something like 400.
Raise or lower that number as needed if you observe false matches.

Usually, the template uses three lines of equal length.  Do not worry if
this implies a few trailing spaces, they will be cleaned up automatically
at box generation time.  The first line or the third line may be omitted
to create vertically opened boxes.  But the middle line may not be omitted,
it ought to include the word `box', which will get replaced by your actual
comment.  If the first line is shorter than the middle one, it gets merged
at the start of the comment.  If the last line is shorter than the middle
one, it gets merged at the end of the comment and is refilled with it.

"""\
Handling of boxed comments in various box styles.

Introduction
------------

For comments held within boxes, it is painful to fill paragraphs, while
stretching or shrinking the surrounding box "by hand", as needed.  This piece
of Python code eases my life on this.  It may be used interactively from
within Emacs through the Pymacs interface, or in batch as a script which
filters a single region to be reformatted.  I find only fair, while giving
all sources for a package using such boxed comments, to also give the
means I use for nicely modifying comments.  So here they are!

Box styles
----------

Each supported box style has a number associated with it.  This number is
arbitrary, yet by _convention_, it holds three non-zero digits such the the
hundreds digit roughly represents the programming language, the tens digit
roughly represents a box quality (or weight) and the units digit roughly
a box type (or figure).  An unboxed comment is merely one of box styles.
Language, quality and types are collectively referred to as style attributes.

When rebuilding a boxed comment, attributes are selected independently
of each other.  They may be specified by the digits of the value given
as Emacs commands argument prefix, or as the `-s' argument to the `rebox'
script when called from the shell.  If there is no such prefix, or if the
corresponding digit is zero, the attribute is taken from the value of the
default style instead.  If the corresponding digit of the default style
is also zero, than the attribute is recognised and taken from the actual
boxed comment, as it existed before prior to the command.  The value 1,
which is the simplest attribute, is ultimately taken if the parsing fails.

A programming language is associated with comment delimiters.  Values are
100 for none or unknown, 200 for `/*' and `*/' as in plain C, 300 for `//'
as in C++, 400 for `#' as in most scripting languages, 500 for `;' as in
LISP or assembler and 600 for `%' as in TeX or PostScript.

Box quality differs according to language. For unknown languages (100) or
for the C language (200), values are 10 for simple, 20 for rounded, and
30 or 40 for starred.  Simple quality boxes (10) use comment delimiters
to left and right of each comment line, and also for the top or bottom
line when applicable. Rounded quality boxes (20) try to suggest rounded
corners in boxes.  Starred quality boxes (40) mostly use a left margin of
asterisks or X'es, and use them also in box surroundings.  For all others
languages, box quality indicates the thickness in characters of the left
and right sides of the box: values are 10, 20, 30 or 40 for 1, 2, 3 or 4
characters wide.  With C++, quality 10 is not useful, it is not allowed.

Box type values are 1 for fully opened boxes for which boxing is done
only for the left and right but not for top or bottom, 2 for half
single lined boxes for which boxing is done on all sides except top,
3 for fully single lined boxes for which boxing is done on all sides,
4 for half double lined boxes which is like type 2 but more bold,
or 5 for fully double lined boxes which is like type 3 but more bold.

The special style 221 is for C comments between a single opening `/*'
and a single closing `*/'.  The special style 111 deletes a box.

Batch usage
-----------

Usage is `rebox [OPTION]... [FILE]'.  By default, FILE is reformatted to
standard output by refilling the comment up to column 79, while preserving
existing boxed comment style.  If FILE is not given, standard input is read.
Options may be:

  -n         Do not refill the comment inside its box, and ignore -w.
  -s STYLE   Replace box style according to STYLE, as explained above.
  -t         Replace initial sequence of spaces by TABs on each line.
  -v         Echo both the old and the new box styles on standard error.
  -w WIDTH   Try to avoid going over WIDTH columns per line.

So, a single boxed comment is reformatted by invocation.  `vi' users, for
example, would need to delimit the boxed comment first, before executing
the `!}rebox' command (is this correct? my `vi' recollection is far away).

Batch usage is also slow, as internal structures have to be reinitialised
at every call.  Producing a box in a single style is fast, but recognising
the previous style requires setting up for all possible styles.

Emacs usage
-----------

For most Emacs language editing modes, refilling does not make sense
outside comments, one may redefine the `M-q' command and link it to this
Pymacs module.  For example, I use this in my `.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'fp-c-mode-routine)
     (defun fp-c-mode-routine ()
       (local-set-key "\M-q" 'rebox-comment))
     (autoload 'rebox-comment "rebox" nil t)
     (autoload 'rebox-region "rebox" nil t)

with a "rebox.el" file having this single line:

     (pymacs-load "Pymacs.rebox")

Install Pymacs from `http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pinard/pymacs.tar.gz'.

The Emacs function `rebox-comment' automatically discovers the extent of
the boxed comment near the cursor, possibly refills the text, then adjusts
the box style.  When this command is executed, the cursor should be within
a comment, or else it should be between two comments, in which case the
command applies to the next comment.  The function `rebox-region' does
the same, except that it takes the current region as a boxed comment.
Both commands obey numeric prefixes to add or remove a box, force a
particular box style, or to prevent refilling of text.  Without such
prefixes, the commands may deduce the current box style from the comment
itself so the style is preserved.

The default style initial value is nil or 0.  It may be preset to another
value through calling `rebox-set-default-style' from Emacs LISP, or changed
to anything else though using a negative value for a prefix, in which case
the default style is set to the absolute value of the prefix.

A `C-u' prefix avoids refilling the text, but forces using the default box
style.  `C-u -' lets the user interact to select one attribute at a time.

Adding new styles
-----------------

Let's suppose you want to add your own boxed comment style, say:

    //--------------------------------------------+
    // This is the style mandated in our company.
    //--------------------------------------------+

You might modify `rebox.py' but then, you will have to edit it whenever you
get a new release of `pybox.py'.  Emacs users might modify their `.emacs'
file or their `rebox.el' bootstrap, if they use one.  In either cases,
after the `(pymacs-load "Pymacs.rebox")' line, merely add:

    (rebox-Template NNN MMM ["//-----+"
                             "// box  "
                             "//-----+"])

If you use the `rebox' script rather than Emacs, the simplest is to make
your own.  This is easy, as it is very small.  For example, the above
style could be implemented by using this script instead of `rebox':

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import sys
    from Pymacs import rebox
    rebox.Template(226, 325, ('//-----+',
                              '// box  ',
                              '//-----+'))
    apply(rebox.main, tuple(sys.argv[1:]))

In all cases, NNN is the style three-digit number, with no zero digit.
Pick any free style number, you are safe with 911 and up.  MMM is the
recognition priority, only used to disambiguate the style of a given boxed
comments, when it matches many styles at once.  Try something like 400.
Raise or lower that number as needed if you observe false matches.

On average, the template uses three lines of equal length.  Do not worry if
this implies a few trailing spaces, they will be cleaned up automatically
at box generation time.  The first line or the third line may be omitted
to create vertically opened boxes.  But the middle line may not be omitted,
it ought to include the word `box', which will get replaced by your actual
comment.  If the first line is shorter than the middle one, it gets merged
at the start of the comment.  If the last line is shorter than the middle
one, it gets merged at the end of the comment and is refilled with it.

History
-------

I first observed rounded corners, as in style 223 boxes, in code from
Warren Tucker, a previous maintainer of the `shar' package, circa 1980.

Except for very special files, I carefully avoided boxed comments for
real work, as I found them much too hard to maintain.  My friend Paul
Provost was working at Taarna, a computer graphics place, which had boxes
as part of their coding standards.  He asked that we try something to get
him out of his misery, and this how `rebox.el' was originally written.
I did not plan to use it for myself, but Paul was so enthusiastic that I
timidly started to use boxes in my things, very little at first, but more
and more as time passed, still in doubt that it was a good move.  Later,
many friends spontaneously started to use this tool for real, some being very
serious workers.  This convinced me that boxes are acceptable, after all.

I do not use boxes much with Python code.  It is so legible that boxing
is not that useful.  Vertical white space is less necessary, too.  I even
avoid white lines within functions.  Comments appear prominent enough when
using highlighting editors like Emacs or nice printer tools like `enscript'.

After Emacs could be extended with Python, in 2001, I translated `rebox.el'
into `rebox.py', and added the facility to use it as a batch script.

.. @+node:ekr.20130814140750.17192: *5* Ipython now has cell magic
From: Alia K <alia_khouri@yahoo.com>

Fernando Perez of IPython fame just announced recently that IPython
trunk has the cell magic functionality that was discussed earlier
[http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/
7d910a68072dda1/b14e84fc3cfddbf6?lnk=gst&q=ipython#b14e84fc3cfddbf6].
As this could work very nicely with leo as an ipython editor, I will
include his text verbatim here:

===== Fernando

I'm excited to report that we now have cell magics in IPython... PR
1732 [1] has just been merged [2], which implements the design
discussed in IPEP 1 [3]. This is probably one of the largest PRs we've
had so far, with over 100 commits, over 100 comments and a diff that's
almost 11000 lines long (a lot of it moving code around, obviously
it's not all new code).  But it brings two very important thigns:

1) a refactor of the magic system to finally remove the old mixin
class we'd had since the very first days of IPython in 2001.  This is
a cleanup I've been wanting to do for over 10 years!  The new setup
makes the magic system have  a very clean api, that is easy to use
both for the implementation of core features and for users to create
their own magics.

2) the new concept of cell magics: these are magics that get not only
the line they're on, but the entire cell body as well.  And while
these are most naturally used in the notebook, as you would expect
we've built them at the core of IPython, so you can use them with all
the clients (terminal, qt console, notebook).  For example, this is a
Cython magic that Brian just prototyped out (we'll have a production
version of it soon included).  Note that this was copied *from a
regular text terminal*, not from the notebook:

In [3]: from IPython.core.magic import register_line_cell_magic

In [4]: @register_line_cell_magic
   ...: def cython(line, cell):
   ...:     """Compile and import a cell as a .pyx file."""
   ...:     import sys
   ...:     from importlib import import_module
   ...:     module = line.strip()
   ...:     fname = module + '.pyx'
   ...:     with open(fname,'w') as f:
   ...:         f.write(cell)
   ...:     if 'pyximport' not in sys.modules:
   ...:         import pyximport
   ...:         pyximport.install(reload_support=True)
   ...:     globals()[module] = import_module(module)
   ...:

In [5]: %%cython bam
   ...: def f(x):
   ...:     return 2.0*x
   ...:

In [6]: bam.f(10)
Out[6]: 20.0

In a similar spirit, Jonathan Taylor recently created one to call R
transparently in the notebook:

https://github.com/jonathan-taylor/Rmagic

This one hasn't been fully updated to the final API, but the core code
is there and now it should be a trivial matter to update it.


I want to thank everyone who pitched in with ideas during the
discussion and review period, and I hope you'll all enjoy this and
come up with great ways to use the system.  For now, you can see how
the system works by playing with %%timeit and %%prun, the only two
builtins that I extended to work also as cell magics.

For more details, see the documentation where we've added also a long
new section with details and examples of how to create your own [4].

Cheers,

f

Python code completion module

From: "Tal Einat" <talei...@gmail.com>
Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2007 20:57:18 +0300

I've been developing IDLE over the past 2 years or so. Even before
that, I helped a friend of mine, Noam Raphael, write IDLE's
auto-completion, which is included in recent versions of IDLE.

Noam wrote the original completion code from scratch, and AFAIK every
Python IDE which features code completion has done the same. Surely
there is -some- functionality which could be useful cross-IDE?
Retrieving possible completions from the namespace, for example. And
we should be learning from each-others' ideas and experiences.

So how about we design a generic Python completion module, that
each IDE could extend, and use for the completion logic?

I am very keen for this. I will help where it is required. PIDA
currently has no code completion (outside what vim/emacs provide),



From: "phil jones" <inters...@gmail.com>
Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2007 11:07:33 -0700

What functions would we ask for a code completion module?

Presumably recognition of the beginnings of
- a) python keywords
- b) classes and functions defined earlier in this file?
- c) in scope variables?

As python is dynamically typed, I guess we can't expect to know the
names of methods of objects?

A good point. I think we all have been thinking about this. Important
issues for the design is the extraction method and the sources.

*the method*
Importing is a lazy, but accurate way of importing, but is security wise
not such a good idea. Parsing throught an AST compiler is better,
however more difficult. Here are two options.

From version 2.5 the standard Python compiler converts internally the
source code to an abstract syntax tree (AST) before producing the
bytecode. So probably that is a good way to go as every python
distribution has this battery included.

As Nicolas suggested earlier on this mailing list, there is another
option: the AST compiler in python or PyPy:

But if it could be done with the standard one it is one dependency less.

*the sources*
In the design we could define first the sources:
1 external imported modules from the pythonpath
2 local modules relative to the current file or context dependent
(Blender, Gimp, ...)
3 inner code

For 1:
It might be a good idea to have a function which scans all the modules
from the pythonpath or one specific module to cache all autocompletion
and calltip information of all classes, methods and doc strings. Why?
Modules in the pythonpath don't change so often. With some criteria
(file name, time stamp, size, ...) you could check if updates are
necessary at startup. Having a readymade 'database' (could be python
dictionary or sqlite database) for autocompletion/call tips would speed
up things (and is also more secure if you are importing rather than
parsing. For example trying to provide gtk autocompletion in a wxPython
by importing is problematic).

For 2:
Here you load the parser on demand. Autocompletion/calltip information
can be added to the database.

For 3:
A different kind of parser needs to be used here as per definition code
you edit contains errors while typing. External modules are retrieved
from 1 and 2, for internal code you can scan all the words and add them
to the autocomplete database. As a refinement you can give special
attention to 'self'. Also for calltips you can inherit when there are
assignments, eg
frame = Frame()
than frame inherits autocomplete & calltip information from Frame.

So autocompletion & calltips deals with two steps: extraction and
'database'. If someone has a good parser already, we could use it.
Otherwise we can define an API for the extraction and maybe lazily
implement it first with importing and concentrate first on the
'database'. When the database is ready we can implement the parsing. You
could also implement the parsing first, but than it takes longer before
you have results. Of course the library is GUI independent, it only
works with strings or lists.

What concerns SPE, it uses importing for autocompletion (1+2) and does
internal code analysis for local code (however without the inheriting).

Tal, how does IDLE's autocompletion works?

How dependent/independent is this from the standard AST compiler or
PyPy? Is it more IDE friendly? Is it based on it or a total independent
implementation?

What concerns me about these is whether they would work in a module
which has a syntax error.

I believe Wing's compiler bit of their code completion is open source.
I remember having seen the code.

It is indeed, but is implemented in C, which means an extra dependency
and not a 100% python solution. Normally modules (especially in the
pythonpath) which you import don't have syntax errors. Maybe logilabs
implementation handles syntax errors well as it is developed for
PyLint. Nicolas?

Well, the dir() builtin does just that, though there can be attributes
which won't be included therein. However, the builtin dir() can be
overridden... and ignoring it can break libraries like RPyC which
define a custom dir() function just for this purpose.

This issue has already been run in to by RPyC (an Python RPC lib). The
main developr went ahead and suggested adding a __dir__ method which
will return a list of attributes, and IIRC he has already implemented
a patch for this, and it will likely enter Python2.6.

Until then, I guess we're going to have to rely on dir for this.



From: "Josiah Carlson" <josiah.carl...@gmail.com>
Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2007 12:42:01 -0700

For reference, PyPE auto-parses source code in the background, generating
(among other things) a function/class/method hierarchy.  Its autocomplete
generally sticks to global functions and keywords, but when doing
self.method lookups, it checks the current source code line, looks up in its
index of classes/methods, and trims the results based on known methods in
the current class in the current source file.

It certainly isn't complete (it should try to check base classes of the
class in the same file, it could certainly pay attention to names assigned
in the current scope, the global scope, imports, types of objects as per
WingIDE's assert isinstance(obj, type), etc.), but it also makes the
computation fairly straightforward, fast, and only in reference to the
current document.

> Tal, how does IDLE's autocompletion works?

Much like Stani said, since Python is interpreted, collection of
possible completions splits into two methods:
1) source code analysis
2) dynamic introspection

Of course, we could do either or a combination of both.

IDLE just uses introspection: since IDLE always has a python shell
running, it just completes according to the shell's state (plus
built-in keywords and modules). This is a very simple method,
obviously lacking. It does allow the user some control of the
completion, though - just import whatever you want to be completable
in the shell. However, introspection is all that is needed in a Python
shell, which is the major reason this is the method used in IDLE.

It is independent from PyPy.

well logilab-astng is basically a big monkey patching of the compiler
package from the stdlib, so you can't get an astng representation from a
module with syntax errors in. However inference and most others
navigation methods (which are basically the value added by astng) are
"syntax error resilient" : if a dependency module (direct or indirect)
contains a syntax error, you don't get any exception, though since some
information is missing you can miss some results you'ld get if the
faulting module were parseable.



From: "Tal Einat" <talei...@gmail.com>
Date: Tue, 31 Jul 2007 10:33:33 +0300

Since astng already does some inference (which we definitely want!)
and is based on the standard Python AST compiler, it sounds like our
#1 candidate. I think we should give the code a serious once-over and
see how well it fits our requirements, and if it can be adapted to
better handle errors. Any volunteers?

Also, has anyone used astng for completion, calltips, or something
similar? Or the standard AST compiler, for that matter?

How does PyPE parse code? Home-rolled, standard AST compiler, something else?

It seems to me we should try to come up with an algorithm for parsing,
before getting to the code. All of the details you mentioned -
noticing assignments, using base-class methods, etc. - could be better
defined and organized this way. Perhaps we could brainstorm on this in
a wiki?



From: "Tal Einat" <talei...@gmail.com>
Date: Tue, 31 Jul 2007 11:38:40 +0300

Sorry for being away for such a long time. I hope we can get this
conversation rolling again, and get started with the actual work.

I'll try to sum up what has been said so far, and how I see things.

== Top Priorities ==
* Can we implement a parser based on the standard Python AST compiler
(or astng)? For example, can syntax errors be handled well?
* Is importing reasonable security-wise? If not, can it be made secure?

== General issues ==
* Do we aim for just completion, or also calltips? Perhaps also other
meta-data, e.g. place defined, source code, ... (see IPython's '??')
* Dependencies - do we want to allow C-extensions, or are we going for
a Python-only solution? (IDLE would only use such a Python-only tool.)
It seems that we want to pre-process most of the data in the
background, so I don't see why we would want to do this in C for
efficiency reasons.

== Completion sources ==
1) Importing "external" modules
2) Importing/Parsing "local" modules
3) Parsing the current file
4) Using objects/modules from the shell (e.g. IDLE has both editor
windows and a Python shell)

== Importing ==
* Stani mentioned that importing is problematic from a security point
of view. What are the security issues? Are they really an issue for an
IDE? If so, perhaps we could overcome this by importing in some kind
of "sandbox"?
* What are the pros and cons of Importing vs. Parsing?
* If importing is always preferable to parsing unless there's a syntax
error, perhaps try to import and parse on failure?

== Parsing ==
* This is going to be the most complex method - I think we should have
a general idea of how this should work before starting an
implementation. I suggest hashing ideas out on a wiki, since there a
lot of details to consider.
* Can a parser based on the standard AST compiler (or astng) work? Is
there a way to deal with errors? (HIGH PRIORITY!)
* There are other existing, open-source implementations out there -
WingIDE, PyPE have been mentioned. Any others? We should collect these
so we can use the code for learning, and perhaps direct use (if
possible license-wise).

== Shell ==
This is relatively straight-forward - just use dir(). This should be
optional, for use by IDEs which have a shell (support multiple
shells?).

Some known issues from IDLE and PyCrust:
* Handle object proxies such as RPC proxies (e.g. RPyC)
* Handle ZODB "ghost" objects
* Watch out for circular references
* Watch out for objects with special __getattr__/__hasattr__
implementations (for example xmlrpc, soap)

== Persistence ==
* Stani mentioned a 'database'. I feel Sqlite should be at most
optional, to reduce dependencies.
* Do we really want to have the data persistent (between IDE
sessiosns)? If so, we need to support simultaneous instances of the
IDE so they don't corrupt the data. Any other issues? (I have a
feeling this would better be left for later stages of development.)

One more note: We should distinguish between completion in an editor
and completion in a shell. The conversation up until now has focused
on editors, which is reasonable since that is the problematic scene. I
think a generic Python completion library should support completion in
both contexts, especially if it uses can use a shell's namespace for
completion in the editor.

I have just implemented a completion mockup using Rope (which is a
refactoring library). It works quite nicely, and definitely worth a
look.

http://rope.sourceforge.net/

It even achieves this kind of completion:

class Banana(object):
    def do_something(self):
         return

def foo():
    return [Banana(), Banana()]

foo()[0].<complete> includes do_something

Which seems pretty impressive to me.



From: "Tal Einat" <talei...@gmail.com>
Date: Tue, 31 Jul 2007 20:12:50 +0300

Wow, Rope does look very impressive! A quick look at the code tells me
that a lot of work has been invested in it.

So we have one existing Python-only solution. We should evaluate it -
see what it can and can't do, and perhaps take a look at the overall
design.

I'm CC-ing Rope's developer, Ali. Hopefully Ali can help us quickly
understand Rope's code analysis capabilities.

Ali, could you elaborate a bit on what kinds of completion Rope can
do, and the methods it uses? We would especially like to know how your
static and dynamic inference work, what they can accomplish, and what
their limitations are.

Well, I haven't really looked at the code. But I can tell you this:

from rope.ide.codeassist import PythonCodeAssist
from rope.base.project import Project
for compl in PythonCodeAssist(Project(package_root)).assist(buffer,
offset).completions:
    print compl

And that is as far as I really got. I expect to get a better look at
it later in the week though...

The compiler for syntactically correct Python, a line-based compiler
for broken Python.  TO generate a method list for self.methods, using
the current line number, I discover the enclosing class, check the
listing of methods for that class (generated by the compiler or
line-based parsers), and return a valid list for the specified prefix.
 It doesn't walk the inheritance tree, it doesn't do imports, etc.

A wiki would be fine, the one for this mailing list would likely be
best (if it is still up and working).  Then again, Rope looks quite
nifty.  I may have to borrow some of that source ;)


Discussion subject changed to "Fwd: Python code completion module" by Tal Einat

From: Ali Gholami Rudi <aligr...@gmail.com>
Date: Aug 1, 2007 5:50 PM

First of all I should note that rope's main goal was being a
refactoring tool and a refactoring tool needs to know a lot about
python modules.  `rope.base` package provides information about python
modules.

Actually what ropeide provides as auto-completion is defined in
`rope.ide.codeassist` module.  This module almost does nothing but use
`rope.base`.  Since `rope.ide` package is not included in the rope
library (which has been separated from ropeide since 0.6m4) it lacks
good documentation and the API might not be easy to use (most of it is
written in the first months of rope's birth).

> ..., could you elaborate a bit on what kinds of completion Rope can
> do, ...

I don't know what to say here.  Well, actually it tries to use the
source code as much as possible and infer things from it.  So I can
say that it can complete any obvious thing that can be inferred by a
human.  Like this is the first parameter of a method and after dots
its attributes can appear or these modules are imported so their names
and contents are available or this is an instance of some known type
and we know its attributes and ... .  Try ropeide (it uses emacs-like
keybinding, C-/ for completion; see ~/.rope if you want to change
that); it completes common cases (and sometimes completes things you
don't expect it to!).

> ..., and the methods it uses?

Rope analyzes python source code and AST.  Rope used to use the
`compiler` module till 0.5 and now it uses `_ast` module.

> We would especially like to know how your
> static and dynamic inference work, what they can accomplish

There are a few examples in docs/overview.txt.  Unit-test modules like
`ropetest.base.objectinfertest` and `advanced_oi_test` might help,
too.  Also have a look at `rope.base.oi.__init__` pydoc for an
overview of how they work; (I'm afraid it is a bit out of date and
carelessly written.)  The idea behind rope's object inference is to
guess what references (names in source-code) hold.  They collect
information about code when they can and use them later.

>..., and what their limitations are.

Many things in rope are approximations that might be exact if some
conditions hold.  For instance rope might assume that every normal
reference in module scope holds only one kind of object.  Apart from
these assumptions both SOI and DOI have their own disadvantages; For
instance SOI fails when dynamic code is evaluated while DOI does not.
Or DOI is slower than SOI.  (Well, after recent enhancements to rope's
SOI I rarely use DOI).

I tried to answer as short as possible.  If there are questions on
specific parts of rope, I'll be happy to answer.

By the way, I tried to reply this mail to the group, but it seems that
your group requires subscription for posting, so I've sent it to you,
instead.

When I say Learn Leo, I don't mean Learn or understand the code, I mean
learn what you can do with it.

My true feeling is that Leo is like an infinite ground, where amazing
things can be built. Some of Leo users are already doing incredible things
with it. But when you are new to Leo, you first have to learn the physics
of this new world (Leo Code), and then develop your own engineering (Useful
outlines structures) for building your "information cities"...

Possibly, experienced leo users dont share this view since they learned Leo
physics and engineering long time ago, but those look like a big wall when
starting with Leo.

So Leo files with samples would be like delivering this infinite ground
with some pre-built "information cities" so people can begin using them
right away. Ideally, those leo files should guide the user on how to build
new structures, and in the end, be able to lead him to generate new
structures.

My (again, personal) feeling is that the current policy right now is: Let
him read the code to understand how it works. So only the users willing to
go through the (1) Learn the physics then (2) develop your own way to
develop "information cities" can actually use leo and use its potential.

Since most of the internet users are the ones who need the cities already
built for them to use software, thats the chunk we are loosing.

On the other hand, coming to why programmers (who have the skills to go
through Leo learning process) dont come and use it, its the same story:

Before coming into Leo, what I was doing was actually search for an IDE
that I liked. I went through several, and in the ones I "liked" the most,
it would take you around two hours learning for having a folder with your
scripts and being able to edit them. With Leo, you first have to study and
understand what are directives, how do they work, how everything interacts
in the tree, etc. It takes more than two hours. I would say that it can be
measured in weeks or months until you really know what you are doing.

And here is where the "information cities" come again. If Leo were provided
with an interactive Leo file, which would guide you into: - Importing your
scripts to Leo - Clearly create folders and move/manage your files there -
Suggest directives for those files. - Etc.

That Leo file would save the new user many many hours and he would
instantly start using leo, so we would help him skip the first wall and
begin to get interested.

So then again, this is why I still see that Leo default workbook should be
dispatched with a Leo cheatsheet open by default, so new users begin to
play with it as soon as they open Leo.

Leo represents a completely new paradigm for editing, programming, and
interacting with data. Well, not completely new, but for many the surface
level seems extremely foreign.

Leo is primarily a tool aimed at python...the paradigm it exposes to the
user is far more like Lisp (homoiconicity via the Node and Tree structure)
and Smalltalk (.leo files save *most* of your programming environment's
state, including data). This is a huge cognitive leap for people only
accustomed to more imperative languages like Python...Leo asks a lot of

Re: the original question "Why isn't Leo more popular" I can ask myself
"Why don't I adopt tools which promise a better way to work?" I do a lot of
grazing, and encounter very many such tools.

A tool which does everything doesn't grab me, I don't need to do
everything. A tool which, in it's few moments of my attention, describes a
better way to do something I need, gets additional moments. If the tool
salesperson mentions a task I encounter and a better way to do it, with a
learning curve which justifies the benefit ... I will settle in for a
while.

Easier, more powerful boilerplates / templates / completion is the kind of
bait I'll bite on, there's potential for decent return on investment.

With "bread crumbs" I refer to...the interactive tutorial creator I have
talked so much about. My aim with this tool is that anything you do,
instantly becomes a tutorial, that can be done again and played forward and
backwards. Basically, your actions become an outline, and other users can
"play them" again. This should mean that making a tutorial will take as
much time as it takes for you to perform the action originally.
.. @+node:ekr.20131001045038.19032: *5* dufriz
As a newbie, I agree. At least, that is the perception, which is
discouraging. I believe it also has to do with the lack of learning
material. The only manual is not very newbie-friendly. It contains a lot of
cross-references to advanced internal commands (@xyz stuff) which put off
newcomers, especially where they are thrown in altogether and may look
scary.

Currently the learning curve does nor _appear_ to be gentle at all. But it
does not necessarily have to be like this. Even if Leo is indeed very
complex and very advanced, I am sure that at least a subset of Leo
functionality can be selected and presented in a nicer way, to attract more
users and help newbies.

Why can't we have some more accessible tutorial, with gentle, self
contained lessons (maybe webcasts, or slides, or simple HTML pages) which
_focus on the basic functionality_? Or perhaps, a two-tiered series of such
lessons, i.e. basic and advanced levels. I think this would be very
helpful.

-----

Another point: Leo is commonly advertised as a programming editor, but it
should be made more clear that it is more than that.

I believe you would attract more users if you also mentioned its usefulness
for general-purpose editing and PIM functionality. Of course, that may be
implicit, but I think you should be putting some more emphasis on this
aspect.

----- 

For me, the trajectory was KeyNote --> MyBase --> NotecasePro/RightNote -->
Leo (!!)

Leo is the best, because it is fully customizable, and gives you seemingly
infinite power. Only, it takes a lot to learn how to use that power.
.. @+node:ekr.20131001045038.19034: *5* dufriz
Consider that Leo is actively developed, and has a responsive community.
When I requested the support for Rich Text, a couple of months ago, it was
promptly implemented in a matter of days.

As for the power, of course Leo can do whatever other PIMs can do, because
it is extensible by Python. The question is whether enough people are
interested in Leo as a PIM, so as to have enough user contributions. I am
still at the beginning, so I have no idea how difficult it may be,
technically, to impement all the PIM features that we need. But if we
succeed in getting enough people interested, I am sure that nothing is
beyond our reach.

As far as PIM features go the next step, I believe, is implementing a good
tagging system.

As a newbie who still has zero knowledge of Leo's technical details, I can
say: I have absolutely no problem in conceptualizing what Leo is and what
it can do, and probably I also get the Leo's aha -- the difficulty is in
getting into the actual technical aspects of the program. Again, in the end
this all boils down to newbie-friendly tutorials and learning materials...
Something like Leo for dummies would be greatly appreciated.

.. @+node:ekr.20131001045038.19035: *5* Terry
I think a lot of the problem is defining what Leo is. In some ways I think
it's Python's Squeak (Squeak http://www.squeak.org/Screenshots/ being a
SmallTalk environment where everything's an object).

If all you want is an off the shelf turn key text editor with perhaps
completion and syntax highlighting as its most advanced features, then
there are several out there that are probably going to appeal more than
Leo.

If you're looking for an off the shelf turn key outliner, without the
intent to use scripts etc., then again there are lots of alternatives, some
of which probably seem more intuitive / simpler / even more feature rich
than Leo. (The feature rich part is probably misleading, but they may seem
that way initially).

If your looking for an *environment* which includes a good editor and
outliner and is completely scriptable / interactive / "live-code" in
Python, then Leo wins hands down. Of course, it's basically alone in this
field, as far as I know, but I'm sure it would do well even if it
wasn't...I guess Emacs is sort of an environment like this, only in Lisp
with a prehistoric GUI system.

Sometimes I've wondered why Leo seems to appeal to people who aren't
comfortable in Python, I think now it's because they still recognize the
value of an *environment*, and there's just not much in this niche. So to
me it's more why don't more people want an environment like this...

My feeling, talking generally and not about Leo in particular, is that
while not everyone needs to be a "programmer", everyone who uses computers
would benefit from being able to interact with them with more of the
flexibility and efficiency that comes with even relatively simple
"scripting", and less of the limitations that come with the "buy our latest
product and you'll be able to do anything you want with a click" view
pushed by other suppliers of computing environments.

I came to Leo because it is the only outliner for Linux that supports
cloning that doesn't require an internet connection.

I am struggling to implement it into my workflow though, simply because I
do not have time to figure out the simplest things. (full time university
student) Right now I simply do not have the 200 minutes available to figure
this out. Yet I can see that if I took the time to do my own setup it would
save me far more time in the future. Leo would be a wonderful platform for
writing anything, but especially for fiction. If there was a tutorial on
setting up Leo to do the following, I know there would be immediate
interest from people who write on Linux as there simply is not an outliner
that meets the needs of the average writer.

I need basic text formatting at the standard hot key level. ie. Ctrl-B for
bold, Ctrl-I for italic etc. while in the edit window. I know this can be
done, I almost had it working once but then got busy and by the time I came
back it had escaped me how I had done it. I don't need buttons, I don't
need WSIWYG, RST markup works fine as it gives me lots of output options. I
just need the ability to put my head down and write, using the shortcuts
that are baked into my fingertips at this point, and not having to relearn
those keys. Support for standard word-processing keys are important for
writers. :-)

I think that by creating tutorials that address the basics for different
groups of users who are not programmers, Leo could be an extremely popular
program. I would be willing to contribute to such an effort for writers if
I can get a workflow setup that makes sense for me. My current editor of
choice is Scrivener for Windows run using Crossover. No cloning. :-(

Leo is far too complex for the average person who simply wants to
accomplish a task. Simplifying things for specific classes of users would
open Leo up to many more people who share those requirements and may be
interested in learning the rest of the power of Leo as their use of it
increases. Give people a foot in the door and they will figure out how to
open it the rest of the way as needed.
.. @+node:ekr.20131001045038.19039: *5* Chris George
i.e. RST markup for "bold".  Is that the goal?

Cheers -Terry

Almost. That plus the ability to be writing along and hit
Ctrl-b s u d d e n l y Ctrl-b and continue on.

I had Leo working to the extent that I could type suddenly Ctrl-Alt-b and
have it retroactively add the markup but it was simply too much of a leap
to change my work habits. Body memory takes years to develop and is not
trivial to attempt to change.

A set of keybindings that mimic the standard word processing key bindings
that then markup the text using RST or Markdown would be a huge step
forward for me in using Leo. Right now I try to find time to fiddle and
play with it, but that has been going on for almost two years now and I
have yet to commit to any serious work in Leo.

===== Terry

Which boils down to Ctrl-b inserting '*' if there's no selection?

I guess it does.

It may seem silly, as I could just type the *, but Shift-8 isn't baked into
muscle memory, Ctrl-b is.

It boils down to being able to replicate those standard word processing
shortcuts in the edit pane and having them not conflict with other key
combos in Leo. Abstracting it to other markup languages would be cool as
well, some people like RST, some people like Markdown. Everyone can use
Ctrl-b.

Ckeditor looks interesting, but it isn't the buttons that matter. I rarely
use the mouse for marking up text.

markup_inline_underline ! body = Ctrl-U

restart Leo

Put the downloaded code in a node, and run it... normally you'd do that
by hitting Ctrl-B, but we just redefined that :-)  So use alt-x
execute-script instead.

Now in the body you should be able to get

**bold** *italic* :ul:`underline`

with the expected keys.  It should be fairly predictable when there's a
selection active.  When there isn't, it just opens or closes the markup
type depending on whether the last action was an open or close, so I
guess nesting would be problem, but rst doesn't understand nesting
inline markup anyway.

The difference between open and close only applies to underline, where
the beginning and end delimiters are different - more a demo than
anything.

To make the code active without the execute-script step it could be
placed in a node which starts with @script, although you need
@bool scripting-at-script-nodes = True
under your @settings node then.

Ideally it would be in a plugin (although it seems heavy to put
essentially one function in a plugin) or core, so it didn't need its

.. @+node:ekr.20131001045038.19043: *5* Ludwig Schwardt: MacOS brew instructions
Miles's comments inspired me to do something about the Homebrew version of
Leo. Instead of following a long-winded and increasingly out-of-date set of
installation instructions you will soon be able to go (if all goes well!):

brew install leo

I've created a rough formula for Leo and uploaded it to my Homebrew tap. To
try it out, do the following:

- Get Homebrew from http://brew.sh/, following their instructions on how to
install it

- Pay special attention to Python - if you have already installed a bunch
of Python stuff, it's best to keep using the existing Python. Otherwise, if
this is your first Python experience it is safe to install the Homebrew
Python (which will make your life easier) via

  brew install python

  (If all your existing Python tools suddenly disappear, go 'brew remove
  python' to restore order :-))

- Get my formulas:

  brew tap ska-sa/tap

- Et voila:

  brew install leo

- If you kept your old Python, follow the instruction in the caveat printed
at the end of:

  brew info leo

  (I.e. add the suggested line to your ~/.bash_profile file if you are not
  using Homebrew Python)

The formula has three versions:

  brew install leo => installs the latest stable release (4.10)
  brew install --devel leo => installs latest alpha (4.11-a2)
  brew install --HEAD leo => installs the bleeding-edge bzr version from Launchpad

It also installs PyEnchant by default (which can be disabled).

I would love some testing of the installation before I submit it to the
main Homebrew repository (if you guys think the formula is a good idea). I
don't use Leo myself and have only done some cursory poking around.

Miles's point about using a Ruby-based installer to install a Python
package also rings true (although this is becoming more popular these days
on the Mac given how awesome Homebrew is for dependencies and Python
extensions, and this is not any stranger than the C-based "apt-get install
leo").

I would expect to install a Python package such as Leo using "pip install
leo" or "easy_install leo". The main problem has always been that Leo has a
non-standard package layout.

I (only now!) see that Ville, Matt and others have created a setup.py and
leo even exists on PyPI so that these installation commands actually do
something. Unfortunately, for me "pip install leo" results in a Leo that
throws an AssertionError upon running. What is the status of this
installation route? (It is not even mentioned on the installation page!)
Also, "leo 4.10-final" on PyPI actually installs "4.11-devel"...

him read the code to understand how it works. So only the users willing to
go through the (1) Learn the physics then (2) develop your own way to
develop "information cities" can actually use leo and use its potential.

​I've spent a lot of time on tutorials, slideshows, etc. However, in light
of your first sentence quoted above, it does seem like I have neglected to
show what people can really do with Leo, at least in the tutorial docs. ​
 
> With Leo, you first have to study and understand what are directives, how
do they work, how everything interacts in the tree, etc. It takes more than
two hours. I would say that it can be measured in weeks or months until you
really know what you are doing.

Maybe, but there is a tantalizing possibility. ​I prototyped Leo in about
two hours, using the MORE outliner as a prototype, and inventing @others in
the process. (I was already deeply involved with sections and section
references.)

So for *me*, the Leo aha was almost instantaneous, once I had an outliner
to prototype my thoughts. Since then, things have become more "voluminous",
yet Leo's DOM is so much simpler and more powerful than it was in the early
days. Do these improvement make Leo *more* difficult to learn? It's hard to
believe so, but then nobody is closer to Leo than I.

> And here is where the "information cities" come again. If Leo were
provided with an interactive Leo file, which would guide you ​...

​The idea of putting a cheat sheet into the default workbook.leo is a great
one. There will be a default_workbook.leo in leo/docs, and the code that
creates ~/workbook.leo will make a copy of the default file. This will
allow continuous improvement on default_workbook.leo.

> For marketing, packaging, features, documentation, tutorials,
extensions,... - do a side by side comparison of Vim and Leo - and the
answer(s) to "why leo isn't more popular" leap out at you.


​The answer is not so clear cut.​ Consider the first item returned by
Google for the search "emacs tutorial":
http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/tcl-course/emacs-tutorial.html

This is hardly a breathtaking introduction to emacs. It would not *by
itself* convert people to emacs. It doesn't even highlight what I consider
the most important Aha about emacs, namely that you don't have to remember
(or type) commands with long names!

No, the reason emacs is popular is that it continues to be taught as *the*
programming editor to generations of computer-programming students. The
students learn *from each other*, using a tedious "tutorial" as a
reference. They learn from looking over each other's shoulders.

Leo would be just as popular, imo, if thousands of college students learned
Leo from each other. This does not excuse lack of further work on Leo
tutorials, but this *is* the essence of the situation.

What an enormously long and interesting thread!

Thanks for the sub-thread on using Leo for plain ol' writing. It rings true
for me. Leo doesn't leverage much of my prior muscle memory, and that leads
me away from it, and once away it takes awhile to return. This is still
true even though I've been using Leo for half a decade now, and have even
contributed a small thing or two to the bzr repository.

I generally use notepad2, notepad++ for quick and dirty scripts (usually
Windows batch files), editing .ini,.conf, xml etc., etc. files. Way fast
startup time and their syntax highlighting know more file types and is more
reliable (complete). They also grok (some) regular expressions.

I use vim (+cream) when I want to do search and replace, which happens a
lot. I just never figured out how to use this properly in Leo;
`[esc]:%s/old-thing/new-thing/g` is just so much faster (modulo the
significant time it takes to construct regular expressions that actually
work!). Saved mini-buffer commands across sessions is also very handy. If
vim+cream was faster to start I'd never use the notepad replacements.

Weirdly, even for python I often use PyScripter instead of Leo. Sometimes
it's because I need to write for a different version of python than I'm
running Leo from. Others it's because the output I get from running a Leo
node as a script differs from the same thing from a cmd
shell/IDLE/PyScripter console. I also find PyScripter's code completion a
bit more intuitive for the way I type (though, I didn't discover that until
I'd already wandered away from Leo for a time).

None of this is meant as a slam against or complaint about Leo! It's just
sharing observations of my personal use/not-use patterns.

Part of my difficulty in becoming comfortable with Leo is that I'm also not
that comfortable with python, or even general programming. I'm not a
software developer; this is changing, but very slowly. Consequently I spend
a lot of in-Leo time in a state of confusion, often unsure whether I'm
trying to learn programming or python or Leo or more about the actual
problem I'm started out trying to solve this morning. :)

Anyway, the point touched on earlier about leveraging the skills and
experience people already have before they encounter Leo is pretty key to
the overall adoption rate, I think.

cheers,

configure_tags killing performance again

EKR:

Rev 2119 contains what appears to be a major improvement in speed:

- leoQTextEditWidget.SetAllText now sets a lockout that prevents a duplicate
  recoloring of text. This doubles the speed of the syntax colorer, and almost
  doubles the speed of unit tests!

- updateSyntaxColorer and colorize set self.flag = False for large body text.
  This doesn't prevent recolor from being called, but it does short-circuit
  recolor.

And yes, configure_tags is called only by the ctor, that is, just once.

Terry Brown

For some time I've wanted a simple way to make an running leo session
load a file from the command line, like emacs-client.\

Now, thanks to Ville, I also want a way to make an running leo session
pop up a stickynote window (which would correspond to an automatically
created node which would probably use current data and time as a
headstring).

Ville

First working version of this (using qt) is now on trunk.

Testing it requires some manual work:

1. bzr pull
2. Put this script (it's a simple example client) to your leo-editor
directory: http://pastebin.com/f2bcbfd36
3. Enable leoremote.py plugin
4. Launch leo, do alt-x leoserv-start. The leo process where you last
ran leoserv-start is always the session that will receive your
commands
5. Try running the script (it's a python script, not leo script) you
created at #2 from another command prompt 

Terry

Very very cool Ville, thanks.

Here http://pastebin.com/mf678e24 is my version of a functioning
stickynote script. 

And here: http://pastebin.com/m236194c

is a quick hack at a script to edit (or create and edit) a file in leo
from the command line. 

Terry -> EKR

> Can you explain in more detail.  I am totally lost about why this
> gives us anything new.  Thanks.

It's probably of little benefit to people who work with mouse, menus, and icons
all the time. But if you do everything from the command line (i.e. your OS's
shell), then it makes moving things into leo much smoother.

Suppose I've run leo and checked my todo items for the day, and now
leo's buried under some other window and I'm working in the shell in
some directory I've just created where I've just unzipped something and
now I want to edit a file that was in the .zip.

I can either:

  - find the leo window
  - insert a node
  - active the open file dialog
  - navigate to the directory containing this file
  - select the file
  - and finally do the editing I want to do

or, with Ville's communication to the running leo:

  - enter on the command line `led foo.txt`
  - and do the editing I want to do

where led is a script which causes the running leo to create an @edit
node containing foo.txt and pop to the front with the node selected.

Previously I was much more likely to use emacs, just because it was
easier to invoke that way from the command line.

So, opening files, creating sticky notes, invoking leo to handle output
from grep or diff or whatever - all these things are better now. 


Matt Wilkie

The corresponding point and click process for this scenario is

a) select > r-click > Edit with Leo
b) or drag'n'drop from folder to Leo icon on task bar (or window if visible)

http://mail.google.com/mail/#label/Cool/121a1f23e75fc348

@language rest

Often, it' useful to decouple node creation from data processing. Case
in point is the read code & the hash based speedup scheme I described
(and referred to again in previous thread!)

(for every instance of 'json' below, you can substitute "hierarchical
python object". I'm thinking of json because of interoperability &
human-readablity of json vs. pickle).

What I mean is:

- Provide a way to create tree structure from json object. This is
easy, just add function

c.createSubTreeFromJson(p, json)

The 'json' arg is just a string with subtree encoded in json. Something like

[ ('h1', 'body1', 'gnx1', [ ('h1.1' , 'body1.1' , 'gnx1.1'), ('h1.2' ,
'body1.2' , 'gnx1.2')], ('h2', ......]

i.e. it's a recursive data structure with list of nodes as tuples (h,
b, gnx, children) where 'children' is the recursive part. So far, so
good. That's the easy part - it's just like xml, apart from the fact
that xml is overkill for this problem, requiring nontrivial parser
code (and thus being of lower usability & speed). Yes, the json is
pretty much the same as repr(python_object).

Now, for the important part.

All code that creates trees (read code as the most relevant example!)
probably shouldn't create the tree directly. Rather, it should use c
and p to learn what it needs to, then compose a result json object and
pass it on to c.createSubTreeFromJson(p, json). This is important &
elegant distinction from current behaviour where the data processing
code also modify the tree. We can basically have tests for most of the
stuff without altering the tree in any way, allowing the tree to stay
"read only" as long as possible.

The hash speedup I've been talking about will execute the auto/thin
parsing code exactly once for the particular file content, store away
the json, and just read that json file on subsequent runs. There is no
need to speculate on feasibility of this scheme, we've already had
that particular discussion. It really is the simplest & fastest
possible solution.

We could also add lazy loading (though this is not as important), but
*also this* will be easier with this scheme. Basically, the lazy
loading would:

- Run in a thread in the background, collecting stuff from external
files to json objects
- Every once in a while, do the "destructive" thing and update the
tree from these json objects, redrawing if necessary.

Also this will be perfectly safe - the background thread never does
gui manipulation. At any given time, it's only reading a file, and
writing the json obj to buffer. No communication with leo gui is
necessary. If position with root obj no longer exist, we just throw
the json away and rescan if needed.

http://mail.google.com/mail/#label/Cool/121b225322eb0a6a

@language rest

I experimented with creating a "direct" recursive data structure for leo trees.

It's pretty simple (who needs Haskell & friends when we have python):

def p_to_obj(p):
   return [p.h, p.b, p.gnx, [p_to_obj(po) for po in p.children_iter()]]

Yes, I removed utf8 encoding to keep it more elegant ;-).

The whole snippet is somewhat like this:

http://pastebin.com/f6a30f859

It creates a python object like this:

http://pastebin.com/f17a3a285

(list of p,h,gnx, children...)

Now, the interesting part. This can be directly encoded as Yaml, to
render the rather readable:

http://pastebin.com/f3d750af3

The part that needs work is the body text, it should probably be
improvable by using "block scalars".

This idea is related to my "jsonification" refactoring suggestion a
while ago. If functions like read code emitted stuff that p_to_obj
returns, the yaml structure could be used to debug / trace the data
(but still in machine-readable form). This could also be used to
communicate outline structure so that it can be both read, and copy
pasted from emails to real tree structure.

No need to take any action regarding this email. Just a food for
thought, perhaps for inspiration...

> Would it be possible to publish somewhere the scripts or other files you use

It's somewhat of a nontrivial effort (that I do manually), but the
debian/ directory is here:

https://code.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/packaging-jaunty

In order to build the package, I have set up the ubuntu "ppa" (you can
register it at launchpad), use "debuild -S -sa" to build the package
when everything is at correct place (it's picky about directory & file
names and such), and use "dput" to upload it to launchpad servers.
After a while (one hour?), the package is built.

I have a .leo file that I use to trace these steps. I can push it to
trunk. But there is no automatic script to do it; it's possible to
just run "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot" when the debian/ directory is
at leo-editor directory, but that's not the "proper" way, as your
environment is almost never clean enough to get a reliable package
that directly reflects the source snapshot at that tag.

No, we want *another window*, like with @button rst-preview, that is
updated in real time. The html output is not editable anyway.

It needs to happen in another process in order to not bog down normal
editing (if we stop doing that, the ui will hang). Generating sphinx
output is somewhat expensive operation.

With @auto-rst, we get this for free (i.e. rendering every time you
save). Barring that, we could do the rendering just for current node,
but that is not faithful to the final output.

I think the best implementation is a new process that monitors a file.
That way, it's not really leo-specific, and it's easy to do. Leo just
needs to tell it what file to monitor.

You can use the ..raw directive

Here is a quote from another thread
http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/16272e...

QQQ
One of the difficulties was how to "convince" Leo to write raw code, I
wanted to write some equations and tables, so it was necessary to use
symbols like \, { }, and so on, i. e., what is required by LaTeX. The
problem was that all these symbols were "interpreted" wrongly and
replaced by an unreadable code. The solution was to use the raw
directive. An example is much better to show this. Assume the
following LaTeX code for an equation and a table in a Leo node:

@
.. raw:: latex html

 \begin{equation}  f(x)=\frac{e^{X\beta}}{1-e^{X\beta}}  \end
{equation}

 \newline
 \begin{tabular}[b]{|r|l||c|r|}
    <content deleted ...>
 \end{tabular}

@c

Attention: RsT code requires an indentation with respect to the raw
directive. I didn't know it. It is here a leading blank space for all
LaTeX code inside the raw directive. And then it worked fine.
QQQ 
.. @+node:ekr.20101127152442.5899: *6* solution 2: use make
I think you get the most control by having leo generate an rst file and
then processing it yourself.

Like this somewhat dated page (skip the first section):
http://leo.zwiki.org/RstEmacs

For a project I'm currently working on, currently :), my set up is like
this:

Edit rst in leo using an @auto-rst node.

Run this script (it is (pointlessly) a Makefile):

.. sourcecode:: make

  all:
        rst2html.py report2.rst report2.html
        itex2MML < report2.html > report2.xhtml
        rst2latex.py --documentoptions=letterpaper --stylesheet-path=myprefs.inc \
          --reference-label="ref*" --use-latex-citations report2.rst report2.tex
        echo | pdflatex -draftmode report2 >/dev/null 2>&1
        echo | pdflatex -draftmode report2 >/dev/null 2>&1
        echo | pdflatex report2 2>&1 | tr \\n \\r
        rst2latex.py --documentoptions=letterpaper --stylesheet-path=myprefs.inc \
          report2.rst report2.tex

The two -draftmode parses take care of references etc. much quick than
non-draft, because they don't chew up time turning pngs and pdfs into
part of the pdf output.  I.e. they don't produce pdf output.

``myprefs.inc`` looks like:

.. sourcecode:: latex

  \usepackage{pslatex}
  \usepackage{mathptmx}
  \usepackage[scaled=.90]{helvet}
  \usepackage{courier}
  \renewcommand\sfdefault{phv}%               use helvetica for sans serif
  \renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault}%    use sans serif by default
  \renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.85}
  \renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.1}
  \renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.75}
  \setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
  \renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.8}

  \setlength{\parskip}{2ex}
  \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

  \addtolength{\oddsidemargin}{-1.5cm}
  \addtolength{\evensidemargin}{-1.5cm}
  \addtolength{\textwidth}{3cm}
  \addtolength{\topmargin}{-2cm}
  \addtolength{\textheight}{4cm}

  \usepackage{fancyhdr}
  \pagestyle{fancy}
  \lhead{Synoptic mapping of Native Plant Communities}
  \rhead{}
  \lfoot{\footnotesize 20091203-draft }

itex2MML (referenced in the ``Makefile``) converts latex math notation to MathML in the .xhtml output.

To insert raw latex in the latex output from rst, use

.. sourcecode:: rst

  .. raw:: latex

     \some{latex here}

Maybe :-) even as I wrote it it was more because I thought email
rendered (to html) from rst was cool, rather than that I think html
email is necessary.  It's funny looking at postings in this list vs. my
main inbox, here very very few msgs have html parts, whereas in the

Did occur to me that it would probably be possibly to set up some
combination of unicode chrs and css which would render leo trees

  `Wetland cluster 8 and variables`_ show the
  relationships between clusters and variables.  The maps
  give a more general view of the clusters, and
  a variable by variable interpretation of each cluster may
  not add much useful information.

  ..  python

    out = file('/home/tbrown/Desktop/Proj/AitkinMap/varvsclust.rst', 'w')
    def pnt(x): out.write(x+'\n')
    for uw in 'Upland', 'Wetland':
      for i in range(1,9):

        pnt("   :width: 95%")

Note: The .. python is just a comment.  "Empty" comments like::

    ..
      print 40+2
      print 'done'

don't work, because empty comments don't consume indented blocks

An @rawfile tree is a tree whose root headline starts with
@rawfile <filename>. Similarly, an @silentfile tree is a
tree whose root headline starts with an @silentfile
<filename> directive.

    Leo creates derived files from @rawfile and @silentfile trees by writing the body text of all nodes of the tree in outline order.  Leo writes the body text _as is_, without recognizing section definitions, without expanding section references, and without treating directives specially in any way.  In particular, Leo copies all directives, including @space or @c directives, to the derived file as text. Exception: Leo recognizes the @ignore directive in @rawfile or @silentfile nodes, so you may use the @ignore directive as usual to prevent Leo from writing @rawfile and @silentfile trees.

There are several difference between @rawfile and @silentfile trees:

@killcolor
@language plain

Note: Previously, one could crash Leo by pasting a large text into a headline.  Leo now truncates that text, and furthermore Leo no longer makes all headline text into one gigantic line.  Therefore, we don't have to test Tk's ability to handle super-long lines.

The test:  Copy the following and paste it into a headline.  Leo should give 2 truncation messages:

- Truncating headline to one line.
- Truncating headline to 250 characters.

About a year ago I found the website at www.literateprogamming.com and was immediately convinced that the basic idea of Literate Programming is an important breakthrough. At the time I was working on a contract trying to decipher a true masterpiece of over-engineering, and if at any time during the construction of this masterpiece the perpetrators had been required to explain themselves in English, my client would have saved millions of dollars.

I never did try CWEB or NOWEB though, because on the literate programming site I read about a tool named “Leo” that combined outlines with Literate Programming techniques. Since I’ve always found outlining tools very useful I downloaded and tried this. I found that using this tool completely changed my programming practice and brought out all of the power inherent in the original Literate Programming idea as I understood it.

The first idea was to use Python's imp module to simulate an import from a file.  This does not work well because imp expects a file, not a StringIO object.

The second idea was to use Python's parser module.  But this returns an instance type, not a module.

A third idea would be to subclass the file type to fool the imp module.

A fourth idea would be to use the ihooks module.  Apparently this module was designed to do something like what I am trying to do!  However, there doesn't seem to be docs for it, so I have imported the code...

load_module( name, file, filename, description) 

Load a module that was previously found by find_module() (or by an otherwise conducted search yielding compatible results). This function does more than importing the module: if the module was already imported, it is equivalent to a reload()! The name argument indicates the full module name (including the package name, if this is a submodule of a package). The file argument is an open file, and filename is the corresponding file name; these can be None and '', respectively, when the module is not being loaded from a file. The description argument is a tuple, as would be returned by get_suffixes(), describing what kind of module must be loaded. 
If the load is successful, the return value is the module object; otherwise, an exception (usually ImportError) is raised. 

Important: the caller is responsible for closing the file argument, if it was not None, even when an exception is raised. This is best done using a try ... finally statement.
@c

@ get_suffixes( ) 

Return a list of triples, each describing a particular type of module. Each triple has the form (suffix, mode, type), where suffix is a string to be appended to the module name to form the filename to search for, mode is the mode string to pass to the built-in open() function to open the file (this can be 'r' for text files or 'rb' for binary files), and type is the file type, which has one of the values PY_SOURCE, PY_COMPILED, or C_EXTENSION, described below.

This is experimental documentation of a program called ListManager, written in
Python and wxPython using Leo to create both the application code and the
associated reST documentation.

ListManager is an application that allows a group of people working on a joint
project to maintain a common list of todos and related items that have owners,
due dates and associated notes. The application uses mysql as its database for
group use and also uses sqlite for locally resident databases for personal
lists. It works in conjunction with Outlook to allow email messages to be sent
to ListManager for inclusion in lists and uses Outlook to mail messages to
users.

os
    uses ``os.getcwd``, ``os.path.split``, ``os.chdir``, ``os.path.join``, ``os.path.getmtime``, ``os.startfile``, ``os.environ``

time
    uses ``time.sleep``, ``time.asctime``

pickle
    used to serialize data that is moved from Outlook to ListManager via sockets.  

socket
    as noted above, a socket is opened between Outlook and ListManager to move messages back and forth

select
    ListManager selects on the socket to see if there is a message that has been queued by Outlook

random
    used by the reminder popup to select messages

ConfigParser
    not surprisingly, using ConfiParser to parse the ListManager.ini file.  

threading
    more for fun than absolute necessity, a thread is opened on starting the program that constructs the list of owners for items.  In theory, if the datasize and number of Lists were large enough it could delay the appearance of the GUI and its initial responsiveness if we didn't construct the ownerlist in a thread.  On the other hand, it really let me play with threads and with creating a custom event that signalled the construction of the owner list to the main thread by posting a custom event.

re
    mainly using ``re.sub('[\\/:*"<>|\?]','-',f)`` to make sure that files are constructed only with legal characters.  Also searching the body text of nodes using re because it allows case insensitive searches through ``re.compile(pat, re.I)``.

pywintypes.CreateGuid
    probably should use pure python GUID that is in ASPN cookbook but it was easiest to just use the Windows GUID function.  Thank you Mark Hammond for win32all.

win32com.client.Dispatch
    used when launching Outlook to send email messages

win32api
    using win32api.GetUserName() in case there is no user name in the ini file or no ini file

MySQLdb
    using Andy Dustman's python extension module to connect to mysql back-end.

sqlite
    using  D. Richard Hipp's python extension to connect to local sqlite databases

import mx.DateTime
    using Marc-André Lemburg's mx.DateTime for dealing with datetime stuff in the databases

CalendarDialog, ModifierDialog, TicklerDialog, MailDialog,LoggerDialog, FinishedDialog, FindDialog, EvalDialog, TreeDialog, StartupDialog
   should just import LMDialogs and then access each dialog class by LM.WhateverDialog

printout.PrintTable
    There was an existing wxPython print module for printing from tables that I have modified to print Lists.

*#from win32com.client import constants*
    probably not wise but since the app only needs two constants from this module, just set the directly.  If MSFT decides to change the api, this is not good.
.. @+node:ekr.20161117164321.430: *10* Constants

olMailItem = 0x0
olFlagMarked = 0x2

OFFLINE_ONLY = False #False-> Online only  ; True-> Online and Offline possible; REMOTE_HOST = None -> Offline only

VERSION = '1.02'

@ @rst-markup

The following two global constants are needed to create emails through Outlook via COM::

    olMailItem = 0x0
    olFlagMarked = 0x2

For some reason, it seemed easier to just include them explicitly rather than worrying about generating all the Outlook constants in order to use early binding.  I supppose if MSFT changes the api, that would be a problem.

Application uses the ``ConfigParser`` module ito parse the ini file.  Unfortunately, ``ConfigParser`` doesn't work exactly like I think it should although it has been improved in 2.3.  My main issue is in the handling of default options.  The default options specified through the constructor show up in every section.  For example, if you use the items(*section*) method
then in addition to returning a list of tuples with whatever option/value pairs exist in the section, the list will include all the default option/value pairs, which does not make a whole lot of sense to me.  At the least, there should be a 'nodefaults' argument whose default was *False* but which could be set to *True*.  The following methods should have this option:

- items
- options
- has_option

In any event, because a nodefaults option does not exist, I create the ConfigParser object twice -- once with default options and once without them.  

The application will work fine if there is no ini file. In an effort to save some typing but not be too obscure, many of the options are read such that they default to the correct value either through explicit defaults in the constructor or statements that evaluate to *None* or *False*.

ListManager is the main class in the application and is a sublass of ``wxFrame``, which is typical for a wxPython application.  From a GUI standpoint, the main child window of the ListManager object is a ``wxNoteBook`` object that holds one ``wxListCtrl`` per notebook page and one ``wxListBox``.  The ``wxListCtrl``\s display item information (e.g., name of the item, owners of the item, etc.) for a particular List and the ``wxListBox``\es displays a list of owners that is used to filter the items displayed by the ``wxListCtrl`` object.

Each ``wxListCtrl`` object has its own set of events that it is hooked to (see CreateNewNotebookPage`<< ListControl Events >>`_.

The ListManager ``__init__`` method is pretty straightforward.  The ``__init__`` arguments are the ones that need to be passed to ``wxFrame __init__`` method. The wxFrame class has the following form:

    ``wxFrame(parent, id, title, pos=wxDefaultPosition, size=wxDefaultSize, style=wxDEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE, name="frame")``

The default style (``wxDEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE``) includes ``wxMINIMIZE_BOX``, ``wxMAXIMIZE_BOX``, ``wxRESIZE_BORDER``, ``wxSYSTEM_MENU``, ``wxCAPTION`` (the latter is the text that appears in the title bar).

``SetIcon`` is a method of ``wxFrame`` that sets the icon in the upper left of the title bar of the frame.  The wxIcon class has the following form:

    ``wxIcon(filename, type, desiredWidth=-1, desiredHeight=-1)``

``CreateStatusBar`` is a method of ``wxFrame``. The wxPython form is:

        ``CreateStatusBar(number=1, style=0, id=-1)``

*number* -->
    number of fields to create. Specify a value greater than 1 to create a multi-field status bar.

``CreateStatusBar`` needs to be called before << Load Recent Files >>.

The various sections of ``__init__`` are explained in their corresponding section::

self.PropertyDicts
    list of dictionaries that describe properties of each ListManager List (note that when referring to a collection of ListManager items a capital *L* List and table are used interchangeably).

self.ItemLists
    list of lists that consist of instance objects of class ``Item``.  Each of the lists contained in self.ItemLists correspond to the items that are being displayed in the ListCtrl.  So ``self.Itemlist[2]`` corresponds to the 2nd tab of the notebook and to the items in self.ListCtrls[2].

The class ``Item`` is just an empty class being used as a convenience to hold item attributes::

    class Item:
        pass

The purpose of the class is just to create an object that can have various attributes as follows:

+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|item.id          |GUID                                                |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|item.name        |string that describes the item                      |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|item.priority    |integer ranging from 1 (high) to 3 (low)            |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|item.owners      |list of the form ["Zatz, Steve", "Hoffman, Steve"]  |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|item.note        |string that provides additional info on item        |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|item.timestamp   |timestamp indicating when an item was last modified |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|item.duedate     |default is None; mx.DateTime date                   |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|item.createdate  |mx.DateTime.now() mx.DateTime timestamp             |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|item.finisheddate|efaut is None; mx.DateTime date                     |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+

self.ListCtrls
    list of of instance objects of class ListCtrls, which are a subclass of wxPython class wxListCtrl.

self.OwnerLBoxes
    list of of instance objects of wxPython class wxListBox, which is a simple one column List Control.

The wxPython constructor for a wxListBox is:

    ``wxListBox(parent, id, pos=wxDefaultPosition, size=wxDefaultSize, choices=[], style=0)``

self.L
    index of the currently active notebook tab.  If there are any tabs in the notebook then one of them is always selected.  If there are no tabs then this is indicated by setting ``self.L = -1``.

self.curIdx
    currently selected row in the active ``ListCtrl``.  There are times like after a row is deleted in which there may be rows visible but no row is selected.

The following lines set the default printer data::

    self.printdata = wxPrintData()
    self.printdata.SetPaperId(wxPAPER_LETTER)
    self.printdata.SetOrientation(wxPORTRAIT)


The wxPython class ``wxPrintData`` holds a variety of information related to printers and printer device contexts. This class is used to create a wxPrinterDC and a wxPostScriptDC. It is also used as a data member of wxPrintDialogData and wxPageSetupDialogData, as part of the mechanism for transferring data between the print dialogs and the application.

self.copyitems
    list that contains item instance objects that have been copied from one list to be moved to another list.

self.modified
    dictionary that contains the information concerning whether any of several elements have been changed.  Chose a dictionary more to test the idea that I could create a simple method that would update the dictionary and here is an example:

    ``EVT_TEXT(self, self.name.GetId(), lambda e: self.modified.update({'name':1}))``

So this lambda function means that if an ``EVT_TEXT`` event occurs then update the dictionary by adding the key to the dictionary (the value is not used and arbitrarily set to 1).  The wxPython form for the macro ``EVT_TEXT`` is:

    ``EVT_TEXT(window, id, func)``

A ``wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_UPDATED`` event is generated when the text in a ``wxTextCtrl`` changes and that is what ``EVT_TEXT`` catches. Note that this event will always be sent when the text control’s content changes - whether this is due to user input or comes programmatically (for example, if ``SetValue()`` is called)

self.Cursors
    dictionary that holds the database cursor objects.  For example, it will look like:  ``{'sqlite':<sqlite cursor object>,'nycpsltszatz':<mysql cursor object>}``

self.tickler_active
    booean determines whether the tickler capabililty is active; can be shut off by unchecking Tickler menu item

self.editor
    list that holds the dictionaries that describe the notes that are edited by the external text editor::

        [
        {
        'table': 'mine',
        'host': 'wxLMDB:sqlite',
        'path': 'C:\\DOCUME~1\\STEVEN~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\Journal Scan schedule.txt',

The method that uses self.editor is `<< Check if Edited File has Changed >>`_.

There is a ``wxPanel`` in the ``AddListControl`` method so each ``wxListCtrl`` has a different panel as parent.

There is a nb_sizer = wxNotebookSizer(nb) class but doesn't seem to make any difference.

self.sqlite_connections
    Here because the sqlite connection has a weakreference that deletes it when you want it around

self.popupvisible
    boolean that is used to ensure that two reminder popups aren't visible at the same time.

self.in_place_editor 
    boolean that indicates whether the inplace item name text editor is active or not.

self.showrecentcompleted
    integer that determines the number of days in the past to retain completed items in the display.

self.LC_font
    default font for all of the ``ListCtrls``:  ``self.LC_font = wxFont(9, wxSWISS, wxNORMAL, wxNORMAL)``

The wxPython ``wxFont`` constructor is:

    ``wxFont(pointSize, family, style, weight, underline=False, faceName="", wencoding=wxFONTENCODING_DEFAULT)``

self.date_titles
    dictionary that holds the various dates that are associated with each item and which can be displayed in the date column.  The dictionary is not modified.  We use one column of each ``ListCtrl`` to display any one of the four dates that that the application tracks. This dictionary associates the item attribute with the text that will be displayed in both the column header for the date and in the dropdown that allows you to change the date:  ``self.date_titles = {'createdate':"Create Date",'duedate':"Due Date",'timestamp':"Last Modified",'finisheddate':"Completion Date"}``

self.attr2col_num
    dictionary that associates the item attribute with the column that attribute is displayed in in the ``ListCtrl``:  ``self.attr2col_num = {'priority':0, 'name':1,'owners':2, 'date':3}``

The following lines construct the Find Dialog and the Dialog that catches errors and shows expressions for debugging::

    self.FindDialog = FindDialog(self, "Find...", "")
    self.EvalDialog = EvalDialog(self, "Evaluate...", "")

Americans live in the most severe weather-prone country on Earth. Each year,
Americans cope with an average of 10,000 thunderstorms, 2,500 floods, 1,000
tornadoes, as well as an average of 6 deadly hurricanes. Potentially deadly
weather impacts every American. Communities can now rely on the National Weather
Service’s StormReady program to help them guard against the ravages of Mother
Nature.

Some 90% of all presidentially declared disasters are weather related, leading
to around 500 deaths per year and nearly $14 billion in damage. StormReady, a
program started in 1999 in Tulsa, OK, helps arm America's communities with the
communication and safety skills needed to save lives and property– before and
during the event. StormReady helps community leaders and emergency managers
strengthen local safety programs.

StormReady communities are better prepared to save lives from the onslaught of
severe weather through better planning, education, and awareness. No community
is storm proof, but StormReady can help communities save lives. Does StormReady

    """ StyleFormat(format='')
    
    Represents the style format for a specific style element.
    A "style" is a dictionary that maps names (of style elements) 
    to StyleFormat instances.
    
    The given format can be a string or another StyleFormat instance.
    Style formats can be combined using their update() method. 
    
    A style format consists of multiple parts, where each "part" consists
    of a key and a value. The keys can be anything, depending
    on what kind of thing is being styled. The value can be obtained using
    the index operator (e.g. styleFomat['fore'])
    
    For a few special keys, properties are defined that return the Qt object
    corresponding to the value. These values are also buffered to enable
    fast access. These keys are:
      * fore: (QColor) the foreground color
      * back: (QColor) the background color
      * bold: (bool) whether the text should be bold
      * italic: (bool) whether the text should be in italic
      * underline: (int) whether an underline should be used (and which one)
      * linestyle: (int) what line style to use (e.g. for indent guides)
      * textCharFOrmat: (QTextCharFormat) for the syntax styles
    
    The format neglects spaces and case. Parts are separated by commas 
    or semicolons. If only a key is given it's value is interpreted
    as 'yes'. If only a color is given, its key is interpreted as 'fore' 
    and back. Colors should be given using the '#' hex formatting.
    
    An example format string: 'fore:#334, bold, underline:dotLine'
    
    By calling str(styleFormatInstance) the string representing of the 
    format can be obtained. By iterating over the instance, a series 
    of key-value pairs is obtained.

http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtextdocument.html#resource

QVariant QTextDocument::resource(int type, const QUrl &name) const

Returns data of the specified type from the resource with the given name.

This function is called by the rich text engine to request data that isn't directly stored by QTextDocument, but still associated with it. For example, images are referenced indirectly by the name attribute of a QTextImageFormat object.

Resources are cached internally in the document. If a resource can not be found in the cache, loadResource is called to try to load the resource. loadResource should then use addResource to add the resource to the cache.

""" yoton.clientserver.py

Yoton comes with a small framework to setup a request-reply pattern
using a client-server model (over a non-persistent connection), 
similar to telnet. This allows one process to easily ask small pieces 
of information from another process.

To create a server, create a class that inherits from 
yoton.RequestServer and implement its handle_request() method.

A client process can simply use the yoton.do_request function. 
Example: ``yoton.do_request('www.google.com:80', 'GET http/1.1\\r\\n')``

The client server model is implemented using one function and one class:
yoton.do_request and yoton.RequestServer.

Details
-------

The server implements a request/reply pattern by listening at a socket. 
Similar to telnet, each request is handled using a connection 
and the socket is closed after the response is send. 

The request server can setup to run in the main thread, or can be started 
using its own thread. In the latter case, one can easily create multiple
servers in a single process, that listen on different ports.

    Setup a simple server that handles requests similar to a telnet server, 
    or asyncore. Starting the server using run() will run the server in
    the calling thread. Starting the server using start() will run the
    server in a separate thread.
    
    To create a server, subclass this class and re-implement the 
    handle_request method. It accepts a request and should return a 
    reply. This server assumes utf-8 encoded messages.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    address : str
        Should be of the shape hostname:port. 
    async : bool
        If True, handles each incoming connection in a separate thread.
        This might be advantageous if a the handle_request() method 
        takes a long time to execute.
    verbose : bool
        If True, print a message each time a connection is accepted.
    
    Notes on hostname
    -----------------
    The hostname can be:
      * The IP address, or the string hostname of this computer. 
      * 'localhost': the connections is only visible from this computer. 
        Also some low level networking layers are bypassed, which results
        in a faster connection. The other context should also connect to
        'localhost'.

        same network.

    to implement a few private methods.
    
    The connection classes are intended as a simple interface for the 
    user, for example to query port number, and be notified of timeouts 
    and closing of the connection. 
    
    All connection instances are intended for one-time use. To make
    a new connection, instantiate a new Connection object. After
    instantiation, either _bind() or _connect() should be called.

class Context(object):
    """ Context(verbose=0, queue_params=None)
    
    A context represents a node in the network. It can connect to 
    multiple other contexts (using a yoton.Connection. 
    These other contexts can be in 
    another process on the same machine, or on another machine
    connected via a network or the internet.
    
    This class represents a context that can be used by channel instances
    to communicate to other channels in the network. (Thus the name.)
    
    The context is the entity that queue routes the packages produced 
    by the channels to the other context in the network, where
    the packages are distributed to the right channels. A context queues
    packages while it is not connected to any other context.
    
    If messages are send on a channel registered at this context while
    the context is not connected, the messages are stored by the
    context and will be send to the first connecting context.
    
    Example 1
    ---------
    # Create context and bind to a port on localhost
    context = yoton.Context()
    context.bind('localhost:11111')
    # Create a channel and send a message
    pub = yoton.PubChannel(context, 'test')
    pub.send('Hello world!')
    
    Example 2
    ---------
    # Create context and connect to the port on localhost
    context = yoton.Context()
    context.connect('localhost:11111')
    # Create a channel and receive a message
    sub = yoton.SubChannel(context, 'test')
    print(sub.recv() # Will print 'Hello world!'
    
    Queue params
    ------------
    The queue_params parameter allows one to specify the package queues
    used in the system. It is recommended to use the same parameters
    for every context in the network. The value of queue_params should
    be a 2-element tuple specifying queue size and discard mode. The
    latter can be 'old' (default) or 'new', meaning that if the queue
    is full, either the oldest or newest messages are discarted.

    Error messages are printed when an attemped connect fails. the
    thread keeps trying until a successful connection is made, or until

    Returns a Connection instance that represents the
    connection to the other context. These connection objects 
    can also be obtained via the Context.connections property.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    address : str
        Should be of the shape hostname:port. The port should be an
        integer number between 1024 and 2**16. If port does not 
        represent a number, a valid port number is created using a 
        hash function.
    max_tries : int
        The number of ports to try; starting from the given port, 
        subsequent ports are tried until a free port is available. 
        The final port can be obtained using the 'port' property of
        the returned Connection instance.
    name : string
        The name for the created Connection instance. It can
        be used as a key in the connections property.
    
    Notes on hostname
    -----------------
    The hostname can be:
      * The IP address, or the string hostname of this computer. 
      * 'localhost': the connections is only visible from this computer. 
        Also some low level networking layers are bypassed, which results
        in a faster connection. The other context should also connect to
        'localhost'.
      * 'publichost': the connection is visible by other computers on the 
        same network. Optionally an integer index can be appended if
        the machine has multiple IP addresses (see socket.gethostbyname_ex).

    not be made.
    
    Returns a Connection instance that represents the
    connection to the other context. These connection objects 
    can also be obtained via the Context.connections property.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    address : str
        Should be of the shape hostname:port. The port should be an
        integer number between 1024 and 2**16. If port does not 
        represent a number, a valid port number is created using a 
        hash function.
    max_tries : int
        The number of ports to try; starting from the given port, 
        subsequent ports are tried until a free port is available. 
        The final port can be obtained using the 'port' property of
        the returned Connection instance.
    name : string
        The name for the created Connection instance. It can
        be used as a key in the connections property.
    
    Notes on hostname
    -----------------
    The hostname can be:
      * The IP address, or the string hostname of this computer. 
      * 'localhost': the connection is only visible from this computer. 
        Also some low level networking layers are bypassed, which results
        in a faster connection. The other context should also host as
        'localhost'.
      * 'publichost': the connection is visible by other computers on the 
        same network. Optionally an integer index can be appended if
        the machine has multiple IP addresses (see socket.gethostbyname_ex).

    Represents a package of bytes to be send from one Context instance 
    to another. A package consists of a header and the encoded message.
    
    To make this class as fast as reasonably possible, its interface
    is rather minimalistic and few convenience stuff is implemented.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : bytes
        The message itself.
    slot : long
        The slot at which the package is directed. The integer is a hash of
        a string slot name.
    source_id : long
        The id of the context that sent this package.
    source_seq : long
        The sequence number of this package, counted at the sending context.
        Together with source_id, this fully identifies a package.
    dest_id : long (default 0)
        The id of the package that this package replies to. 
    dest_seq : long (default 0)
        The sequence number of the package that this package replies to.
    recv_seq : long (default 0)
        The sequence number of this package counted at the receiving context.
        This is used to synchronize channels.
    
    When send, the header is composed of four control bytes, the slot,
    the source_id, source_seq, dest_id and dest_seq.
    
    Notes
    -----
    A package should always have content. Packages without content are only 
    used for low-level communication between two ContextConnection instances. 
    The source_seq is then used as the signal. All other package attributes
    are ignored.

""" Module yoton.events

Yoton comes with a simple event system to enable event-driven applications.

All channels are capable of running without the event system, but some
channels have limitations. See the documentation of the channels for 
more information. Note that signals only work if events are processed.

"""

# This code is loosely based on the event system of Visvis and on the
# signals system of Qt.

# Note: Python has a buildin module (sched) that does some of the things
# here. Hoever, only since Python3.3 is this buildin functionality 
# thread safe. And we need thread safety!

    context : yoton.Context instance
        The context that this channel uses to send messages in a network.
    slot_base : string
        The base slot name. The channel appends an extension to indicate

    Details
    -------
    Messages send via a channel are delivered asynchronically to the 
    corresponding channels.
    
    All channels are associated with a context and can be used to send
    messages to other channels in the network. Each channel is also
    associated with a slot, which is a string that represents a kind 
    of address. A message send by a channel at slot X can only be received 
    by a channel with slot X. 
    
    Note that the channel appends an extension
    to the user-supplied slot name, that represents the message type 
    and messaging pattern of the channel. In this way, it is prevented
    that for example a PubChannel can communicate with a RepChannel.

    The request part of the request/reply messaging pattern.
    A ReqChannel instance sends request and receive the corresponding 
    replies. The requests are replied by a yoton.RepChannel instance.
    
    This class adopts req/rep in a remote procedure call (RPC) scheme.
    The handling of the result is done using a yoton.Future object, which 
    follows the approach specified in PEP 3148. Note that for the use
    of callbacks, the yoton event loop must run.
    
    Basic load balancing is performed by first asking all potential
    repliers whether they can handle a request. The actual request
    is then send to the first replier to respond.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    context : yoton.Context instance
        The context that this channel uses to send messages in a network.
    slot_base : string
        The base slot name. The channel appends an extension to indicate
        message type and messaging pattern to create the final slot name.
        The final slot is used to connect channels at different contexts
        in a network
    
    Usage
    -----
    One performs a call on a virtual method of this object. The actual
    method is executed by the yoton.RepChannel instance. The method can be 
    called with normal and keyword arguments, which can be (a 
    combination of): None, bool, int, float, string, list, tuple, dict.
    
    Example
    -------
    # Fast, but process is idling when waiting for the response.
    reply = req.add(3,4).result(2.0) # Wait two seconds
    
    # Asynchronous processing, but no waiting.
    def reply_handler(future):
        ... # Handle reply
    future = req.add(3,4)

    """
    
    # Notes on load balancing:
    #
    # Firstly, each request has an id. Which is an integer number
    # which is increased at each new request. The id is send via
    # the dest_seq. For pre-request messages an offset is added
    # to recognize these meta-messages.
    #
    # We use an approach I call pre-request. The req channel sends
    # a pre-request to all repliers (on the same slot) asking whether
    # they want to handle a request. The content is 'req?' and the
    # dest_seq is the request-id + offset.
    #
    # The repliers collects and queues all pre-requests. It will then
    # send a reply to acknowledge the first received pre-request. The
    # content is 'req!' and dest_seq is again request-id + offset.
    #
    # The replier is now in a state of waiting for the actual request.
    # It will not acknowledge pre-requests, but keeps queing them.
    #
    # Upon receiving the acknowledge, the requester sends (directed 
    # at only the first replier to acknowledge) the real request.
    # The content is the real request and dest_seq is the request-id.
    # Right after this, a pre-request cancel message is sent to all
    # repliers. The content is 'req-' and dest_seq is request-id + offset.
    #
    # When a replier receives a pre-request cancel message, it will 
    # remove the pre-request from the list. If this cancels the 
    # request it was currently waiting for, the replier will go back
    # to its default state, and acknowledge the first next pre-request
    # in the queue.
    #
    # When the replier answers a request, it will go back to its default
    # state, and acknowledge the first next pre-request in the queue. 
    # The replier tries to answer as quickly to pre-requests as possible.
    #
    # On the request channel, a dictionary of request items is maintained.
    # Each item has an attribute specifying whether a replier has
    # acknowledged it (and which one).
