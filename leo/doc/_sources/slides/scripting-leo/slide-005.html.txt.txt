p.h and p.b
===========

For any position p, p.h is the headline text of p.v, and p.b is the body text of p.v.

p.h and p.b are Python properties, which means you can set the headline and body text by assigning to them::

    p.h = p.h + ' more'

After changing a headline, Leo scripts should redraw the outline::

    c.redraw()
