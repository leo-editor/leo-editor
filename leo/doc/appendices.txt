.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.351: *3* Bugs
The following bugs can not be fixed:

1.  The Untangle command has no way of updating a section whose name has been changed in the external file.

    Because of the @unit directive, there is not even a way to issue a meaningful warning.

2.  The Tangle command treats @c like @code in CWEB mode.

    I recommend changing @c to @< c @>= throughout your CWEB sources
    and adding a reference to @< c @> in all roots of CWEB files.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.307: *3* Errors while tangling
The following error messages may be generated by the Tangle commands.

Can not re-open temp file
    A file error occurred while trying to reopen the temporary file used during tangling.

Can not rename temporary file name
    A file error occurred while trying to change the name of the temporary file used during tangling.

@code expects the header: [text of header] to contain a section name
    An @code directive appeared in body text whose header does not contain a section name.

@directive not valid here
    An @directive was seen somewhere other than the start of a line.

Halting Tangle: too many errors
    Tangle detected more than 20 errors.

Invalid recursive reference of << section name >>
    A section was defined in terms of itself, either directly or indirectly.
    The trace shows the chain of section definitions that resulted in the illegal definition.

This message is followed by a walkback of the section names that recursively reference the section.
    The walkback looks like this::

        called from << section name >>
        called from << section name >>
        ...

Multiple parts not allowed for << section name >>
    Sections can be defined in several parts in two ways:

    1.  Using << section name >>= in several places with the same section name.

    2.  Using several @code directives within the same body text.

    As a precaution against mistakenly defining a section in more than one place,
    it is invalid to use @code in different nodes to define multiple parts for the same section.
    In particular, this error may arise when using cloned nodes.
    This error may always be eliminated by using << section name >>= instead of @code.

No file written because of errors
    Tangle did not write a file because errors were found.

Run on comment
    A C-language comment was not properly terminated.

Run on file name in @root directive
    The file name in an @root directive was not terminated with the proper delimiter.

Run on section name
    A section name was not properly terminated before the end of the line in which it started.

Run on string
    A C-language string or character constant was not properly terminated.

Section definition not valid here.
    Something that looks like a section definition was seen in the middle of a line.

Sections nested too deeply
    A section was defined using more than 100 levels of section definitions (!)
    You could easily create an outline containing every computer program ever written in less than 50 levels.

The outline contains no roots
    The selected outline contained no @root directive.

Undefined section:  <<< section name >>>
    A reference to an undefined section was encountered.

Unexpected @directive while putting code
    Tangle outputs 2-character WEB control code in a comment.
    This message is given if we find such comments in a code definition.

Warning: possible duplicate definition of: <<< section name >>>
    (The text of the duplicate definition follows.)
    The section may have been defined in more than one place.

Warning: <<< section name >>> has been defined but not used
    The indicated section appears in the outline but is never referenced.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.327: *3* Errors while untangling
The following error messages may be generated by the Untangle commands.

Incompatible definitions of <<< section name >>>
    Two expansions of << section name >> were different in the external file.
    This typically arises when the programmer changes one of the expansions but not the other.

Missing root part
    No end sentinel line was found for a part of the expansion of the code in the @root node.
    This is likely the result of adding, deleting or altering a sentinel line.

Missing root section
    No end sentinel line was found for the expansion of the code in the @root node.
    This is likely the result of adding, deleting or altering a sentinel line.

Missing sentinel line for <<< section name >>>
    The end sentinel name for << section name >> was expected but not found.
    This is likely the result of adding, deleting or altering a sentinel line.

Unterminated section: <<< section name >>>
    The end of the file was reached before encountering the end sentinel line for << section name >>.
    This is likely the result of adding, deleting or altering a sentinel line.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.333: *3* Errors while reading @file nodes
The following are all serious errors, meaning that the data in a external file has been corrupted::

    Bad @+leosentinel in <filename>
    Bad @delims
    Bad attribute field in @+node
    Bad child index in @+node
    File may have damaged sentinels!
    Ignoring <sentinel kind> sentinel.  Expecting <sentinel kind>
    Ignoring unexpected @+leo sentinel
    Missing <sentinel kind> sentinel
    Missing @file in root @node sentinel
    Outline corrupted: different nodes have same clone index!
    Replacing body text of orphan <node name>
    Unexpected end of file. Expecting <sentinel kind> sentinel
    Unknown sentinel: <sentinel line>

You should restore the information from a backup .leo file using the Read Outline Only commands,
followed by a Write @file Nodes command
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.336: *3* Errors while writing @file nodes
Errors while writing @file nodes are harmless.
No information is lost because all information is written to the .leo file rather than the external file.

bad @delims directive
    A node contains an ill-formed @delims directive.

@ignore node <headline>
    The body text of *headline* contains an @ignore directive.

orphan node: <headline>
    The node is referenced by no ancestor node, and no @others directive applies to it.

@others already expanded in: <headline>
    The node contains more than one @others directive.

Rename failed: no file created! (file may be read-only)
    Leo's Save command writes external files to a temporary file,
    and replaces the external file by the temporary files only if the two files are different.
    A problem with the file system prevented the temporary file from being renamed.

Path does not exist: <filename>

undefined section: <section name> referenced from: <headline>
    The node given by *headline* contains a reference to *section name*
    but no section definition node for *section name* exists in the descendants of *headline*.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.357: *3* Format of .leo files
This technical information may be of use to those wanting to process Leo files with special-purpose filters.
Leo's uses XML for its file format.
The following sections describe this format in detail.
**Important**:
The actual read/write code in leoFileCommands.py is the authoritative guide.
When in doubt about what Leo actually writes, look at an actual .leo file in another editor.

Here are the elements that may appear in Leo files.
These elements must appear in this order.

<?xml>
    Leo files start with the following line::

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?xml-stylesheet>
    An xml-stylesheet line is option.  For example::

        <?xml-stylesheet ekr_stylesheet?>

<leo_file>
    The <leo_file> element opens an element that contains the entire file.
    </leo_file> ends the file.

<leo_header> 
    The <leo_header> element specifies version information and other information
    that affects how Leo parses the file.  For example::

        <leo_header file_format="2" tnodes="0" max_tnode_index="5725" clone_windows="0"/>

    The file_format attribute gives the 'major' format number.
    It is '2' for all 4.x versions of Leo.
    The tnodes and clone_windows attributes are no longer used.
    The max_tnode_index	attribute is the largest tnode index.

<globals>
    The globals element specifies information relating to the entire file.
    For example::

        <globals body_outline_ratio="0.50">
            <global_window_position top="27" left="27" height="472" width="571"/>
            <global_log_window_position top="183" left="446" height="397" width="534"/>
        </globals>

    -   The body_outline_ratio attribute specifies the ratio of the height of the body pane to
        the total height of the Leo window.
        It initializes the position of the splitter separating the outline pane from the body pane.

    -   The global_window_position and global_log_window_position elements
        specify the position of the Leo window and Log window in global coordinates:

<preferences>
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the <preferences> element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty <preferences> element.

<find_panel_settings>
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the <find_panel_settings> element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty <find_panel_settings> element.

<clone_windows>
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the <clone_windows> element when reading.
    Leo no longer writes <clone_windows> elements.

<vnodes>
    A single <vnodes> element contains nested <v> elements.
    <v> elements correspond to vnodes.
    The nesting of <v> elements indicates outline structure in the obvious way.

<v>
    The <v> element represents a single vnode and has the following form::

        <v...><vh>sss</vh> (zero or more nested v elements) </v>

    The <vh> element specifies the headline text.
    sss is the headline text encoded with the usual XML escapes.
    As shown above, a <v> element may contain nested <v> elements.
    This nesting indicates outline structure in the obvious way.
    Zero or more of the following attributes may appear in <v> elements::

        t=name.timestamp.n
        a="xxx"

    The t="Tnnn" attribute specifies the tnode associated with this vnode.
    The a="xxx" attribute specifies vnode attributes.
    The xxx denotes one or more upper-case letters whose meanings are as follows::

        C	The vnode is a clone. (Not used in 4.x)
        E	The vnode is expanded so its children are visible.
        M	The vnode is marked.
        T	The vnode is the top visible node.
        V	The vnode is the current vnode.

    For example, a="EM"  specifies that the vnode is expanded and is marked.

    **New in 4.0**:

    -   <v> elements corresponding to @file nodes now contain tnodeList attributes.
        The tnodeList attribute allows Leo to recreate the order in which nodes should appear in the outline.
        The tnodeList attribute is a list of gnx's: global node indices.
        See Format of external files (4.x) for the format of gnx's.

    -   Plugins and scripts may add attributes to <v> and <t> elements.
        See `Chapter 13: Writing plugins`_ for details.

<tnodes>
    A single <tnodes> element contains a non-nested list of <t> elements.

<t>
    The <t> element represents a single tnode and has this form::

        <t tx="Tnnn"><tb>sss</tb></t>

    The tx attribute is required.
    The t attribute of <v> elements refer to this tx attribute.
    The <tb> element specifies the body text.
    sss is the headline text encoded with the usual XML escapes.

    **New in 4.0**:
    Plugins and scripts may add attributes to <v> and <t> elements.
    See `Chapter 13: Writing plugins`_ for details.
.. @+node:ekr.20060921064744.1: *3* Format of external files
This section describe the format of external files.
Leo's `sentinel lines`_ are comments, and this section describes those comments.

The format of external files produced by Leo 4.0 and later meets the following goals:

- The minimum of sentinels needed to properly recreate the outline.

- A robust way of telling whether newlines belong to sentinels or not.
  Prior to Leo 4.0, deleting blank lines before and after sentinel lines
  could corrupt the outline structure of the external file.

- A minimum of intrusion and ugliness.

**New in Leo 4.2**:
Files derived from @thin use gnx's in @+node and @-node sentinels.
Such gnx's permanently and uniquely identify nodes.
Gnx's have the form::

    id.yyyymmddhhmmss
    id.yyyymmddhhmmss.n

The second form is used if two gnx's would otherwise be identical.

- id is a string unique to a developer, e.g., a cvs id.

- yyyymmddhhmmss is the node's creation date.

- n is an integer.

Here are the sentinels used by Leo, in alphabetical order.
Unless otherwise noted, the documentation applies to all versions of Leo.
In the following discussion, gnx denotes a gnx as described above.

\@<<
    A sentinel of the form @<<section_name>> represents a section reference.

    If the reference does not end the line,
    the sentinel line ending the expansion is followed by the remainder of the reference line.
    This allows the Read code to recreate the reference line exactly.

\@@
    The @@ sentinel represents any line starting with @ in body text
    except @*whitespace*, @doc and @others.
    Examples::

      @@nocolor
      @@pagewidth 80
      @@tabwidth 4
      @@code

\@afterref **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks non-whitespace text appearing after a section references.

\@+all **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the start of text generated by the @all directive.

\@-all **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the end of text generated by the @all directive.

\@at and \@doc
    The @+doc and @-doc sentinels delimit doc parts within a node that starts with @doc.
    These sentinels are nested within @body directives.
    Similarly, @+at and @-at sentinels delimit doc parts within a node that start with @ *whitespace*.
    We use the following **trailing whitespace convention**
    to determine where putDocPart has inserted line breaks::

        A line in a doc part is followed by an inserted newline
        if and only if the newline if preceded by whitespace.

    To make this convention work,
    Leo's write code deletes the trailing whitespace of all lines that are followed by a "real" newline.

    **Leo 4.0 and later**:
    The @+doc and @+at sentinels now contain the whitespace that follows
    the corresponding @doc or @ directives.

\@+body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the start of body text.

\@-body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the end of body text.

\@delims
    The @delims sentinel inserts @@delims sentinels into the external file.
    The new delimiter strings continue in effect until the next @@delims sentinel
    *in the external file* or until the end of the external file.
    Adding, deleting or changing @@delim *sentinels* will destroy Leo's ability to read the external file.
    Mistakes in using the @delims *directives* have no effect on Leo,
    though such mistakes will thoroughly mess up a external file as far as compilers,
    HTML renderers, etc. are concerned. 

\@+leo
    Marks the start of any external file.
    This sentinel has the form::

        <opening_delim>@leo<closing_delim>

    The read code uses single-line comments if <closing_delim> is empty.
    The write code generates single-line comments if possible.

    **New in Leo 4.0**: The @+leo sentinel contains other information following
    @leo.  For example::

        <opening_delim>@leo-ver=4-thin<closing_delim>

\@-leo
    Marks the end of the Leo file.
    Nothing but whitespace should follow this directive.

\@+middle **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the start of intermediate nodes between the node that
    references a section and the node that defines the section.
    Typically no such sentinels are needed: most sections are defined in a direct child of the referencing node.

\@-middle **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the end of intermediate nodes between the node that
    references a section and the node that defines the section.

\@+node and \@-node
    Mark the start and end of a node.

    **Leo 4.2 and later**::
    @+node and @-node sentinels use gnx's as described above::

        @+node:gnx:<headline>
        @-node:gnx:<headline>

    Leo generates these sentinels only for nodes containing body text.
    Leo no longer generates other @+node sentinels to indicate outline structure.
    As a result, there is no longer any need for @+body sentinels.

    **Before Leo 4.2**::
    @+node and @-node sentinels used child indices, and status fields as described below::

      @+node:<child_index>:<status_fields>:<headline>
      @-node::<child_index>:<status_fields>:<headline>

    <child_index> is a number from 1 to n indicating the index of the node in the list of its parent's children.
    <status_field> is the cloneIndex field of the form: "C=nnn", where nnn is an immutable clone index.
    <headline> contains *headline* text, not reference text.

\@nl **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Adds a newline to the body text.

\@nonl **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Suppresses a newline from the body text.

\@others
    The @+others sentinel indicates the start of the expansion of an @+others directive,
    which continues until the matching @-others sentinel.
    @others sentinels are nested within @body sentinels;
    the expansion of the @others directive always occurs within the body text of some node.

\@verbatim
    @verbatim indicates that the next line of the external file is not a sentinel.
    This escape convention allows body text to contain lines that would otherwise be considered sentinel lines.

\@@verbatimAfterRef
    @verbatimAfterRef is generated when a comment following a section reference would otherwise be treated as a sentinel.
    In Python code, an example would be::

      << ref >> #+others

    This sentinel is required only when blank lines are suppressed between sentinel lines.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.354: *3* Unicode reference
Leo uses unicode internally for all strings.

1.  Leo converts headline and body text to unicode when reading .leo files and external files.
    Both .leo files and external files may specify their encoding.  The default is utf-8.
    If the encoding used in a external file is not "utf-8" it is represented in the @+leo sentinel line.
    For example::

        #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

    The utf-8 encoding is a "lossless" encoding (it can represent all unicode code points),
    so converting to and from utf-8 plain strings will never cause a problem.
    When reading or writing a character not in a "lossy" encoding,
    Leo converts such characters to '?' and issues a warning. 

2.  When writing .leo files and external files Leo uses the same encoding used to read the file,
    again with utf-8 used as a default.

3.  leoSettings.leo contains the following Unicode settings, with the defaults as shown::

        default_derived_file_encoding = UTF-8 
        new_leo_file_encoding = UTF-8 

    These control the default encodings used when writing external files and .leo files.
    Changing the new_leo_file_encoding setting is not recommended.
    See the comments in leoSettings.leo.
    You may set default_derived_file_encoding to anything that makes sense for you.

4.  The @encoding directive specifies the encoding used in a external file.
    You can't mix encodings in a single external file.
