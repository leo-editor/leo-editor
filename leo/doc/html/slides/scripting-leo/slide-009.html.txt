g.openWithFileName
==================

g.openWithFileName opens a .leo file::

    ok, frame = g.openWithFileName(fileName,c)
    new_c = frame.c

The returned frame value represents the frame of the visual outline.

frame.c is the frame’s commander, so new_c is the commander of the newly-created outline.
