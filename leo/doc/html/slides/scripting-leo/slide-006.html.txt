Iterators
=========

Leo defines Python iterators that return positions. These iterators are the easiest way of gaining access to the nodes of Leo outlines. Here are just a few examples:

- **c.all_positions()** returns all the positions of the outline in order.

  *Note*: Cloned nodes will appear several times in this list.

- **c.all_unique_nodes()** returns all the vnodes of the outline.
- **p.self_and_subtree()** returns p and all its descendants.
- **p.children()** returns all of pâ€™s direct children.
