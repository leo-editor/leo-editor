Views focus attention
=====================

Views focus attention on tasks. I track issues as follows:

I create a **task node** whose children contain all the relevant data.

Cloned children gather data from all parts of the outline.

Non-cloned children contain supplemental data:
- A summary of the task.
- Test data.
- Any other notes.
