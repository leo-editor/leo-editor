=============================
Shift-Ctrl-C: copy an outline
=============================


We can copy and paste nodes and all their descendants.

Using the arrow keys as necessary, I select the
"to do" node.

The Shift-Ctrl-C key copies the selected outline.

I want to do the paste *after* the to-do list, so I collapse
the original node before doing the paste:
