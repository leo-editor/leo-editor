Summary: arrow keys
===================


The arrow keys do different things depending on
which pane has focus. Using arrow keys is **much**
easier than using the mouse.

**Focus in outline pane**

    The **plain** arrow keys **select** nodes,
    expanding or contracting nodes as needed.

    The **shift** arrow keys **move** nodes. The
    Shift-Left-Arrow and Shift-Up-Arrow contract
    nodes as needed. **Note**: the
    Shift-Down-Arrow and Shift-Right-Arrow keys
    never expand nodes.

**Focus in body pane**

    As usual, the **plain** arrow keys move the
    cursor and the **shift** arrow keys move the
    cursor and extend the solution.

    The **alt** arrow keys move the focus to the
    outline pane and then select nodes. The
    **alt-shift** arrow keys move the focus to the
    outline pane and then move nodes.

..  - The Up-Arrow and Down-Arrow keys select
..  the previous or next visible nodes.

..  - The Right-Arrow key contracts a node if the node
..  is expanded. Otherwise the Right-Arrow key
..  selects the node's parent.

..  - The Left-Arrow key does nothing if the selected
..  node has no children.  If the node does have
..  children, the Left-Arrow key expands the node
..  (if the children or invisible) or selects the
..  first child (if the children are visible).

..  This is exactly how Windows explorer works, and
..  it quickly becomes second nature.
