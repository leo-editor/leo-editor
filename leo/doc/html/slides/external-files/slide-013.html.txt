More about expansions
=====================

Node may contain arbitrarily many section references.

No node may contain more than one @others directive.

The expansion of a section reference is the expansion of the body of the
section definition node. That expansion may include expansions of other
references appearing in that node.

The expansion of an @others directive is the expansion of all descendant
nodes that are *not* section definition nodes.

No node is ever included in the expansion of more than one @other
directive. If several ancestors contain @others directives, the @others
directive in the nearest ancestor applies.
