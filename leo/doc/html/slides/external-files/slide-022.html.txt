Using @edit nodes
=================

When Leo reads and @edit node, Leo reads the entire contents of the external file into the body text of the @edit node. Any changes to the external file will appear in the @edit node the next time Leo loads the external file. Rather than creating new files with @edit, it is more common to use @edit to connect Leo with files that already exist on your file system.
