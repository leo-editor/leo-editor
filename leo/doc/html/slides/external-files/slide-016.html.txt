SpamClass
=========

The first child node creates the expansion of SpamClass. The lines::

    class SpamClass:
        '''A class representing spam.'''

have no extra indentation, because the @others in the top-level node has no leading whitespace.

However, the two methods of the class will have 4 spaces of indentation because the @others directive in this node is indented by 4 spaces.
