Using @auto nodes
=================

When reading an @auto node, Leo uses an **importer** to create an outline.

Leo has importers for many languages including C, html, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, and xml.

The file's extension determines which importer to use.

If no importer exists for a language, @auto copies the entire file into the @auto node.
