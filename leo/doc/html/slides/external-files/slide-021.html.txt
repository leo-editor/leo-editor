@auto example
=============

Here is an example of an actual Python file imported into Leo.

The importer has created the entire outline, including the body text of the root @auto node.

The importer created an @others directive (1) to place the expansion of the descendant nodes properly, before the final top-level lines of the file (2).

.. image number is misleading.
