================
Hide child nodes
================


After creating the to-do list, I want to hide it
by **collapsing** the "to do" node.

I could do that by clicking the black triangle
to the left of the "to do" node.

However, using the mouse is not recommended--there are much easier ways.

.. arrow points to black triangle.
