This concludes the introduction to Leo's outline operations:

- Ctrl-I: Create a new node.
- <Return> ends headline editing and puts focus in the body.
- Arrow keys and other shortcuts move, expand and contract nodes.
- Shift-Ctrl-C: copies the selected node and all its descendants.
- Shift-Ctrl-V: pastes the copied outline.
