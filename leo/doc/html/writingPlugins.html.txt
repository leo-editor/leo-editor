Overview
++++++++

A **plugin** is a Python file that appears in Leo's plugin directory. Plugins
modify how Leo works. With plugins you can give Leo new commands, modify how
existing commands work, or change any other aspect of Leo's look and feel.
``leoPlugins.leo`` contains all of Leo's official plugins. Studying this file is
a good way to learn how to write plugins.

You **enable** plugins using @enabled-plugins nodes in leoSettings.leo or
myLeoSettings.leo. For more details, see the @enabled-plugins node in
leoSettings.leo. Leo imports all enabled plugins at startup time. Plugins become
**active** if importing the plugin was successful.

Writing plugins is quite similar to writing any other Leo script.  See
`Chapter 7\: Scripting Leo with Python`_. In particular:
    
1. Plugins can use any of Leo's source code simply by importing any module
   defined in leoPy.leo.

2. Plugins can register event handlers just like any other Leo script. For full
   details, see the section called `event handlers`_ in Leo's scripting chapter.
   
The rest of this chapters discusses topics related specifically to plugins.


Support for unit testing
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The plugins test suite creates a new convention: if a plugin has a function at
the outer (module) level called ``unitTest``, Leo will call that function when
doing unit testing for plugins. So it would be good if writers of plugins would
create such a ``unitTest function``. To indicate a failure the ``unitTest`` just
throws an exception. Leo's plugins test suite takes care of the rest.

Turning script buttons into plugins
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section provides step-by-step instructions for turning a script button into a plugin.
The plugin will define a minibuffer command that does the same thing as pressing the button.

We shall start with a script button whose script is::
    
    g.es_print('c: %s' % (c.fileName()),color='red')
    g.es_print('p: %s' % (p.h),color='red')
    
Not very exciting, but it uses the predefined ``c`` and ``p`` constants.
Our plugin will create a minibuffer command called print-cp.

Here are the step-by-step instructions:
    
1. Open leoPlugins.leo and use the Copy Node command to copy the tree at:
    
Plugins--> Templates: these show recommended ways of defining plugins.-->Template for Tk plugin with per-commander controller class

2. Paste the tree somewhere else and rename it to @thin print_cp.py.
   I copied the tree to::
        
    Plugins-->Example code-->@thin print_cp.py

3. Update the docstring, the __version__ constant and the << imports >> section.
   Note that unlike when using script buttons, you must have the following imports::
       
    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g
    import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
    
4. Because this plugin doesn't require any gui interface, we simplify the ``init`` function::
    
    def init ():
        leoPlugins.registerHandler('after-create-leo-frame',onCreate)
        return True

   The init function registers the onCreate hook and
   returns True to indicate that it loaded properly.
   
5. Leave the ``onCreate`` function unchanged.
   It creates a per-commander instance of the pluginController class.
   This class exists mainly to bind self.c properly to a commander.
   
6. Change the constructor (__init__ method) of the pluginController class to this::
    
    def __init__ (self,c):
        self.c = c
        c.k.registerCommand('print-cp',shortcut=None,func=self.print_cp)
        script = "c.k.simulateCommand('print-cp')"
        g.app.gui.makeScriptButton(c,script=script,buttonText='Print c & p',bg='red')
        
   This registers the print_cp *method* of the pluginController class as the print-cp minibuffer command,
   and creates a script button with the following script::
       
       c.k.simulateCommand('print-cp')
   
7. Define the print_cp method as follows::
    
    def print_cp (self,event=None):
        c = self.c ; p = c.p
        g.es_print('c: %s' % (c.fileName()),color='red')
        g.es_print('p: %s' % (p.h),color='red')
        
   The print_cp method must have the event argument as shown because it implements a minibuffer command.
   The print_cp method gets the proper commander from the ``c`` ivar (instance variable) and computes
   the current position ``p`` as shown.
   
8. Enable the print_cp plugin by putting the following in an @enabled-plugins node::
    
    print_cp.py

9. Test the plugin by restarting Leo (I just start test.leo).
   You can test the plugin by pressing the 'Print c&p' button
   or by typing <Alt-x> print-cp <Return>.
   
That's all.  You can find the completed version of the print_cp plugin in leoPlugins.leo,
or leoPluginsRef.leo if you are using cvs.

Important security warnings
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Naively using plugins can expose you and your .leo files to malicious attacks.
The fundamental principles are::

    Scripts and plugins must never blindly execute code from untrusted sources.

and::

    .leo files obtained from other people may potentially contain hostile code.

Stephen Schaefer summarizes the danger this way::

    I foresee a future in which the majority of leo projects come from
    marginally trusted sources...a world of leo documents sent hither and yon -
    resumes, project proposals, textbooks, magazines, contracts - and as a race
    of Pandora's, we cannot resist wanting to see "What's in the box?" And are
    we going to fire up a text editor to make a detailed examination of the
    ASCII XML? Never! We're going to double click on the cute leo file icon, and
    leo will fire up in all its raging glory. Just like Word (and its macros) or
    Excel (and its macros).

In other words::

    When we share "our" .leo files we can NOT assume that
    we know what is in our "own" documents!

Not all environments are untrustworthy. Code in a commercial cvs repository is
probably trustworthy: employees might be terminated for posting malicious code.
Still, the potential for abuse exists anywhere.

In Python it is very easy to write a script that will blindly execute other scripts::

    # Warning: extremely dangerous code

    # Execute the body text of all nodes that start with `@script`.
    def onLoadFile():
        for p in c.allNodes_iter():
            h = p.h.lower()
            if g.match_word(h,0,"@script"):
                s = p.b
                if s and len(s) > 0:
                    try: # SECURITY BREACH: s may be malicious!
                        exec(s + '\n')
                    except:
                        es_exception()

Executing this kind of code is typically an intolerable security risk.
**Important**: rexec provides *no protection whatever*.
Leo is a repository of source code, so any text operation is potentially malicious.
For example, consider the following script, which is valid in rexec mode::

    badNode = c.p
    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        << change `rexec` to `exec` in p's body >>
    << delete badNode >>
    << clear the undo stack >>

This script will introduce a security hole the .leo file without doing anything
prohibited by rexec, and without leaving any traces of the perpetrating script
behind. The damage will become permanent *outside* this script when the user
saves the .leo file.
