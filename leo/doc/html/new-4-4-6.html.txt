New commands
++++++++++++

::

    find-next-clone
    toggle-sparse-move

Replaced the delete-all-icons command with a script in scripts.leo.  This command was too dangerous.

New features
++++++++++++

- Added support for @auto xml and @auto javascript.
  Use @data import_xml_tags setting to specify the xml tags that act as organizers.
  Javascript regexps that look like section references cause problems, but that can not be helped.

New settings
++++++++++++

- Added support for @data nodes in settings files.

- The @data import_xml_tags setting specifies the xml tags that act as organizers.
  This settings is used by @auto when importing xml files.
