**Important**: We often refer to outline_ nodes_ by the directives_ they contain.
For example, an `@root node`_ is a node containing an @root directive_, etc.
**Exception**: An `@file node`_ is a node whose *headline* starts with ``@file``.

.. _`@auto node`:
.. _`@file node`:
.. _`@thin node`:
.. _`@root node`:
.. _`@file nodes`:
.. _`@thin nodes`:
.. _`@root nodes`:

``@file node``
    An ``@file`` node_ is a node whose *headline* starts with ``@file``.
    **Important**: Headlines_ that start with ``@file-asis``, ``@file-noref``, ``@file-nosent``
    (and their abbreviations ``@asis``, ``@noref``, ``@nosent``) are collectively called ``@file`` nodes.

.. _`@auto tree`:
.. _`@file tree`:
.. _`@thin tree`:
.. _`@root tree`:
.. _`@file trees`:
.. _`@shadow trees`:
.. _`@thin trees`:
.. _`@root trees`:

``@file tree, @others tree, @root tree, etc.``
    An @file tree_ is a tree whose root_ is an @file node, etc.

``@asis, @auto, @file, @noref, @nosent, @thin``
    Headlines_ that start with one of these create (correspond to) `derived files`_.
    The following synonyms exist::

        @asis, @file-asis
        @noref, @file-noref
        @nosent, @file-nosent

    For more information, see the documentation for `@asis`_, `@auto`_, `@file`_, `@noref`_, `@nosent`_ and `@thin`_
    in Leo's `programming reference`_ chapter.

    \@auto trees allow you to edit derived files that contain no sentinels.
    Leo will import the @auto files when reading .leo files.  Be careful when first creating the @auto node.
    *Before* saving the .leo file containing the new @auto node,
    use the read-at-auto-nodes command to do the initial import.

.. _`@all`:
.. _`@all directive`:

``@all``
    A directive_ that copies the `body text`_ of all nodes_ in an `@thin` tree to the corresponding `derived file`_.

.. _`@others`:
.. _`@others directive`:

``@others``
    A directive_ that copies the `body text`_ of all nodes_ *except* `section definition nodes`_

    The original and all clones are treated equally:
    no special status is given to the "original" node_.

.. _`clone arrow`:

.. _`code parts`:

``Code part``
    A part of a `section definition`_ that contains code. 
    Code parts start with ``@c`` or ``@code`` directives_ and continue until the next `doc part`_

.. _contract:
.. _contracts:
.. _contracted:

``Contract``:
    To hide all descendants_ of a node_.

    The file created as the result of tangling_ a node containing an ``@root`` directive_.
    The file consists of the expansion of the text following the ``@root`` directive_.
    For more information, see the `derived files section`_ of `Leo's tutorial`_.

.. _`descendant`:
.. _`descendants`:

``Descendant``
    An offspring_ of a node_.  That is, a child_, grandchild_, etc. of a node.

.. _`directive`:
.. _`directives`:

``Directive``
    A keyword, preceded by an '@' sign, in `body text`_ that controls Leo's operation.
    The keyword is empty for the ``@`` directive.
    For more information, set the `Leo directives`_ section of `Leo's tutorial`_.

.. _`doc part`:
.. _`doc parts`:

``Doc part, @doc part, document part, etc.``
    A part_ of a `section definition`_ that contains comments.
    Doc parts start with ``@`` and continue until the ``@c`` directive_ or the end of the `body text`_.
    In `@root trees`_, doc parts are associated with the immediately following `code part`_, if any.

.. _`escape convention`:
.. _`escape conventions`:

``Escape convention``
    A convention for representing sequences of characters that would otherwise have special meaning.
    Leo has only one such convention:
    in `@root trees`_, ``@@`` in the leftmost column of a `code part`_ stands for a single ``@`` character.
    **Important**:
    Leo does not support `noweb's`_ ``@<<`` and ``@>>`` escape conventions.
    Any line containing matched ``<<`` and ``>>`` is a `section reference`_, regardless of context.
    To use ``<<`` and ``>>`` as ordinary characters, place them on separate lines.

``Hoist & dehoist``
    Hoisting a node_ redraws the screen that node and its descendants_ becomes the only visible part of the outline_.
    Leo prevents the you from moving nodes outside the hoisted outline.  Dehoisting a node restores the outline.
    Multiple hoists may be in effect: each dehoist undoes the effect of the immediately preceding hoist.

.. _`icon box`:
.. _`icon boxes`:

.. _`LaTex`:

``LaTex``
    A markup language often used in `literate programming` environments.
    See: http://www.latex-project.org/

    and indicating whether the node contains `body text`_.

.. _`Leo1`:
.. _`Leo2`:

``Leo1 and Leo2``
    **Leo1** denotes all versions of Leo that write version 1 .leo files, that is,
    all Windows version of Leo prior to version 2.0.
    The last version of Leo1, version 1.15, understands enough about Leo2 to issue a warning when opening version 2 files.

    **Leo2** denotes all versions of Leo that write version 2 .leo files, that is,
    all versions of leo.py and all Windows versions with version number 2.0 and above.
    Only Leo2 can generate `derived files`_ from `@file trees`_.

.. _`literate programming`:

``Literate programming``
    A style of programming that aims at producing the highest quality program listings.
    Literate programming languages apply two fundamental operations to text: weaving_ and tangling_.
    Leo supports two literate programming languages, `CWEB`_ and `noweb`_.
    For more links see the `literate programming web page`_.

.. _`mark`:
.. _`marks`:

``Mark``
    A red vertical line in the `icon box`_ of a node_.

.. _node:
.. _nodes:

``Node``

    Sometimes used as a synonym for tree_.

.. _`noweb`:
.. _`noweb's`:

``noweb``
    A literate programming language invented by Norman Ramsey.
    The `noweb language`_ can produce `derived files`_ for any text-based programming language.

.. _`organizer nodes`:

``Organizing node``, ``organizer node``
    A node_ containing no `body text`_.
    Organizing nodes may appear anywhere in an `@file tree`_; they do not affect the derived file in any way.
    In particular, organizing nodes do not affect indentation in `derived files`_.

.. _`orphan`:
.. _`orphan node`:
.. _`orphan nodes`:

``Orphan node``
    A node_ that would not be copied to a `derived file`_.
    Orphan nodes can arise because an `@thin tree`_ has no ``@others`` or ``@all`` directives_.
    Sections_ that are defined but not used also create orphan nodes.

    Leo issues a warning when attempting to write an `@thin tree`_ containing orphan nodes,
    and does not save the `derived file`_.
    No information is lost; Leo saves the information in the `@thin tree`_ in the .leo file.
    Leo will load the `@thin tree`_ from the .leo file the next time Leo opens the .leo file.

.. _`outline`:
.. _`outliner`:

.. _`sentinel`:
.. _`sentinels`:
.. _`sentinel lines`:

``Sentinels, sentinel lines``
    Comment lines in files derived from `@file nodes`_.
    Such lines start with an ``@`` following the opening comment delimiter.
    Sentinels embed outline structure into `derived files`_.
    **Do not alter sentinel lines**.  Doing so can corrupt the outline structure.
    For more information see `Sentinel lines`_ in `Leo's tutorial`_.

.. _`@settings`:
.. _`setting`:
.. _`settings`:

``Setting``:
    Plugins_ and other parts of Leo can get options from ``@settings`` trees,
    outlines_ whose headline_ is ``@settings``. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks
    for ``@settings`` trees in the outline being opened and also in various
    ``leoSettings.leo files``. ``@settings`` trees allow plugins_ to get options without
    any further support from Leo's core code. For a full discussion of
    @settings trees, see `Chapter 8: Customizing Leo`_.

.. _`sibling`:
.. _`siblings`:

.. _`tangle`:
.. _`tangles`:
.. _`tangling`:

``Tangling``
    The process of creating `derived files`_ from `@root trees`_ or `@file trees`_.
    Leo tangles `@file trees`_ automatically when writing a .leo file.
    You must explicitly tangle_ `@root trees`_ using the ``Tangle`` command.
    Tangling expands all `section references` in an `@root node`_ or `@file node`_.
    For more information, see `Tangling @root trees`_ in Leo's `programming reference`_.

.. _`target language`:

``Target language``

    An outline_.
    A node_ and its descendants_.

.. _`untangle`:
.. _`untangles`:
.. _`untangling`:

``Untangling``
    Updating an outline_ based on changes to `derived files`_.
    Untangling allows changes to be propagated from derived files back to the outline.
    Especially useful when fixing syntax errors outside Leo.
    For more information, see `Untangling @root trees`_ in Leo's `programming reference`_.

.. _`weave`:
.. _`weaves`:
.. _`weaving`:

.. _`view node`:
.. _`view nodes`:

``View node``
    A `node`_ that represents a view of an `outline`_.
    View nodes are typically ordinary, non-`cloned`_ nodes that contain cloned `descendant`_ nodes.
    The cloned descendant nodes comprise most of the data of the view.
    Other non-cloned nodes may add additional information to the view.
    See `clones & views`_ in the `Leo's tutorial`_ for more information.

``Weaving``
    The process of creating typeset documentation from a noweb_ or CWEB_ source file.
    Weaving creates documentation. Tangling_ creates `derived files`_.
    Leo does not support weaving directly.
    To weave a file you can create noweb_ or CWEB_ files using Leo's ``Export`` commands,
    then use the noweb_ or CWEB_ systems to weave those files.
