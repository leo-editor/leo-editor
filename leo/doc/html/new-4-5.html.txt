Major new features
++++++++++++++++++


- Added support for @shadow files.
  This is a major breakthrough.
  See `Chapter 23`_ for full details.

- Added much improved support for vim bindings.

- Allow v.uA's in @thin and @shadow nodes.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/750bb3099090f5b

Major code reorganizations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++


- Leo now uses a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This makes it possible to extend Leo's file format without invalidating previous versions of Leo.

- Leo now supports the so-called 'Graph World'.
  When g.unified_nodes is True, Leo moves all information from tnodes into vnodes.

- Leo now uses a new key binding scheme.
  This allows substantially simpler key bindings. Indeed, most per-pane bindings
  have been eliminated.
  Added support for kill bindings.

- Leo is now an installable package.
  To make this work, Leo adds os.curdir to sys.path if needed on startup.

- Reorganized Leo's drawing and focus code.
  As a result, calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate are no longer needed.

- Leo is now ready for Python 3.x:
  Change most print statements to calls to g.pr.

Minor new features
++++++++++++++++++


- Added g.Tracer class.  This is a Python 'debugger' that computes a call graph.
  To trace a function and its callers, put the following at the function's start::

    g.startTracer()

- The find-character command now finds characters across line boundaries.

- Set cwd in read/write commands. This affect the following commands:
  open, save, save-as, save-to, read-outline-only, read-file-into-node,
  write-file-from-node and all the import/export commands.

- Leo creates the .leo folder in the user's HOME directory, and puts several configuration files there.
  Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo in HOME/.leo.
  Leo uses os.path.expanduser("~") if there is no home setting.

New settings
++++++++++++


- The default settings for @shadow files are now located in leoSettings.leo in the node::

    @settings-->File options-->Shadow files

  The defaults for these settings are::

    @string shadow_prefix = x
    @string shadow_subdir = .leo_shadow

- Added support for @bool fixedWindow option. Leo suppresses marks, expansion
  state, orphan bits and current position bits when writing fixed .leo files. As
  a result, all nodes will be collapsed and the root node will always be
  selected when Leo opens a fixed .leo file.

  You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of fixed .leo
  files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
  @settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
  **not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
  opens the file would get that fixed position.

  The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
  something like this::

    # Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
    # Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.

    1200
    800
    50
    50

- Added @bool cleo_color_ignore = True
  This determines whether cleo colors @ignore headlines. The default is True.
