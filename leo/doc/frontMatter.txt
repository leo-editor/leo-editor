Leo_ has thousands of users_. Like me, many of them would never willingly be without Leo again.
Here are Leo's essential features:

1.  Leo outlines_ show you the big picture at all times,
    while providing unlimited space for details.

2.  Leo outlines_ can organize any kind of data:
    computer programs, web sites, documentation, pictures, whatever.

3.  Clones_ allow multiple views of the data within a *single* outline_.
    You don't have to choose the 'correct' view; you can see data in many ways.

4.  Plugins_ allow Leo's users to add new features to Leo.
    Many of Leo's most successful features started life this way.

5.  Leo is a superb scripting_ environment for Python.
    Scripts contained in a Leo outline_ have easy access to all the outline's data.
    It is natural to organize Leo outlines to make life easier for scripts.

6.  Leo is `Open Software`_, written in 100% pure Python_.
    Leo runs wherever Python does.

Leo has a strong and active community of users on `SourceForge`_.
Working with this community has been a constant source of joy and inspiration.
Suggestions and plugins from users continue to drive Leo in excellent new directions.
Who knows what the next plugin will bring? -- Edward K. Ream, September, 2005
