.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.2: *3* Overview
reStructuredText_ (rST) is a popular markup language for writing documents. rST
is simple, yet powerful. All of Leo's documentation is written in rST, and then
processed via the docutils_ and Sphinx_ processors to produce Leo's web pages.

Leo makes writing rST documents easier. A *lot* easier. There are several
reasons for this:

1. Leo outlines help organize rST source code in all the usual ways. You always
clearly see the structure of even book-length documents. You can rearrange and
reorganize chapters, sections and paragraphs effortlessly. You can use clones to
create multiple views of your writing for yourself and your readers. These
capabilities, all by themselves, would make Leo an excellent choice for editing
rST documents.

2. Leo fixes the clumsiest part of rST markup, namely the markup for headings.
Without Leo, you must underline heading lines manually. The underlining
character indicates the level of a heading. Changing the level of a heading is
clumsy and error prone: you must change the underlining character properly.
Changing the level of several headings is a headache.

Leo gets rid of all this bother. Within an outline that gets written to an
external rST file, Leo's headlines become section headings. When writing
external rST files, **Leo generates underlining for headers automatically**
based on the outline level of the outline nodes. When you rearrange your outline
Leo will recompute the rST markup needed to recreate the outline structure in
the external rST file. In most cases, you won't even see the rST markup for
headings!

3. @auto-rst nodes allow you to edit exising rST files in Leo. The outline
structure of such nodes mirrors the level of the rST section headings. Note:
there may be minor variations the first time you import an existing rST file,
but these differences will not affect the meaning of the rST file. After the
first import, the only changes when writing the imported rST file will be
changes *you* make.

The three features just discussed (Leo's organizational capabilities, automatic
generation of markup for rST headings, and @auto-rst trees) are useful for
anyone using reStructuredText. In addition Leo provides additional capabilities
for power users:

4. @rst trees can contain settings that affect how Leo writes individual nodes.

@rst trees allows the ultimate in flexible formating.
We'll discuss these options in detail later, but here are a few examples.

- Headlines that starts with @rst-no-head do not create an rST heading.

- Body text that starts with::

    @rst-option code_mode = True

causes the body text of the node to be displayed as an rST code block.

Leo's rst3 command generates .htm, .html or .tex output files from @rst tree,
provided that you have installed Python's docutils_ module.  The rst3 command
will use the SilverCity_ syntax coloring package if it installed.

The rst3 command sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.
See `Required cascading style sheets`_ for more details.

5. The rST options just discussed will suffice to create just about any kind of
rST output. But for those desiring the ultimate in flexibility, it is relatively
straightforward to create Leo outlines or external files using scripts. For
example, you might want to write a script to format source code to rST markup. A
script can give you complete control over such formatting. This chapter
concludes by telling how to write such scripts.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.3: *3* Power features of @rst trees
1. The rst3 command allows much more flexible control over its operations using
**rst options**. You can set options in @settings trees, in headlines and in
body text. Nodes inherit most rst3 options from ancestor nodes much like nodes
inherit Leo directives. See `Options`_.

The most important option is the code_mode option. This option specifies whether
to process the body text of a node as rst markup (rst mode) or source code that
is to be converted to rST markup (code mode). Any node can be processed in any mode.

2. Headlines can set any option. This turns out to be very convenient. See
`Headline commands`_ for details. Nodes whose headlines start with @rst-options
are treated specially. The body text of such **rst options nodes** should
contain nothing but lines of the form::

    <option>=<value>

3. You can set any rst options in the *body text* of any node using doc parts
of the form::

    @ @rst-options
    list of rst options, one per line
    @c

Such **option doc parts** allows you to specify rst options even with source code files.

4. You can embed rST markup in the body text of any node using doc parts of the
form::

    @ @rst-markup
    any rST markup
    @c

Such **markup doc parts** allow you to fine-tune the formatting of your source files.
See `Using doc parts`_ for full details.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.4: *3* Options
You can set any option in any node, so you have complete control over how the
rst3 command processes each node. The following is a list of options that
control how the rst3 command formats each particular node.

code_mode (default: False)
    True: process nodes in code mode.  False: process nodes in rst mode.
    In code mode, the rst3 command automatically creates rST markup to display the body text as an
    rst code-block. In rst mode the rst3 simply copies the body text of the node to the output. That
    is, the rst3 command assumes that body text is already valid rST markup.

doc_only_mode (default: False)
    True: process nodes in doc_only mode.
    False: process nodes in rst mode or code_mode, depending on options.
    In doc_only mode, the rst3 command outputs only regular doc parts and @ @rst-markup doc parts.
    Headlines create section in doc_only mode only if
    a\) the node contains a doc part or b\) the show_organizer_nodes option is in effect.
    As always can use @ @rst-options for per-node control of the process,
    especially node-by-node control of the show_organizer_nodes option.

default_path (default: '')
    The path to be prepended to filenames given in root nodes.

default_encoding (default: utf-8)
    The default encoding to be used for non-ascii (unicode characters).

encoding (default: the default_encoding setting)
    The encoding to be used for non-ascii (unicode) characters.
    **Important**: this option has effect only in @rst-options doc parts
    in root @rst nodes.

generate_rst (default: True)
    A master switch.
    True: generate rST markup for rST sections and rST code-blocks.
    False: don't generate rST markup and ignore @ @rst-markup doc parts.

generate_rst_header_comment (default: True)

    This option has effect only if the generate_rst and write_intermediate_file
    options are both True. When this option is in effect, Leo writes a comment
    line of the form::

        .. rst3: filename: <filename>

    at the start of intermediate files.

number_code_lines (default: True)
    Controls whether to number code lines in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

publish-argv-for-missing-stylesheets (Default: '')
    The arguments to be passed to docutils.core.Publisher().publish()
    when no stylesheet is in effect.
    This is a string that represents a comma-separated list of strings:
    For example, the option::

        publish-argv-for-missing-stylesheets=--language=de,--documentclass=report,--use-latex-toc

    results in the call::

        publish(['--language=de','--documentclass=report','--use-latex-toc'])

show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs (default: False)
    True: Move doc parts outside of the code-block directive in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.
    **Cool**: Any rST markup in doc parts included as the result of this option will be rendered properly.

show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode (default: True)
    This option is most useful for rst documents which are not computer code.
    It allows you to use doc parts to make comments on the draft document
    which are either excluded from the output or formatted in a way that highlights
    their nature as comments rather than contet.  For example, you're writing a book, and
    you want to use a doc part at the top of a section to remind yourself "need
    to explain how Ted got to Sally's".    Note: you may need to add
    CSS to have them formatted differently.  The option can be `True`, `False`,
    or one or more class names.

    True: doc parts have no special significance in rst mode.
    That is, the entire doc part from the opening '@' to the closing '@c
    and everything in between are treated as normal rST markup.

    False: doc parts are removed from the output in rst mode

    class name(s):

      The contents of the doc part is processed as it if was in an rst `container`
      directive.  For example::

         @ @rst-options
         show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode = notes literal
         @c

      would wrap the doc part contents in the output in a div with classes
      "container notes literal".  Furthermore, if one of the class names is
      `literal`, then the doc part content will be output as a literal block
      wrapped in a container as described above.  This allows you to use text
      which is not valid rst as rough notes for annotating a draft document.

show_headlines (default: True)
    True: automatically generate rST sections from headlines.
    Applies to both code mode and rst mode.
    The level of the node in the outline determines the level of the section
    underling in the rST markup. Higher-level headlines in the outline
    correspond to higher-level section headings; lower-level headlines in the
    outline correspond to lower-level section headings.

show_leo_directives (default: True)
    True: include Leo directives in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_markup_doc_parts (default: False)
    True: include markup doc parts in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_options_doc_parts (default: False)
    True: include options doc parts in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_options_nodes (default: False)
    True: show @rst-options nodes.

show_organizer_nodes (default: True)
    True: generate rST sections for nodes that do not contain body text.
    This option has no effect unless the rST section would otherwise be written.

show_sections (default: True)
    True: generate rST sections corresponding to headlines.
    False: don't generate sections.  Instead, generate lines of the form::

        **headline**

strip_at_file_prefixes (default: True)
    True: remove @auto, @file, @nosent and @thin from the start of headlines.

stylesheet_name (default: 'default.css')
    The name of the stylesheet passed to docutils.

stylesheet_path (default: '')
    The directory containing the stylesheet passed to docutils.

    :Note:
        If the stylesheet_embed option is True, specify a path relative
        to the location of the Leo file.  If the stylesheet_embed option is
        False, specify a path relative to the location of the HTML file.

stylesheet_embed (default: True)
    | True: The content of the stylesheet file will be embedded in the HTML file.
    | False: The HTML file will link to an external stylesheet file.

underline_characters (default: \'\'\'#=+*^~"'\`-:><\_\'\'\')
    The underlining characters to be used to specify rST sections.
    The first character is reserved so you can specify the top-level section explicitly.

verbose (default: True)
    True: write informational messages.

write_intermediate_file (default: False)
    True: writes intermediate files before sending them to docutils.
    This option only applies to .htm, .html and .tex files.
    The name of the intermediate file has the name of the output file with .txt appended.
    This option has effect only if the generate_rst option is True.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.5: *4* Options supporting the http plugin
The following options are for the use of Bernhard Mulder's http plugin. The http
plugin creates an http server running on a local port, typically 8080. When the
http plugin is running you will see a purple message in the log window that
looks something like this::

    http serving enabled on port 8080, version 0.91

To use the http plugin, start a web browser and enter this url::

    http://localhost:8080/

You will see a a top level page containing one link for every open .leo file.  Clicking on link will cause the http server to pass a new page to the browser.  You can use the browser's refresh button to update the top-level view in the browser after you have opened or closed files.

**Important**: See the docstring for the http plugin for information on
configuring the plugin. Some of the following rst3 settings must match values of
settings for the http plugin. Here are the rst3 options that support the http
plugin:

http_server_support (default: False)
    A master switch: none of the following options have any effect unless this option is True.
    If True, the rst3 command does the following:

    - Writes **node markers** in the rst output for use by the http plugin. Node markers are rst named hyperlink targets.  By default they look like::

            .. _http-node-marker-N

      where N is a unique node number.

    - Adds additional information to all nodes of the tree being formatted using Leo's
      unknownAttributes mechanism.

http_attributename (default: 'rst_http_attribute')
    The name of the attribute name written to the unknownAttributes attribute of
    each each outline node in the rst root tree.
    The default is 'rst_http_attribute';
    it should match the following setting of the *http* plugin::

        @string rst_http_attributename = 'rst_http_attribute'

    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.

clear_http_attributes (default: False)
    If True the rst3 command initially clears the fields specified by `http_attributename`.  
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.

node_begin_marker (default: 'http-node-marker-')
    The string used for node markers.
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.6: *4* Options that set command names
The following options specify the 'spelling' of headline commands. The
option_prefix and option_prefixes command also define the spelling of special
doc parts.

You can change these to make them shorter or to avoid conflicts with headlines
in your Leo files. The list below merely gives the default value for each
setting.

`code_prefix`: '\@rst-code'

`ignore_headline_prefix`: '\@rst-no-head'

`ignore_headlines_prefix`: '\@rst-no-headlines'

`ignore_prefix_tree`: '\@rst-ignore'

`ignore_node_prefix`: '\@rst-ignore-node'

`ignore_tree_prefix`: '\@rst-ignore-tree'

`option_prefix`: '\@rst-option'

`options_prefix`: '\@rst-options'

`preformat_prefix`: '\@rst-preformat'

`rst_prefix`: '\@rst'

`show_headline_prefix`: '\@rst-head'
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.7: *3* Headline Commands
It is often convenient to set options in headlines.  This is done with the following **headline commands**:

@rst TEXT
    Enter rst mode.  Create a section called TEXT provided the show_headlines option is set.

@rst-code TEXT
    Enter code mode.  Create a section called TEXT provided the show_headlines option is set.

@rst-ignore-node TEXT
    Suppress all output from a single node. TEXT is ignored.
    Has *no* effect on descendant nodes and does **not** change any rst3 option. 

@rst-ignore-tree TEXT and @rst-ignore TEXT
    Suppress all output from the node and its descendants.  TEXT is ignored.
    Does **not** change any rst3 formatting option.

@rst-no-head TEXT
    Suppress the generation of an rST section for this node only.  Does not affect descendant nodes.
    Has *no* effect on descendant nodes and does **not** change any rst3 option. 

@rst-no-headlines TEXT
    Set the show_headlines option to False.  As a result, TEXT is ignored.

@rst-option <option> = <value>
    Set a single option to the given value.  The default value is True.

@rst-options TEXT
    Set zero or more options from the body text of the node.  TEXT is ignored.
    The entire body text is treated as if it were in an @ @rst-options doc part.

@rst-preformat TEXT
    Format the entire body text of the node as if the entire text preformatted.
    TEXT is ignored. In effect, a line containing '::' is added to the start of
    the text, and all following lines of the text are indented. This option has
    no effect on descendant nodes.

**Notes**:

- Several of these commands affect only the node in which they appear.  Such commands set internal settings variables only: they have no effect on the visible rst3 options.

- If a headline generates an rST section, the section name does not include the headline command.  Furthermore, no rST section is generated if the TEXT is empty.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.8: *3* Using doc parts
Recall that in Leo a doc part starts with the '@' directive and continues until the end of body text or until the '@c' directive is seen.  For example::

    @ This is a comment in a doc part.
    Doc parts can span multiple lines.
    The next line ends the doc part
    @c

Leo converts doc parts into comments using whatever comment delimiters are in effect.

**Option doc parts** are doc parts that start with @ @rst-options. All other
lines of such doc parts should be of the form name=value. (rST comments lines
starting with '..' are allowed). For example::

    @ @rst-options
    .. This comment line is ignored.
    show_headlines=False
    show_leo_directives=False
    verbose=True
    @c

The rst3 command sets options from option doc parts, even in code mode.

**Markup doc parts** are doc parts that start with @ @rst-markup.  For example::

    @ @rst-markup
    .. contents::

The rst3 command replaces markup doc parts by the markup they contain, even in
code mode.

Option and markup doc parts are especially useful in code mode. They allow you
to specify options or insert rST markup directly from with external files. This
makes your source files self contained: there is no need to add other nodes to
make the rst3 command happy.

A cool feature: In code mode, rST markup in *ordinary* doc parts will be
rendered properly when the show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs option is in effect.
*Important*: Regardless of the show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs option, doc parts
have no special significance in rst mode. That is, the entire `doc part` from
the opening '@' to the closing '@c and everything in between are treated as normal
rST markup.  *Update:* you can now use the `show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode` option
to change this behavior and control the processing of doc parts in rst mode.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.9: *3* Setting defaults
You can set the defaults for any rst3 option in several ways:

\1.  By setting options in the root node using @ @rst-options doc parts.
For example, the root of the file that generated this documentation contains::

    @ @rst-options
    code_mode=False
    doc_mode_only=False
    generate_rst=True
    show_organizer_nodes=True
    show_headlines=True
    show_leo_directives=True
    verbose=True
    @c

\2. By setting options in @settings trees.  To do this, you must prefix the option name shown in this documentation with the prefix 'rst3\_'.  For example::

    @settings
        @bool rst3_write_intermediate_file = True
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.10: *3* The code-block directive
The rst3 command defines a code-block rST directive. The primary purpose of this
directive is to show formatted source code.

In rst mode you can insert the code-block directive like any other rST markup.
The rst3 command generates code-block directives when handling nodes in code
mode.

This directive takes one argument, a language name.  Like this::

    .. code-block:: Python

        import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
        import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

This directive syntax colors the code in the indented code block that follows the directive.
The result looks like this if the SilverCity syntax coloring module has been installed.

.. .. code-block:: Python

    .. import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
    .. import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

.. Otherwise, the output looks like this::

    .. import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
    .. import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

See the Scripting chapter in LeoDocs.leo for many examples of how to use
code-blocks.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.11: *3* Required cascading style sheets
HTML files generated by the rst3 command assume that three .css (cascading style
sheet) files exist in the same directory. For the HTML output to look good the
following .css files should exist:

- default.css is the default style sheet that docutils expects to exist.

- leo_rst.css contains some style improvements based on Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory.

- silver_city.css is the style sheet that controls the syntax highlighting generated by SilverCity.

The latter two style sheets are imported at the end of the default.css.

**Important:** You can use cascading style sheets to do things that otherwise
wouldn't be possible with "plain" rST. For instance, the background color of
this page was specified in a body style.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.12: *3* Notes about rST markup
Leo reserves the '#' character for your own use so that you can
specify an rST headline explicitly. For example,::

    #####
    Title
    #####

You would typically put such a title in the rst root node. Otherwise, you should
let the rst3 command automatically generate rST sections from headlines.

To create a table of contents (TOC) put::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents

on its own line wherever you want the TOC to appear.  This line can appear in body text in rst mode,
or in an @ @rst-markup doc part in code mode.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.13: *3* Examples
The file ListManagerDocs.html_ is an impressive example of the kind of output
that can be generated relatively easily using the rst3 command.

The source for ListManagerDocs.html is wxListManager.leo_. **Important**:
wxListManager.leo was written for the old rst2 plugin; it could be greatly
simplified if adapted for the rst3 command.

The files in LeoDocs.leo under the node 'Leo's HTML Users Guide' contain
examples of using the rst3 command.

This documentation was created using the rst3 command. The source code for this
documentation is in LeoDocs.leo. The source code for all the rst3 command is in
leoRst.py in leoPy.leo.
.. @+node:ekr.20050818163826.14: *3* Theory of operation
The code for the rst3 command is more complex than usual. Fortunately, the
overall organization is straightforward.

defaultOptionsDict
    This dictionary represents each rst3 option.
    To add another option, just add another entry to this dictionary.
    Keys are the option name, including the `rst3_` prefix.
    Values are the default value of the option.
    The hard values in the dictionary may be changed as the result of @settings entries.

processTree
    processTree is the top-level code that handles one rst root node.
    It calls preprocessTree to create the **tnodeOptionDict** ivar.
    processTree then calls either writeNormalTree or writeSpecialTree
    depending on whether text will be sent to docutils for further processing.
    These two methods handle mundane details of opening an closing files.
    Both writeNormalTree and writeSpecialTree call **writeTree** to do the actual work.

tnodeOptionDict
    The entries in this dictionary represents the options that are set in one particular node.
    The keys of tnodeOptionDict are tnodes, the values are anonymous dictionaries.
    These anonymous inner dictionaries contain the options that are explicitly set at each tnode
    (and thus each position).
    Preprocessing the tree this way ensures that each node (headline and body text) is parsed exactly once.

writeTree
    writeTree first calls **scanAllOptions**, which has the effect of
    initializing all options. writeTree then calls **writeNode** for each node
    that will be processed by the rst3 command. Options may cause the rst3 command to
    skip a node or an entire subtree.

writeNode
    writeNode first calls **scanAllOptions** to compute the options that are in
    effect for that *single* node. Once options have computed, processing the
    node is straightforward. writeNode calls writeBody and writeHeadline
    to do the real work. These methods generate or skip text based on various
    options.

scanAllOptions
    scanAllOptions recreates the optionsDict ivar to represent *all* the options
    in effect for *for the particular node being processed by writeNode*. Client
    code gets these options by calling the getOption method.

    scanAllOptions first inits all options from settings,
    then updates those options using the anonymous
    dictionaries contained in the tnodeOptionsDict.
    scanAllOptions works like g.scanAllDirectives, but the code is much simpler.
.. @+node:ekr.20060527103630: *3* Controlling the rst3 command from scripts
A new method has been added to make it more easily to write rST code from scripts::

    c.rstCommands.writeNodeToString(p)

writeNodeToString scans p's tree (p defaults to presently selected node) looking for @rst nodes.
When the first @rst node is found, writeNodeToString processes the node as usual, with the following changes:

- @rst need not be followed by a filename; any filename and its extension are *ignored*.

- Only the ext argument to writeNodeToString determines the type of output produced.
  The valid values for the ext argument are None (for rst output), '.html', '.pdf', and '.tex'.

- Instead of writing the result to a file, writeNodeToString returns the tuple (p,s),
  where p is the node whose tree produced the output, and s is the output itself.

- writeNodeToString returns after processing at most one @rst node.

Scripts can easily use writeNodeToString to convert @rst trees into various kinds of output.
For example::

    p,s = c.rstCommands.writeNodeToString(p,ext='html')

Notes:

- This script scans the presently selected tree for @rst nodes.
  In particular, if the presently selected tree does not contain an @rst node the search continues in parent trees.
  When an @rst node is found, it converts the node (and descendants) to html and returns p,
  the found @rst node and s, the html itself.

- Valid values for the ext argument are ".html", ".tex" or None (specifies rst output)

- There is some support for ext=".pdf", but this is experimental code.  Expect crashes.
