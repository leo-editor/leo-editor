.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.262: *3* Overview
All versions of Leo are organized as a collection of classes. The general
organization of Leo has remained remarkably stable throughout all versions of
Leo, although the names of classes are different in different versions.
Smalltalk's Model/View/Controller terminology is a good way think about Leo's
classes. **Model classes** represent the fundamental data. The vnode and tnode
classes are Leo's primary model classes.

**View classes** draw the screen. The main view classes are leoFrame.py and
leoTree.py. The colorizer class in leoColor.py handles syntax coloring in the
body pane. Leo's view classes know about data stored in the vnode class. Most
events (keystrokes and mouse actions) in the outline and body pane are handled
in the leoTree class. The leoFrame class also creates the Leo window, including
menus, and dispatches the appropriate members of the controller classes in
response to menu commands.

**Controller classes** (aka commanders) control the application. In Leo,
controllers mostly handle menu commands. Commanders create subcommanders to
handle complex commands. The atFile class reads and writes files derived from
\@file trees. The LeoFind class handles the Find and Change commands. The
leoImportCommands class handles the Import and Export commands, the
tangleCommands class handles the Tangle and Untangle commands and the undoer
class handles the Undo command. Other classes could be considered controller
classes.

Each Leo window has its own commander and subcommanders. Subcommanders are not
subclasses of their commander. Instead, subcommanders know the commander that
created them, and call that commander as needed. Commanders and subcommanders
call the model and view classes as needed. For example, the Commands class
handles outline commands. To move a headline, the commander for the window calls
a vnode move routine to alter the data, then calls the view class to redraw the
screen based on the new data.

A singleton instance of the **LeoApp** class represents the application itself.
All code uses the app() global function to gain access to this singleton member.
The ivars of the LeoApp object are the equivalent of Leo's global variables.
leo.py uses no global Python variables, except the gApp variable returned by
app(). leoGlobals.py defines all application constants. Naturally, most
constants are local to the class that uses them.

Several classes combine aspects of model, view and controller. For example, the
**LeoPrefs** class represents user preferences (model), the Preference Panel
(view) and the Preferences menu command (controller). Similarly, the **LeoFind**
class represents find settings, the Find/Change dialog, and the Find/Change
commands.

We use the following convention throughout this documentation. Any variable
named c is a commander, i.e., an instance of the Commands class in
leoCommands.py. Variables named v and t are vnodes and tnodes respectively.
These classes are defined in leoNodes.py.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.263: *3* Nodes
The vnode and tnode classes represent most of the data contained in the outline.
These classes are Leo's fundamental Model classes. A **vnode** (visual node)
represents a headline at a particular location on the screen. When a headline is
cloned, vnodes must be copied. vnodes persist even if they are not drawn on the
screen. Commanders call vnode routines to insert, delete and move headlines.

The vnode contains data associated with a headline, except the body text data
which is contained in tnodes. A vnode contains headline text, a link to its
tnode and other information. Vnodes contain structure links: parent, firstChild,
next and back ivars. To insert, delete, move or clone a vnode the vnode class
just alters those links. The Commands class calls the **leoTree** class to redraw
the outline pane whenever it changes. The leoTree class knows about these
structure links; in effect, the leoTree and vnode classes work together.

A **tnode**, (text node) represents body text. All vnodes that are clones of
each other share the same tnode. In other words, tnodes are the unit of sharing
of body text. The tnode class is more private than the vnode class. Most
commanders deal only with vnodes, though there are exceptions.

Because Leo has unlimited Undo commands, Leo deletes vnodes and tnodes only when
a window closes. Leo deletes nodes indirectly using destroy methods. Several
classes, including the vnode, tnode, leoFrame and leoTree classes, have
destroy methods. destroy methods merely clear links so that Python's and
Tkinter's reference counting mechanisms will eventually delete vnodes, tnodes
and other data when a window closes.

Leo's XML file format uses **tnode indices** to indicate which tnodes (t
elements) belong to which vnodes (v elements). Such indices are required. Even
if we duplicated the body text of shared tnodes within the file, the file format
would still need an unambiguous way to denote that tnodes are shared. Present
versions of Leo use **gnx's** (global node indices) as node indices. These indices
do not change once a node has created. This reduces cvs conflicts.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.264: *3* Drawing and events
Leo must redraw the outline pane when commands are executed and as the result of mouse and keyboard events.
The main challenges are eliminating flicker and handling events properly.
These topics are interrelated.

**Eliminating flicker**. Leo must update the outline pane with minimum flicker.
Various versions of Leo have approached this problem in different ways. The
drawing code in leo.py is robust, flexible, relatively simple and should work in
almost any conceivable environment. Leo assumes that all code that changes the
outline pane will be enclosed in matching calls to the c.beginUpdate and
c.endUpdate methods of the Commands class. c.beginUpdate() inhibits drawing
until the matching c.endUpdate(). These calls may be nested; only the outermost
call to c.endUpdate() calls c.redraw() to force a redraw of the outline pane.

Code may call c.endUpdate(flag) instead of c.endUpdate(). Leo redraws
the screen only if flag is true. This allows code to suppress redrawing entirely
when needed. For example, here is how the idle_body_key event handler in
leoTree.py conditionally redraws the outline pane::

	redraw_flag = false
  	c.beginUpdate()
	val = v.computeIcon()
	if val != v.iconVal:
		v.iconVal = val
		redraw_flag = true
	c.endUpdate(redraw_flag) # redraw only if necessary

The leoTree class redraws all icons automatically when c.redraw() is called.
This is a major simplification compared to previous versions of Leo. The entire
machinery of drawing icons in the vnode class has been eliminated. The
v.computeIcon method tells what the icon should be. The v.iconVal ivar
tells what the present icon is. The event handler simply compares these two
values and sets redraw_flag if they don't match.

**Handling events.** Besides redrawing the screen, Leo must handle events or
commands that change the text in the outline or body panes. It is surprisingly
difficult to ensure that headline and body text corresponds to the vnode and
tnode corresponding to presently selected outline, and vice versa. For example,
when the user selects a new headline in the outline pane, we must ensure that 1)
the vnode and tnode of the previously selected node have up-to-date information
and 2) the body pane is loaded from the correct data in the corresponding tnode.
Early versions of Leo attempted to satisfy these conditions when the user
switched outline nodes. Such attempts never worked well; there were too many
special cases. Later versions of Leo, including leo.py, use a much more direct
approach. The event handlers make sure that the vnode and tnode corresponding to
the presently selected node are always kept up-to-date. In particular, every
keystroke in the body pane causes the presently selected tnode to be updated
immediately. There is no longer any need for the c.synchVnode method, though
that method still exists for compatibility with old scripts.

The leoTree class contains all the event handlers for the body and outline
panes. The actual work is done in the idle_head_key and idle_body_key methods.
These routines are surprisingly complex; they must handle all the tasks
mentioned above, as well as others. The idle_head_key and idle_body_key methods
should not be called outside the leoTree class. However, it often happens that
code that handles user commands must simulate an event. That is, the code needs
to indicate that headline or body text has changed so that the screen may be
redrawn properly. The leoTree class defines the following simplified event
handlers: onBodyChanged, onBodyWillChange, onBodyKey, onHeadChanged and
onHeadlineKey. Commanders and subcommanders call these event handlers to
indicate that a command has changed, or will change, the headline or body text.
Calling event handlers rather than c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate ensures that
the outline pane is redrawn only when needed.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.265: *3* Clones
New in Leo 4.7. All clones of a node **are the same node**. This is the
so-called **one-node** world. In this world, vnodes represent data, generators
and positions represent the location of the data in an outline.  This is a much
simpler world than all previous data representations.

In Leo versions 4.2 to 4.6 clones were represented by sharing **tnodes**. Cloned
vnodes shared the same tnode. This shared tnode represented the entire shared
subtree of both clones. Thus, the _firstChild link had to reside in
*tnodes*, not *vnodes*.

Prior to Leo version 4.2, Leo duplicated all the descendants of vnode v when
cloning v. This created many complications that were removed in the shared tnode
world. In particular, in the shared tnode scheme a vnode v is cloned if and only
if len(v.vnodeList) > 1.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.266: *3* Find and change commands
The find and change commands are tricky; there are many details that must be
handled properly. The following principles govern the LeoFind class:

1.  Find and Change commands initialize themselves using only the state of the
    present Leo window. In particular, the Find class must not save internal
    state information from one invocation to the next. This means that when the
    user changes the nodes, or selects new text in headline or body text, those
    changes will affect the next invocation of any Find or Change command.
    Failure to follow this principle caused all kinds of problems in the Borland
    and Macintosh codes. There is one exception to this rule: we must remember
    where interactive wrapped searches start. This principle simplifies the code
    because most ivars do not persist. However, each command must ensure that
    the Leo window is left in a state suitable for restarting the incremental
    (interactive) Find and Change commands. Details of initialization are
    discussed below.

2.  The Find and Change commands must not change the state of the outline or body
    pane during execution. That would cause severe flashing and slow down the
    commands a great deal. In particular, the c.selectPosition and c.editPosition
    methods must not be called while looking for matches.

3.  When incremental Find or Change commands succeed they must leave the Leo
    window in the proper state to execute another incremental command. We
    restore the Leo window as it was on entry whenever an incremental search
    fails and after any Find All and Change All command. Initialization involves
    setting the self.c, self.v, self.in_headline, self.wrapping and
    self.s_text ivars.

Setting self.in_headline is tricky; we must be sure to retain the state of
the outline pane until initialization is complete. Initializing the Find All and
Change All commands is much easier because such initialization does not depend
on the state of the Leo window. Using Tk.Text widgets for both headlines and
body text results in a huge simplification of the code.

Indeed, the searching code does not know whether it is searching headline or
body text. The search code knows only that self.s_text is a Tk.Text widget that
contains the text to be searched or changed and the insert and sel Tk attributes
of self.search_text indicate the range of text to be searched. Searching
headline and body text simultaneously is complicated. The selectNextVnode()
method handles the many details involved by setting self.s_text and its insert
and sel attributes.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.267: *3* Tangle and untangle commands
This section describes Leo's explicit Tangle and Untangle commands. Such
commands operate only on @root and @unit trees. The previous chapter discusses
the implicit Tangle on Write/Untangle on Read processes used to read and write
@file trees.

The Tangle command translates the selected @root tree into one or more
well-formatted C source files. The outline should contain directives, sections
references and section definitions, as described in Chapter 4. The Untangle
command is essentially the reverse of the Tangle command. The Tangle command
creates a external file from an @root tree; the Untangle command incorporates
changes made to external files back into the @root tree.

The Tangle command operates in two passes. The first pass discovers the complete
definitions of all sections and places these definitions in a symbol table. The
first pass also makes a list of root sections. Definitions can appear in any
order, so we must scan the entire input file to know whether any particular
definition has been completed.

This second pass creates one file for each @root node. Tangle rescans each
section in the list of roots, copying the root text to the output and replacing
each section reference by the section's definition. This is a recursive process
because any definition may contain other references. We can not allow a section
to be defined in terms of itself, either directly or indirectly. We check for
such illegally recursive definitions in pass 2 using the section stack class.
Tangle indicates where sections begin and end using comment lines called
sentinel lines. The this part of the appendix discusses the format of the
sentinels output by the Tangle command.

The key design principle of the Tangle command is this::

    Tangle must output newlines in a context-free manner.

That is, Tangle must never output conditional newlines, either directly or
indirectly. Without this rule Untangle could not determine whether to skip or
copy newlines.

The Tangle command increases the indentation level of a section expansion the
minimum necessary to align the section expansion with the surrounding code. In
essence, this scheme aligns all section expansions with the line of code in
which the reference to the section occurs. In some cases, several nested
sections expansions will have the same indentation level. This can occur, for
example, when a section reference in an outline occurs at the left margin of the
outline.

This scheme is probably better than more obvious schemes that indent more
"consistently." Such schemes would produce too much indentation for deeply
nested outlines. The present scheme is clear enough and avoids indentation
wherever possible, yet indents sections adequately. End sentinel lines make this
scheme work by making clear where the expansion of one section ends and the
expansion of a containing section resumes.

Tangle increases indentation if the section reference does not start a line.
Untangle is aware of this hack and adjusts accordingly. This extra indentation
handles several common code idioms, which otherwise would create under-indented
code. In short, Tangle produces highly readable output, given the necessity
of preserving newlines for Untangle.

Untangle is inherently complex. It must do a perfect job of updating the
outline, especially whitespace, from expansions of section definitions created
by the Tangle command. Such expansions need not be identical because they may
have been generated at different levels of indentation. The Untangle command
can not assume that all expansions of a section will be identical in the derived
file; within the external file, the programmer may have made incompatible changes
to two different expansions of the same section. Untangle must check to see
that all expansions of a section are "equivalent". As an added complication,
external files do not contain all the information found in @root trees.
@root trees may contain headlines that generate no code at all. Also, an
outline may define a section in several ways: with an @c or @code
directive or with a section definition line. To be useful, Untangle must handle
all these complications flawlessly. The this part of the appendix discusses the
various conventions used in the sentinels output by the Tangle command.
These conventions allow the Untangle command to recreate whitespace
correctly.

Untangle operates in two passes. The first pass finds definitions in the
external file and enters them into the **Untangle Symbol Table**, or UST.
Definitions often include references to other sections, so definitions often
include nested definitions of referenced sections. The first pass uses a
definition stack to keep track of nested definitions. The top of the stack
represents the definition following the latest reference, except for the very
first entry pushed on the stack, which represents the code in the outline that
contains the @root directive. The stack never becomes empty because of the
entry for the @root section. All definitions of a section should
match--otherwise there is an inconsistent definition. This pass uses a forgiving
compare routine that ignores differences that do not affect the meaning of a
program.

The second pass of Untangle enters definitions from the outline into the
**Tangle Symbol Table**, or TST. The second pass simultaneously updates all
sections in the outline whose definition in the TST does not match the
definition in the UST. The central coding insight of the Untangle command is
this:  **the second pass of Untangle is almost identical to the first pass of
Tangle**. That is, Tangle and Untangle share key parts of code, namely the
skip_body method and its allies. Just when skip_body enters a definition
into the symbol table, all the information is present that Untangle needs to
update that definition.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.268: *3* Unicode
Leo uses unicode objects in vnodes and tnodes to denote headline and body text.
Note that unicode strings have no encoding; only plain strings have encodings.
This means that once an (encoded) plain string has been converted to a unicode
string it doesn't matter how the unicode string was created. This is the key
that makes Leo's new code robust: internally Leo never has to worry about
encodings. Encoding matter only when encoded strings are converted to and from
Unicode. This happens when Leo reads or writes files.

Python expressions that mix unicode strings u and plain strings s, like one of these::

	u + s
	u == s
	u[5] == s[2:]

are promoted to unicode objects using the "system encoding". This encoding
should never be changed, but we can't assume that we know what it is, so for
safety we should assume the most restrictive encoding, namely "ascii". With this
assumption, Leo's code can't throw an exception during these promotions provided
that: 

- All strings are converted to unicode when Leo reads files or gets text from Tk.Text widgets.

- All string literals in Leo's code have only ascii characters.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.269: *3* Unlimited undo
Unlimited undo is straightforward; it merely requires that all commands that
affect the outline or body text must be undoable. In other words, everything
that affects the outline or body text must be remembered. We may think of all
the actions that may be Undone or Redone as a string of beads (undo nodes).

Undoing an operation moves backwards to the next bead; redoing an operation moves
forwards to the next bead. A bead pointer points to the present bead. The bead
pointer points in front of the first bead when Undo is disabled. The bead
pointer points at the last bead when Redo is disabled. An undo node is a Python
dictionary containing all information needed to undo or redo the operation. The
Undo command uses the present bead to undo the action, then moves the bead
pointer backwards.

The Redo command uses the bead after the present bead to redo the action, then
moves the bead pointer forwards. All undoable operations call setUndoParams() to
create a new bead. The list of beads does not branch; all undoable operations
(except the Undo and Redo commands themselves) delete any beads following the
newly created bead. I did not invent this model of unlimited undo.
I first came across it in the documentation for Apple's Yellow Box classes.
.. @+node:ekr.20060602142732: *3* Key bindings


leoKeys.py handles key bindings.
There are two kinds of bindings, gui bindings and pane bindings.

**Gui bindings** are the actual binding as seen by Tkinter (or whatever gui is in effect).
Leo binds every key that has a binding to k.masterKeyHander.
For Tkinter, a *separate* binding must be made, rather than a single <Key> binding,
because, alas, Tkinter key events provide insufficient enough information
to tell what key actually caused the key event(!)
This is a significant hole in Tkinter's event mechanism.

At present Leo makes gui bindings in several places, all equivalent.
Bindings are made to callbacks, all of which have this form::

     def callback(event=None,k=k,stroke=stroke):
        return k.masterKeyHandler(event,stroke)

As a result, changing gui bindings actually has no effect whatever.
It would be clearer to have a single place to make these bindings...

In any case, the purpose of these callbacks is to capture the value of 'stroke' so
that it can be passed to k.masterKeyHandler.
This relieves k.masterKeyHandler of the impossible task of computing the stroke from the event.
**Important**:  No function argument is ever passed to k.masterKeyHandler from these callbacks,
because k.masterKeyHandler binds keys to command handlers as described next.

**Pane bindings** are bindings represented by various Python dictionaries in the keyHandlerClass
(see below).
k.masterKeyHandler and its helpers use these dictionaries to call the proper command or mode handler.
This logic is hairy, but it is completely separate from the gui binding logic.

Here are the dictionaries that k.masterKeyHandler uses:

- c.commandsDict:
  Keys are minibuffer command names; values are functions f.

- k.inverseCommandsDict:
  Keys are f.__name__l values are emacs command names.

- k.bindingsDict:
  Keys are shortcuts; values are *lists* of g.bunch(func,name,warningGiven).

- k.masterBindingsDict:
  Keys are pane names: 'all','text',etc. or mode names.
  Values are dicts:  keys are strokes; values are g.Bunch(commandName,func,pane,stroke).

- k.modeWidgetsDict:
  Keys are mode names; values are lists of widgets to which bindings have been made.

- k.settingsNameDict:
  Keys are lowercase settings; values are 'real' Tk key specifiers.
  Important: this table has no inverse.

- inverseBindingDict:
  This is *not* an ivar; it is computed by k.computeInverseBindingDict().
  Keys are emacs command names; values are *lists* of shortcuts.
