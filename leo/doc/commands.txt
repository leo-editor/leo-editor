Chapter 5: Using Leo's Commands
##########################################

This chapter discusses all of Leo's menu commands.
It starts with a discussion of the Emacs-like minibuffer,
then continues with a discussion of commands in each of Leo's menus.

.. @+node:ekr.20060227102028.111: *3* Autocompletion
Typing a period when @language python is in effect starts autocompletion. Typing
Return or Control-g (keyboard-quit) exits autocompletion.

Autocompletion shows what may follow a period in code. (Actually you can specify
any character using the auto-complete shortcut setting.) For example, after
typing g. Leo will show a list of all the global functions in leoGlobals.py.
Autocompletion works much like tab completion in the minibuffer. Unlike the
minibuffer, the presently selected completion appears directly in the body
pane.

A leading period brings up 'Autocomplete Modules'. (The period goes away.) You
can also get any module by typing its name. If more than 25 items would appear
in the Autocompleter tab, Leo shows only the valid starting characters. At this
point, typing an exclamation mark shows the complete list. Thereafter, typing
further exclamation marks toggles between full and abbreviated modes.

If x is a list 'x.!' shows all its elements, and if x is a Python dictionary,
'x.!' shows x.keys(). For example, 'sys.modules.!' Again, further exclamation
marks toggles between full and abbreviated modes.

During autocompletion, typing a question mark shows the docstring for the
object. For example: 'g.app?' shows the docstring for g.app. This doesn't work
(yet) directly for Python globals, but '__builtin__.f?' does. Example:
'__builtin__.pow?' shows the docstring for pow.

Autocompletion works in the Find tab; you can use <Tab> to cycle through the
choices. The 'Completion' tab appears while you are doing this; the Find tab
reappears once the completion is finished.
.. @+node:ekr.20100504092040.17423: *3* Calltips
Calltips appear after you type an open parenthesis in code. Calltips shows the
expected arguments to a function or method. Calltips work for any Python
function or method, including Python's global functions. Typing Return or
Control-g (keyboard-quit) exits calltips.

Examples:

a)  'g.toUnicode('  gives 'g.toUnicode(s, encoding, reportErrors=False'
b) 'c.widgetWantsFocusNow' gives 'c.widgetWantsFocusNow(w'
c) 'reduce(' gives 'reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -> value'

The calltips appear directly in the text and the argument list is highlighted so
you can just type to replace it. The calltips appear also in the status line for
reference after you have started to replace the args.

Options

Both autocompletion and calltips are initially enabled or disabled by the
enable_autocompleter and enable_calltips settings in leoSettings.leo. You may
enable or disable these features at any time with these commands:
enable-auto-completer-command, enable-calltips-command,
disable-auto-completer-command and disable-calltips-command.
.. @+node:ekr.20060420094611: *3* The minibuffer
The mini-buffer is a text area at the bottom of the body pane.
You use it like the Emacs mini-buffer to invoke commands by their so-called *long name*.
The following commands affect the minibuffer:

- **full-command**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Puts the focus in the minibuffer. Type a
  full command name, then hit <Return> to execute the command. Tab completion
  works, but not yet for file names.

.. - **quick-command-mode**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Like Emacs Control-C. This mode is
..   defined in leoSettings.leo. It is useful for commonly-used commands.

- **universal-argument**: (default shortcut: Alt-u) Like Emacs Ctrl-u. Adds a repeat
  count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's.

- **keyboard-quit**: (default shortcut: Ctrl-g) Exits any minibuffer mode and puts
  the focus in the body pane.

For example, to print a list of all commands type Alt-X print-commands <Return>.

The following sections list the various commands that you can invoke from the minibuffer.
**Important**: you may bind keystrokes to any of these commands.
See `Chapter 8: Customizing Leo`_ for full details.

.. @+node:ekr.20060613062025.2: *4* Help commands
The following commands print various helpful messages.
Apropos commands print longer discussions of specific topics.
The help-for-command command prompts for a command name
(you can use typing completion to specify the command)
and then prints a brief description of that command::

    apropos-autocompletion
    apropos-bindings
    apropos-find-commands
    help
    help-for-command
    mode-help
    print-bindings
    print-commands
    python-help
.. @+node:ekr.20060613062025.10: *4* Mode commands
These commands put Leo into various kinds of modes.

- The enter-x-mode commands enter modes defined by \@mode nodes in leoSettings.leo
  (or in other .leo files).

- The set-command-state, set-insert-state, set-overwrite-state commands
  determine how treats unbound plain keys. Leo ignores such keys in command
  state, inserts them into the body pane in insert state, and overwrites the
  character at the cursor position in overwrite state.

- Other commands determine whether autocompletion or calltips are in effect.

- When extend mode is effect, basic editing commands that move the cursor also
  extend the selected text.
  For example, in extend mode the back-char command works the same as the
  back-char-extend-selection command.

Here is the full list of mode-related commands::

    auto-complete
    auto-complete-force
    disable-autocompleter
    disable-calltips

.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.101: *4* Loading, Saving and Reverting Files
-   The New command creates a new Leo main window.

-   The Open command opens an existing Leo file and shows it in a main window.

-   The Close command closes the topmost Leo window,
    giving you an opportunity to save your work if you haven't yet done so.

-   The Save, Save As and Save To commands save the Leo window to a file.
    The Save As command changes the name of the outline being edited;
    the Save To command does not.

    The Save File As Zipped command is the same as the
    Save As command except that the resulting .leo file is compressed with Python's zipfile module.
    Similarly, the Save File As Unzipped command is the same as the Save As command
    except that the resulting .leo file is not compressed.
    The Save, Save As and Save To commands compress the file if it was originally compressed.
    **Note**: Leo writes files with .leo extension, regardless of whether the file is zipped or not.
    Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose name is the same as the .leo file itself.
    Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or other program to expand the .leo file
    contained within.

-   The Revert command reloads a file, discarding any changes made to the file since it was last saved.

-   The Recent Files command brings up a submenu containing a list of recently
    opened files. Choosing an item in this submenu opens the selected file or brings
    it to the front.

-   The Clear Recent Files command deletes all entries in the Recent
    Files submenu except the most recent file. The files themselves are not
    affected, just the menu entries.

The following commands are located in the Read/Write menu, part of the File
menu.

-   The Read Outline Only command reads an outline using only the .leo file, not any files derived
    from @file nodes. This command is useful for reverting a project to a
    previously saved state.

-   The Read @file Nodes command updates all @file nodes in an outline.
    This ensures that the state of an outline matches all files derived
    from @file nodes. 

-   The Write Outline Only command saves an outline without writing any @file
    trees. Useful for inserting an @file node into an outline without modifying a
    external file with the same name.

-   The Write @file Nodes command forces an update of all @file trees.

-   The Write Dirty @file Nodes command writes all @file trees that have been changed.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.102: *4* Communicating with external editors
The Open With command allows you to communicate with external editor. When
you select this command Leo creates a temporary file and invokes an external
program. Leo periodically checks whether this temporary file has changed; Leo
changes the corresponding node in the outline if so. You must create the entries
in the Open With submenu. This would typically be done in a hook routine, using
the createOpenWithMenuFromTable routine described in the child of this node. The
@file mod_open_with.py node in LeoPlugins.leo gives a complete example
of handling the Open With menu.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.105: *4* Tangling an outline: Producing external files
The Tangle, Tangle All and Tangle Marked commands create derived
files from portions of an outline. These commands indent and format the derived
files so that they are easy to read and so that it is clear what sections
produced the code. The .c file in the Examples folder shows the code produced by
the Tangle commands. The Tangle command tangles only the selected portion of
the outline, the Tangle All command tangles the entire outline, and the
Tangle Marked command tangles only marked headlines.

The Tangle commands create a external file, call it F, from each @root
node. This process is like macro expansion. The contents of F are simply the
body text of the @root node, with each section reference replaced by its
definition. Substitution continues until all references to sections are replaced
with their definitions. By default, Tangle commands look for section
definitions only in the suboutline containing the @root directive being
tangled. That is, all sections are assumed to be defined either in the body text
of the headline, say h, containing the
@root directive, or in the body texts of the descendants of h.
The @unit directive changes the default scope of the tangle command, while
the @ignore directive causes the tangle commands to ignore a subtree. For
more details, see: `Tangling @root trees with the Tangle commands`_
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.106: *4* Untangling: updating an outline
The Untangle, Untangle All and Untangle Marked commands are the
reverse of the corresponding Tangle commands. They update an outline based
on changes made to one or more external files. These are exceptionally useful
commands. For example, suppose you create a new part of the outline and
Tangle it for the first time. When you compile the resulting external files
for the first time, you are likely to get many syntax errors. You could fix
those errors in the outline and Tangle the outline again, but there is a much
easier way: you fix the errors in the external files using the compiler's editor,
then run the untangle command on the part of the outline that created the
external file. The Untangle command updates the selected outline to match the
changes in the external files. It's as simple as that. The Untangle command
marks all the nodes in the outline that it updates; you can examine all such
nodes with the Go To Next Marked command in the Outline menu. You cannot use
Untangle to update doc parts, or leading comments in code parts or "trivial"
whitespace in code parts. This is a limitation of the Untangle command that
cannot be fixed; Untangle has no way of knowing whether leading comments
came from doc parts or are just leading comments.

Untangle never changes the structure of an outline; it never inserts,
deletes or moves nodes. Don't attempt to change the structure of an outline by
modifying external files; it won't work. Also, never delete, move or alter the
sentinel lines in external files written by the Tangle command. Such lines start
with /// followed by a section name. If you change the section name in a
sentinel line Untangle will not update the code in the outline (with the old
name) that generated the renamed section. Untangle now warns about sections that
appear in a external file but not in the outline. Untangle has no trouble with
changed section references in external files; it is only changed sentinel lines
that cause problems. Cloned nodes that generate code in several files may cause
problems for Untangle if not all the code is changed the same way in derived
files. If Untangle is run separately on these external files, Untangle will
update all cloned nodes each time it is run, so only the code in the last
Untangle run will take effect. Therefore, the only reliable way to update
text in cloned nodes is to make the change in the .leo file rather than the
external files.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.108: *4* Importing Files into Leo Outlines
The Import commands do not attempt to do perfect translations; they merely automate the bulk of the drudgery:

-   The Import to @file command creates an @file node from a file.

-   The Import to @root command creates an @root node from a file.

-   The Import CWEB Files command creates an @file node from a `CWEB`_ file.

-   The Import noweb Files command creates an @file node from a `noweb`_ file.

-   The Import External File command imports all the nodes in a external file into the outline.
    Unlike the read commands, the command preserves no outline structure.

-   The Import Flattened Outline command converts plain text written in MORE format to an outline.

The Import Flattened Outline command brings up a dialog which will accept at
most one file. If that file contains MORE-format text it creates an outline
corresponding to that text. MORE is a now-defunct outliner program. MORE
represents outlines as follows. Headlines are denoted by a leading + or
- character, preceding by zero or more tabs that denote the level of the
headline. Body text follows its headline, with no indentation. The original
MORE format did not escape lines in the body text that started with + or -.
Leo escapes such characters by preceding +, - or backslash with a
backslash.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.109: *4* Exporting Files from Leo Outlines
-   The Outline To CWEB command creates a `CWEB`_ file from the selected outline.

-   The Outline TO noweb command creates a `noweb`_ file from the selected outline.

-   The Flatten Outline command creates a text file in MORE format from the selected outline.
    See the previous section for a discussion of MORE format.

-   The Remove Sentinels command removes all sentinel lines from a file derived from an @file node.

-   The Weave Command formats the selected text and writes it to a file.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.110: *4* Quitting Leo
The Quit command causes Leo to exit. You may also exit Leo by closing the
main window. You will be prompted to save any file that has been altered but not
saved.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.111: *3* The Edit Menu
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.112: *4* Undoing changes
Leo supports unlimited undo and redo. Think of actions that may be undone or
redone as a string of beads. A "bead pointer" points to the present bead.
Performing an operation creates a new bead after the present bead and removes
all following beads. Undoing an operation moves the bead pointer backwards;
redoing an operation moves the bead pointer forwards. The Undo command is
disabled when the bead pointer moves in front of the first bead; the Redo
command is disabled when the bead pointer points to the last bead.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.113: *4* Cutting, pasting and selecting text
Leo supports the standard editing commands: Cut, Copy, Paste,
Clear and Select All. These commands work with either headline or body
text.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.114: *4* Shifting body text
The Shift Left and Shift Right commands shift selected lines in the body
text left or right one tab position. These commands shift the entire line if any
characters in that line are selected.
.. @+node:ekr.20050313102319: *4* Adding and deleting comments in body text
-   The Add Comments command puts comments around a block of code.
    This command uses single-line comments if possible.

-   The Delete Comments command deletes the comments specified by the Add Comments command.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.115: *4* Creating nodes from body text
The Extract, Extract Section and Extract Section Names commands create child nodes whose headline is the first line of the selected body text.

-   The Extract command creates a new node whose headline is the first line of selected body text and
    whose body is all other lines of selected text.
    Previously selected text is deleted from the original body text. 

-   The Extract Section command creates a new node whose headline is the first line of selected text and
    whose body is @code followed by all the other lines of selected text.
    All selected text lines except the first line are deleted from the original body text.
    This command is enabled only if the first line contains nothing but section name.

-   The Extract Section Names command creates one or more child nodes,
    one for each section name in the selected body text.
    The headline of each created node is the section name; the body text is @code followed by a newline.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.116: *4* Converting leading blanks and tabs in body text
-   The Convert Tabs command converts leading tabs to blanks in a single node.
-   The Convert Blanks command converts blanks to tabs in a single node.
-   The Convert All Tabs converts leading tabs to blanks throughout the selected tree.
-   The Convert All Blanks command converts leading blanks to tabs throughout the selected tree.

All these commands convert between tabs and blanks using the tab width presently in effect.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.117: *4* Executing Python scripts in body text
The Execute Script command executes body text as a Python script. Leo
execute the selected text, or the entire body text if no text is selected. The
Execute Script command pre-defines the values c, g and p as
follows:

- c is the commander of the outline containing the script.
- g is the leoGlobals modules.
- p is c.p, that is, c.currentPosition().

**Important**: Body text may contain Leo directives and section references. You
can now use all of Leo's features to organize scripts that you execute
interactively. Section definitions must appear in the node containing the script
or in descendant nodes.

Leo preprocesses all scripts by simulating the writing of a external file to a
string. The Execute Script command sets app.scriptDict["script1"] to the
value of the script before preprocessing, and sets app.scriptDict["script2"]
to the value of the script after preprocessing. Scripts may examine and change
app.scriptDict as they please.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.118: *4* Finding and changing text
The following check boxes options appear in the search dialog and control the operations of the find and change commands.

Clone Find All
    When checked, the the Find All command creates a new root node called Found: *<your search pattern>*.
    This node contains clones of the nodes found by the Find All command.
    It is your responsibility to navigate to this new node and to clean it up when it's no longer needed.

Ignore Case
    When checked, the Find and Change commands ignore the case of alphabetic characters when determining matches.

Mark Changes
    When checked, the Change command marks all headlines whose headline or body text are changed by the command.

Mark Matches
    When checked, the Find and Change commands mark all headlines in which a match is found with the pattern.

Pattern Match
    When checked, the Find and Change commands treat several characters specially in the find pattern.

    - '*'  matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
    - '.'  matches any single character.
    - '^'  matches a newline at the start of a pattern.
    - '$'  matches a newline at the end of a pattern.

Examples::

    "^abc$" matches lines that only contain "abc".
    "^a" matches any line starting with "A".
    "a$" matches any line ending with "a".
    "^*$" matches any line at all.

Reverse
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search backward through the file.

Search Body Text
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search body text.

Search Headline Text
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search headline text.

Show Context
    When checked, the Find All command shows additional context information when printing matches.

Suboutline Only
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search only the currently selected headline and its offspring.

Whole Word
    When checked, the find pattern must match an entire word.
    Words consist of an alphabetic character or underscore, followed by zero or more
    alphabetic characters, numbers or underscores.

Wrap Around
    When checked, the Find and Change commands continues at the top of the file when
    the command reaches the bottom of the file.
    For reverse searches, the find or change command continues at the bottom of the file when
    the command reaches the top of the file.
.. @+node:ekr.20050902160924: *4* Script search
**Important**: Script buttons are easier to use than the script-oriented
find/change commands described next. I recommend using script buttons whenever
possible. See `Creating script buttons`_.
You are not likely to need all the firepower that script-orient find/change commands,
but it could save you lots of time for complex jobs.

Leo's find panel contains the Script Search radio button and the Script
Change checkbox. When the Script Search radio button is selected Leo treats the
contents of the Search Text as a script to execute whenever any kind of Find
command is executed. Similarly, when the Script Change checkbox is selected Leo
treats the context of the Change Text as a script to execute whenever any kind
of Change command is executed.

Script-based find-change turns Leo's Find/Change panel into a platform for
running scripts interactively. The script writer need not write code to control
interactive searches.

Here's how it works. Leo dedicates g.app.searchDict for
communication between Leo and the search and change scripts. The search and
change scripts may also use g.app.searchDict for communication between themselves.
Leo sets g.app.searchDict["type"] to "find", "change", "findAll" or "changeAll" to
indicate the kind of command being executed. Scripts may use all other entries
in g.app.searchDict as they please.

Here is what Leo does when the user presses buttons with Script Search enable:

Find and Change, then Find buttons
    Leo executes the find script once. Typically, the find script would traverse
    the tree and highlight the found text or otherwise indicate to the user that
    the find operation has succeeded. However, the script can do anything it
    pleases.

Find All button
    Leo executes the find script repeatedly until g.app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates
    to False. Initially there is no entry for g.app.searchDict["continue"], so the
    find script must set g.app.searchDict["continue"] = True if it wants Leo call it again.

Change button
    Leo executes the change script once. Typically, the change script would change
    the selected text. Usually the change script will compute the new value of body
    text and call c.setBodyString(p,newText) to make that change permanent. 
    To handle undo, the change script can call
    c.frame.onBodyChanged(v,"Change",oldText=oldText).

Change All button
    Leo executes the change script repeatedly
    until g.app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates to false.

Most find and change scripts will ignore settings in the Find Panel like "whole
word", "pattern match", and "reverse". However, these settings are available to
the scripts via ivars such as c.whole_word_flag, etc. if desired.

The initScriptFind script in LeoPy.leo makes it easy to set up script based searches:

1. Put the following code in the root of a tree that will contain your script search::

    # Initialize Leo's find panel using the named children of this node.
    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g.
    g.initScriptFind("Find script","Change script") # Second argument is optional.
    # Start searching at the top.
    c.selectPosition(c.rootPosition())

2. Put the search script in a child node called "Find script" (no quotes).

3. (Optional) Put the change script in a child node called "Change script"

4.  Execute the code above.  Leo does the following:

- Puts the body of the "Find script" into the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Puts the body of the "Change script" into the change text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Selects the Script Find radio button.
- Selects the Script Change checkbox if the change script exists.
- Selects the root of the entire outline.

Presto! Leo is ready for a script search. **Note**: you could also consider creating a
script button to set up complex find/change scripts.

Here are some ideas for using script find/change.

-   Find and change scripts may use Python's re module.  For
    example, the find script could set g.app.searchDict["m"] to the match object
    returned by re's match method.  The change script would then compute the
    result, change the text and set the undo info as usual.

-   Find and change scripts may operate on data outside any Leo outline.
    For example, script-find scripts could traverse your file system.
    Scripts could even pull data from the file system
    into the outline so that you can see the effects of changes as the scripts
    operate.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.134: *4* Go To Line Number
The Go To Line Number command selects the locations in your outlines corresponding to a line in a external file.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.136: *4* Inserting the date and time
The Insert Body Time/Date and Insert Headline Time/Date commands insert
formatted time and date into body or headline text. You must be editing a
headline to be able to insert the time/date into the headline.
The  body_time_format_string and headline_time_format_string settings
specify the format of the inserted text. These settings are the format string
passed to time.strftime. For a complete list of the format options see
http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html
If the format specified by either of these two settings is erroneous the
"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S" format is used by default, resulting in a time/date
format like::

    1/30/2003 8:31:55
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.137: *4* Reformatting paragraphs in body text
The Reformat Paragraph command rearranges the words in a text paragraph to fill
each line as full as possible, up to the @pagewidth setting. A paragraph is
delimited by blank lines, Leo directives, and (of course) start and end of text
in a node. The width of the line used by the reformatting operation is governed
by @pagewidth and the indentation that would be applied to the node when
tangled (as part of a @root) or written (as part of a @file).

The command operates on the paragraph containing the insert cursor. If the
insert cursor is on a blank line or directive, nothing happens. If the cursor is
on a line containing text, then the paragraph containing that text line is
reformatted and the insert cursor is moved to the next paragraph.

**Note**: Hanging indentation is preserved. This is most useful for bulleted or
numbered lists, such as::

  1. This is the first paragraph,
     and it has a hanging indentation.

  2. This is the second paragraph,
     and it too has a hanging indentation.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.139: *4* Matching brackets and parenthesis
The Match Brackets command is enabled if the cursor is next to one of the
following characters in the body pane:

    ( ) [ ] { } < >

This command looks for the matching character, searching backwards through the
body text if the cursor is next to `)` `]` `}` or `>` and searching forward through the
text otherwise. If the cursor is between two brackets the search is made for the
bracket matching the leftmost bracket. If a match is found, the entire range of
characters delimited by the brackets is highlighted and the cursor is placed
just to the left of the matching characters. Thus, executing this command twice
highlights the range of matched characters without changing the cursor.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.143: *3* The Outline Menu
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.144: *4*  Checking outlines
-   The Check Outline command checks the outline for consistency.

-   The Check All Python Code and Check Python Code commands report any syntax errors or tabnanny errors.
    These commands mark erroneous nodes and ignore any nodes for which:

        - @ignore is in effect or
        - @language python is in not effect.

-   The Check Python Code and Pretty Print Python Code pretty print body text.
    You can customize this code by overriding the following methods of class prettyPrinter in leoCommands.py::

        putOperator:      puts whitespace around operators.
        putNormalToken:   puts whitespace around everything else.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.145: *4*  Creating & cloning nodes
-   The Insert Headline command inserts a new headline after the presently selected headline,
    either as the next sibling or the first child of the presently selected headline
    if the presently selected headline has children and is expanded.

-   The Clone Node creates a clone of the selected node.
    See `Clones and views`_ for full details about clones.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.146: *4*  Cutting, pasting and deleting nodes
-   The Cut Outline and Copy Outline commands copy a text
    representation of the outline to the clipboard. This representation is the same
    as the file format with some information deleted.

-   The Paste command (in the Edit menu) copies this representation into the *body* pane.

-   The Paste Node As Clone command pastes the node from the clipboard, retaining the
    identity of nodes.  Thus, if the pasted node already exists in the outline the newly
    pasted node will become of a clone of the already-existing node.

-   The Paste Outline command creates nodes with new identities (new gnx's).
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.147: *4*  Expanding and contracting nodes
-   The Expand command expands the currently selected node so that all its children are visible.
-   The Expand All Subheads command expands the currently selected node so that all its offspring are visible.
-   The Expand All command expands all the nodes of the entire tree.
-   The Contract Parent contracts the selected node's parent and selects the parent node.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.149: *4*  Marking nodes
-   The Mark Headline command marks a headline with a red marker  near the leader characters.
-   The Unmark Headline command removes such a mark.
-   The Mark Subheads command marks all offspring of the currently selected node.
-   The Unmark All command removes the marks from the entire tree.
-   The Mark Changed Items command marks all headlines whose headline or
    body text has been changed since the file was last saved.
-   The Mark Changed Roots command marks all changed headlines whose body text contains the @root directive.
    This command is especially useful with the Tangle Marked command.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.150: *4*  Moving, sorting and reorganizing nodes
-   The Move Up, Move Down, Move Left and Move Right commands move the currently selected node.

-   The Promote command makes all the children of a node siblings of the node.

-   The Demote command makes all the siblings that follow a node children of the node.

-   The Sort Children command sorts all children of the present node in alphabetical order of their headlines.

-   The Sort Siblings command sorts all siblings of the present node in alphabetical order.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.148: *4*  Hoisting & De-hoisting nodes
-   The Hoist command redraws the screen so presently selected tree becomes the only visible part of the outline.
    Hoist commands may be nested.  

-   The De-hoist command restores the outline.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.151: *3* The Window Menu
-   The Equal Sized Panes command adjusts the sizes of the outline and body
    panes so that they are the same height.
-   The Cascade command cleans up the screen by cascading all Leo windows.
-   The Minimize All command minimizes all Leo windows.
-   The Toggle Active Pane command toggles keyboard focus between the outline and body panes.
-   The Toggle Split Direction command switches between vertical and horizontal
    orientations of the Leo window. In the vertical orientation, the body pane
    appears below the pane containing the outline and log panes. In the horizontal
    orientation, the body pane appears to the left the pane containing the outline
    and log panes. By default, the ratio of pane outline pane to the body pane is
    0.5 in the vertical orientation and 0.3 in the horizontal orientation. These two
    ratios may be changed using settings.
-   The Open Compare Window command opens a dialog that allows you to compare
    two files, one containing sentinels and one not.
.. @+node:EKR.20040524104904.157: *3* The Help Menu
-   The About Leo command puts up a dialog box showing the version of Leo.
-   The Online Home Page command opens Leo's home page at http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html.
-   The Open Online Tutorial command opens Joe Orr's excellent ScreenBook tutorial at
    http://www.evisa.com/e/sbooks/leo/sbframetoc_ie.htm.
-   The Open Offline Tutorial command opens the file sbooks.chm if it exists.
    Otherwise, you will be asked whether you want to download it from Leo's SourceForge web site.
    If you say yes, the page http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458 will open.
    You may then download sbooks.sbm to the folder containing leo.py.
-   The Open LeoDocs.leo command opens LeoDocs.leo.
