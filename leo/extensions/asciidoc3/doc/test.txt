The german umlauts and two other non-ascii glyphs / letters: äöüÄÖÜß € (euro) ¢ (cent). 

== Second Paragraph
This sample comes with an image. The file name paths are relative to the location of the referring document:
image:redsquare.jpg[caption]
The "caption" in brackets corresponds to HTML alt="caption" and is not seen in the browser. The image is rendered inline; this is perhaps not preferred footnote:[or is it?], we have a footnote here.

Another snippet:

image:redsquare.jpg[caption]


and the image at the center of the line.

New line and the image at the beginningfootnote:[footnote without space] of the line.

New line:

image::redsquare.jpg["caption",align="center"]
