                            Bugs and Known Problems

   AsciiDoc3 Version 3.1.0, 12 April 2019
   __________________________________________________________________

1. AsciiDoc3

     * Reported line numbers in diagnostic messages are sometimes wrong.
     * Attribute references in macro attribute lists can’t be unescaped
       (with the exception of attribute list entry {0}).
     * Section numbering is incorrect when outputting HTML from a
       multi-part book type document. This is not a biggy since multi-part
       books are generally processed to DocBook.
     * A row of apostrophes in an inline context throws AsciiDoc3 into an
       endless loop. The problem seems to be in the input file Reader.
       (workaround: begin the line with a space or \)
