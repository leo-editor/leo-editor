# This part of the tree shows views of the outline related to specific 
# projects or tasks.  I put such headlines in parentheses, and that is just my 
# convention.
# 
# I create a new view by cloning headlines that relate to its task, and moving 
# the cloned headlines under the task headline.  This greatly increases my 
# focus.  Any changes made in a task view to clone headlines affect the other 
# clones scattered throughout the outline.  In particular, all @file nodes 
# containing changed clones become marked as dirty, so they will be written 
# when the entire outline is saved.

E0100:	__init__ method is a generator Used when the special class method __init__ is turned into a generator by a yield in its body.
E0101:	Explicit return in __init__ Used when the special class method __init__ has an explicit return value.
E0102:	%s already defined line %s Used when a function / class / method is redefined.
E0103:	%r not properly in loop Used when break or continue keywords are used outside a loop.
E0104:	return outside function Used when a "return" statement is found outside a function or method.
E0105:	yield outside function Used when a "yield" statement is found outside a function or method.
E0106:	return with argument inside generator Used when a "return" statement with an argument is found outside in a generator function or method (e.g. with some "yield" statements).

W0101:	Unreachable code Used when there is some code behind a "return" or "raise" statement, which will never be accessed.
W0102:	Dangerous default value %s as argument Used when a mutable value as list or dictionary is detected in a default value for an argument.
W0104:	Statement seems to have no effect Used when a statement doesn't have (or at least seems to) any effect.
W0105:	String statement has no effect Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect). This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of comments.
W0106:	Unnecessary semicolon Used when a statement is endend by a semi-colon (";"), which isn't necessary (that's python, not C ;).
W0107:	Unnecessary pass statement Used when a "pass" statement that can be avoided is encountered.)
W0122:	Use of the exec statement Used when you use the "exec" statement, to discourage its usage. That doesn't mean you can not use it !
W0141:	Used builtin function %r Used when a black listed builtin function is used (see the bad-function option). Usual black listed functions are the ones like map, or filter , where Python offers now some cleaner alternative like list comprehension.
W0142:	Used * or * magic* Used when a function or method is called using *args or **kwargs to dispatch arguments. This doesn't improve readility and should be used with care.

C0102:	Black listed name "%s" Used when the name is listed in the black list (unauthorized names).
C0103:	Invalid name "%s" (should match %s) Used when the name doesn't match the regular expression associated to its type (constant, variable, class...).
C0111:	Missing docstring Used when a module, function, class or method has no docstring. Some special methods like __init__ doesn't necessary require a docstring.
C0112:	Empty docstring Used when a module, function, class or method has an empty docstring (it would be too easy ;).

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4668960
By: terry_n_brown

It seems in derived files you can delete some text and save, causing the derived
file to be written and all dirty flags cleared.  But then undo makes the text
come back, as expected, but save only saves the outline, because the dirty flag
wasn't set on the node in which the text was restored by undo.

By: drtimcouper

Using v 4.4.5, I've tried to follow the programming tutorial to read in a python
file. File-Import to @file, select the file and I get a node

@nosent C:\..\.. .py

which is close, except I was expecting an @file, like the tutorial says, and
not an @nosent. The @nosent then has greyed-out Extract Section, so I'm stuck,
and can't create sections (well, I can add a <<section>> and Extract it, but
cannot see a way to refresh the code when I make changes externally to the file.

The same happens with a .java file too, FWIW.

By: kayvan

I see that default.css is there (and it is there in my workspace).

The intent of that code seems to be to find the default.css in the same directory
as the leo file if it exists there. However, it does not look like it's working.

If I chdir to the doc/ directory before I start leo, everything works as
expected.

There has to be a way for us to get the rst3 plugin to see the default.css (in
the same directory as the LEO file that is being processed) when rst3_stylesheet_path
is not set.

This was a very long-standing bug: the most annoying in all of Leo.

The problem was an extra call to findNextCommand in generalChangeHelper (!)

I added much better tracing code in the base leoFind class,
controled by the trace ivar.

New in 4.3:
- These are the names of leoFind ivars. (no more _flag hack).
- There are no corresponding commander ivars to keep in synch (hurray!)
- These ivars are inited (in the subclass by init) when this class is created.
- These ivars are updated by update_ivars just before doing any find.

#@+node:ekr.20071210054816:Applied Terry Brown's config patch
@nocolor
The patch attached against leoConfig.py (current CVS) adds a machine
specific config file to the config files Leo loads.

I synchronize files between multiple (3) machines. This means I can't
use different myLeoSettings files on each.

Tk fonts are screen dpi sensitive.  But (in Linux at least)
Tk's attempts to switch a font you picked to something equivalent at a
different dpi always result in a font that looks terrible.

So every time I switch machines I edit ~/myLeoSettings.leo to move the
font defs I picked for the current machine to the bottom of the body
text for the appropriate settings node, and then restart Leo.

This patch means I don't have to do that any more.  I'm sure there are
other uses for it.  Python doesn't seem to have a generic machine name
finding function, hence the sequence of alternatives.

Cheers -Terry

The version of plugins_menu.py at http://leo.zwiki.org/Plumloco separates out
the gui dependent dialogs (the menus are already gui indepandant) and made them
general purpose dialogs available to all plugins.

I have also slightly enhanced the dialogs to provide user defined buttons.

As far as I am aware, this is the definitive specification for javascript. 

http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf  

The most relavent part is below. This has caused much aggrevation to many
people. Regexp's which parse for regexp literals in javascript, usually check
for '/' after chars which can not be followed by a div, eg (,[{ etc. I think a
regexp literal can occur almost anywhere a string literal can apart from this
restriction.

-- quote --

The source text of an ECMAScript program is first converted into a sequence of
input elements, which are either tokens, line terminators, comments, or white
space. The source text is scanned from left to right, repeatedly taking the
longest possible sequence of characters as the next input element.

There are two goal symbols for the lexical grammar. The InputElementDiv symbol
is used in those syntactic grammar contexts where a division (/) or
division-assignment (/=) operator is permitted. The InputElementRegExp symbol is
used in other syntactic grammar contexts.

Note that contexts exist in the syntactic grammar where both a division and a
RegularExpressionLiteral are permitted by the syntactic grammar; however, since
the lexical grammar uses the InputElementDiv goal symbol in such cases, the
opening slash is not recognised as starting a regular expression literal in such
a context. As a workaround, one may enclose the regular expression literal in p.

In nav_buttons plugin when showing the recentSectionsDialog, delete and clearall
result in tk error dialogs.

The fix is to ...

change line 323 to: c.nodeHistory.clear()
change line 351 to: p = self.positionList[n]

It seems the colorization dies shortly into each node. So the first .. comment
might be colored, or the first part of an `interpreted` word, but then it gives
up.

What I did:

- There was a horrendous bug in the match_seq_regexp matcher which could cause the colorizer to loop.
- There was another horrendous bug in match_regexp_helper that cause spurious matches.
- Added some more defensive code to have the colorizer recover more gracefully in this case. 
- The jedit2py script was not associating regexp rules whose regex starts with
  '\' with the proper character. The proper character is the hash_char
  character, not the '\' character. As a result, regexp's that start with '\'
  never got matched.

The following colorizers are affected by the change:

modes/apacheconf.py
modes/erlang.py
modes/moin.py
modes/perl.py
modes/php.py
modes/pl1.py
modes/rest.py

Another problem : When we work on a .leo file in different computers, in different
languages (I use US English Windows on one machine and Portuguese on another),
user icons will not work. I was not seeing any icons in the Portuguese Windows
computer.

On the US English Windows, Leo is installed in "C:\Program Files\Leo".
On the Portuguese Windows, Leo is installed in "C:\Programas\Leo".

But Leo is always assuming that the user library location is "C:\Program
Files\Leo\Icons".

I would love to see a more polished version of icon handling where you can easily
add icons as part of scripts and not only by selecting menu items. At the moment,
I am not really getting how to untangle the file selection dialog from the insertion
of the icon into the headline.

I think I've found a little bug in Leo.

It can be reproduce as follow :
- Create a leo file, containing file @file node (anything you want).
- Create a content for this @file node
- Save, to record the leo file, and to tangle the target file
- Modify something in the @file node content
- Save again : the leo file is recorded and the target file is retangled (Ok)
- Now, do a Ctrl-Z (undo command)
- Save : the leo file is recorded (Ok) but the target file is not retangled
(the lack)

I've narrowed the Perl errors down to an incredibly small Perl function --- I tried to debug myself, but couldn't immediately find where this was hanging up (or where to set reasonable breakpoints).

Attached is the Perl errant file with the perl.

To see the problem:

    * open the leo file;
    * select node "APerlProblem"=>foo
    * note @language text
    * select node "APerlProblem"=>foo=>problem.pl
    * Note no colorization
    * in "A Perl Problem"=>foo  change @language text to @language perl
    * note: you can save the Leo file fine;  you can also navigate to the boy of "just text" node
    * navigate to the body of node  APerlProblem=>foo=>ok.pl - it is colorized, and "ok".
    * NOTE: when you navigate to problem.pl node, Leo hangs

I added the OK.pl node just to convince myself - it hangs with just the "problem.pl" node just as well.

I had a node which looked like this:

    import sys

I wanted to add an @language python directive, so I positioned the
cursor in front of the "i" and started typing.  I typed "@language "
and was left with this:

    @language import sys

It complained about not being able to import "import".  Next I typed
"p", leaving

    @language pimport sys

It complained again, this time about "pimport".  It seems to me that
Leo ought to sit back and watch the typing without complaint until I
type a character not in the acceptible set for the @language directive
(typically a SPC, RET or punctuation).  I can see that it seems to
only make the same complaint once (type "p", get a complaint about
"pimport", delete "p", type "p" again, no complaint this time), but
just like an interactive spell checker waits until the user thinks
he's typed a word, maybe Leo should wait as well.

#@+node:ekr.20080208104232:Renamed execute-ipython-script to push-to-ipython
@nocolor

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/a75924f3f0d6ce9a

- rename 'execute-ipython-script' to 'push-to-ipython'

Rationale: I see this as a general command that requests leo to
interact with ipython for current node. The default functionality
would of course be to execute the script, but there will be
context-sensitive functionality later on.

For example, If a node had the text

@ipy-eval foo

... some stuff
@ipy-eval

This would evaluate 'foo' in IPython and fill the node (from the line
'@ipy-eval foo' downwards, up to @ipy-eval, replacing '... some
stuff') with the result of the evaluation of foo.

- instead of the current pre-created @ipython-results, this would be more handy:

Headline @ipy-var foo

would mean the contents of ipython variable foo.

When we do

leox.results.foo = "hello"

We would just scan the tree for @ipy-var foo, and then fill up that
node. If such a node is not found, just create it as the last child of
the root node. That way, we don't need any pre-created nodes in the
tree. Of course 'results' is a misnomer then...

What I did:

- Added  .blockCommentDelim1_2 and .blockCommentDelim2_2 and associated logic
  to handle { and } as well as (* and *) as comment delims.

- Added .anonymousClasses ivar to base class.

- Added .blockDelim2Cruft ivar to base class, and associated code in skipBlock.

- Added all the new overrides to the pascalScanner class.
  These are needed to handle Delphi interface declarations.

- Hacked startsHelper in the base class to handle some new special cases.

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4731971

I've just started dabbling w/ Django, and so I tried to bring up one "you figure
it out" app, so naturally thought to pull it into Leo...

Importing works (e.g. the app still works at the bringup stage). 

However, one of the dependent plugins has a test file which causes Leo heartburn. 

tests.py - is file which is essentially just one long docstring.  
Importing creates a "tests settings" node. 
I change the @file node above it to a @thin node. 
On writing, Leo errors out and writes the node in question internally. 

This is from http://django-tagging.googlecode.com/svn/trunk (or zip on http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/) 

Copying the created child node up into the "@thin tests/tests.py" gets rid of the problem. 

Let me know if you want more info (the error is essentially the length of a long
docstring, so not sure if it's useful out of context).

#@+node:ekr.20080212042248:What I did
@nocolor

Cvs now contains code to handle encodings properly for @auto files:

When reading an @auto tree, createOutline now does the following:

1. When importing Python files, createOutline uses the encoding implied by
Python's # -*- coding line. This line must be the first line of the imported file.

2. Otherwise, createOutline scans the @auto node and its ancestors for Leo's @encoding directive.

3. If no such @encoding directive is found, createOutline uses the encoding specified by the setting: @string default_at_auto_file_encoding = utf-8

4. If this setting does not exist, the utf-8 encoding is used.

I am running Leo 4.4.6 on Ubuntu Linux (Gutsy and Hardy). Upon
application startup, error was occurring on loading "image plugin".

It turns out that the version of PIL that ships with Ubuntu (and
presumably Debian and maybe some other distributions) no longer
includes the ImageTk module. ImageTk is now located in the python-
imaging-tk package.

After installing the proper PIL, it is also necessary to change the
plugin module, "[usr/local/lib/] leo/plugins/image.py".

Near the start of the program, change the line:
"import ImageTk"
to
"from PIL import ImageTk"

As things are in flux vcs wise I'll use the handy `edream` vcs system
for this patch ;-)

If you're using the xemacs plugin it's nice not to have to save the Leo
outline to get changes made in emacs to propagate to the file system.
I.e. as well as ctrl-x-s in emacs you have to switch to the leo window
and ctrl-s there to actually write the file.  This patch optionally
removes that second step.

Cheers -Terry

@nocolor

Eureka! I have just discovered an elegant solution to this problem!

The Aha is this:  we can create a "base" timestamp just *once*, when
the commander (i.e. the nodeIndices class) is created.  Thereafter,
code that writes gnx's simply calls nodeIndices.getIndex if the node
doesn't already have an index (or if indices are being reassigned in a
copied tree).

In other words, there is no need to be picky about timestamps, the
base timestamp will do, so there is no need to assign indices before
writing nodes!

I didn't see this before because computing timestamps is quite time
consuming.  In fact, we can't do so "on the fly".  That being so, the
old code computed the "new" timestamp once in assignFileIndices, which
lead me away from getting gnx's as needed.  But if there is only *one*
timestamp everything becomes easy.  There is no need to "batch" the
computation of gnx's.  In other words, timestamps don't have to be up-
to-the-second accurate.  They simply guarantee that two nodes (in a
particular outline) created by the *same* person can't collide.

This is the way it is written in "The Book". All calls to
assignFileIndices disappear!  All the code I wrote this morning that
remembers whether indices have been assigned disappears.  I'll keep a
do-nothing assignFileIndices around for compatibility with old
scripts.

This is *so* important.  It eliminates forever a source of serious
file write problems.  Furthermore, nodeIndices.getIndex becomes
substantially simpler. Even though the code was short, it implied some
very tricky assumptions.  Every time I read it I had to recreate why
it worked.  Those mental gymnastics should disappear.

A great day for Leo.

@nocolor

http://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox/1184b70ea10f5aa3

Leo now contains minimal support for arguments to minibuffer commands.

- k.simulateCommand now puts arguments following the command name in k.givenArgs.
  Whitespace separates arguments.

- k.simulateCommand knows nothing about what the arguments mean. That is up to
  the individual commands.

- At present, only the following minibuffer commands now support k.givenArgs:
  open-outline, open-outline-by-name, save-file, save-file-as,
  save-file-as-unzipped and save-file-as-zipped.

  These commands use ''.join(k.givenArgs) to get the file name,
  which may cause problems if the file name contains whitespace.

- At present, the repeat-complex-command command does not support arguments.

@nocolor


- g.translateString does the actual translation.

- g.es and g.es_print now support exactly the same arguments.

  The methods translate only the first, third, etc arguments.
  Keyword arguments, color & newline, etc. are never translated.

'''Here is a cute Leo script. It discovers all g.es statements and the unbound
variables in those statements in a single pass over the selected outline. It
then puts the decls followed by the statements in the body text of the @scan_g.es_results node.

Thus, after this script, you can **execute** the body text of the @scan_g.es_results node.
In particular, assuming that g.translateString converts all translated text to upper case,
it is easy to tell which strings have been translated.

@

2008/2/19 EKR: Initial 2-pass version.
2008/2/20 EKR:
- Convert to single-pass using decls and statements arrays.
- Add 'tabName' to list of keyword arguments.
- Fixed various bugs.
2008/2/20 EKR 2:
- Generate g.es statements to inicate beginnings of files.
  This allows us to execute all generated statements at once.
- Convert between '.' and '__' as needed to avoid using real ivars.
2008/2/21 EKR:
- Added mungeString.
- Rewrote mungeStatements, scanParens and scanIdChain.
These changes now properly handle all arguments.
2008/2/21 EKR 2:
- Added stringize and related logic.
- Added setToBeTranslated to put list of to-be-translated strings into leading docstring.

#@+node:ekr.20071217032247:Compile regexp's once in findNextMatch

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4677335

The regexHelper method does compile regexp's before searching for them.  Alas, this method is called once per searched node, which greatly increases the compilation overhead.  Presumably it would be much better to compile the regexp once, say in findNextMatch.
