This revision does the following:

* Implements a new option "Leo-Babel-Sudo" to run the script using sudo.  The default setting for this option is off.

* Implements a new option "Leo-Babel-Tab-Babel" to use a "Babel" tab in the Log pane for all Leo-Babel output.

* Implements line prefix options to indicate the type of each line in the "Babel" tab of the Log pane.

* Implements a new option "Leo-Babel-Poll-Delay" to specify the output polling delay in milliseconds.  Previously the delay was 1000.  Now the default is 1.

* Inserts a shebang line as the first line in every script file.  This isn't needed by Leo-Babel which specifies the interpreter for the script file, but it allows the user to safely run the script without specifying the interpreter.

* Changes the default color for "Leo-Babel-stdout"

* Changes the default color for "Leo-Babel-stderr"

#@+node:bob.20170319141959.1: *3* uA's
I don't understand Terry Brown's attrib_edit.py plugin.  I think it is inadequate anyway.

I might look at it for help coding a Babel specific editing facility.

Jacob Peck's nodetags.py may be useful for classifying nodes into possibly overlapping sets, but I doubt that Babel can use it.
I have never felt a need for tags--unless I could have used them in my application lists.  A tag for each OS under which an application runs would have allowed me to list the applications in strictly alphabetical order.

Peck's UI seems good to me.  I think it includes everything you need.

----
Babel's uA's:

p.v.u['Babel'] = dictionary whose keys and values are strings.
    The keys are the Babel parameter names:
        Key                         Value
        src                         Language name.  Examples:  bash, python
                Currently EKR favors using @language directives for this.
        output                      "function", "stdout", "stderr", "stdout-stderr", "stdout->stderr"
        session                     Session name
        name                        Name of block ???? -- i.e. function name
        variable                    Name of function variable ??? There may be many variables

How would this be implemented as a bash function?
How is session implemented?

#@+node:bob.20170320163045.1: *3* Sessions
For a session start an interpreter (Python or BASH) taking its input from stdin.
Then feed the interpreter code as it becomes available.
Terminate the session with a Ctrl-D (or EOF) to stdin.


Problem:  If the interpreter doesn't terminate after processing a batch of code, how do I tell that the interpreter has finished and is idle?

Possible solution:  Send the interpreter a command that causes it to output a magic number to stdout when it finishes the batch of code.

So the Leo-Editor processes started by Thunar are not associated with any terminal.

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-bash-s-job-control-to-manage-foreground-and-background-processes

Linux terminals are usually configured to send the "SIGINT" signal (typically signal number 2) to current foreground process when the CTRL-C key combination is pressed. The SIGINT signal tells the program that the user has requested termination using the keyboard.

What is the crucial difference between starting a program from a terminal and starting it from Thunar?

CTRL+C and CTRL+BREAK Signals

The CTRL+C and CTRL+BREAK key combinations receive special handling by console processes. By default, when a console window has the keyboard focus, CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK is treated as a signal (SIGINT or SIGBREAK) and not as keyboard input. By default, these signals are passed to all console processes that are attached to the console. (Detached processes are not affected.) The system creates a new thread in each client process to handle the event. The thread raises an exception if the process is being debugged. The debugger can handle the exception or continue with the exception unhandled.

CTRL+BREAK is always treated as a signal, but an application can change the default CTRL+C behavior in two ways that prevent the handler functions from being called:

    The SetConsoleMode function can disable the ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT input mode for a console's input buffer, so CTRL+C is reported as keyboard input rather than as a signal.
    When SetConsoleCtrlHandler is called with NULL and TRUE values for its parameters, the calling process ignores CTRL+C signals. Normal CTRL+C processing is restored by calling SetConsoleCtrlHandler with NULL and FALSE values. This attribute of ignoring or not ignoring CTRL+C signals is inherited by child processes, but it can be enabled or disabled by any process without affecting existing processes.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fj.mail-lists.x-window/Ln0l_9c98U0

The SIGINT signal that you are referring to is generated by the shell
on the receipt of a Control-C.  When you run your X program in the
foreground, from a shell, this causes it to die.  When a Control-C is
typed while the focus is in your X program's window it receives the
keypress event for the Control-C key.  What it does is up to you.  You
can check for it and exit your program if you wish.  But this is
strictly up to you.

Emacs-Babel allows a script to be used as a function. This makes sense because Emacs Babel is implemented in Emacs Lisp.

Leo-Babel is implemented in Python. Is it worthwhile for Leo-Babel to allow a script to be used as a function?

Treating scripts as functions requires implementing several options.

* Tag: Function name
* Value: function name

* Tag: Variables
* Value: List of variable names

The above is just about all I know about Emacs-Babel scripts as functions. I suspect there are many problems with the idea, and I've no desire to use scripts as functions.

Without the --disable-server command line option, Python thinks the subprocess terminates as soon as the terminal starts.
With the --disable-server, Python thinks the subprocess terminates when the terminal terminates.
Unfortuante, the terminal does NOT pass on the Bash/Python script's stdout and stderr output to the terminal's stdout and stderr, so my Python program never sees this output.

The terminal takes keyboard input, but it does NOT take stdin input from my program that started it.  My program hangs in
subPscript.communicate(input=pathScript) till the terminal terminates.  This means that Leo-Editor is so unresponsive that it can't even show its window when its window is brought to the top of the desktop.
#@+node:bob.20170508165225.1: *4* How does a remote terminal work?
I believe the only terminal involved is local.  I believe the program running on the remote CPU is a "remote terminal" program.  The "remote terminal" client running on the local CPU reads stdin and passes it to the remote terminal which uses a subprocess to execute it passing back stdout and stderr to the remote terminal client which passes them to its stdout and stderr which causes the terminal to display them.

None of this suggests any scheme that would do what I want to do.

I started Leo-Editor in workspace 2 on xubuntu.leo.
I used Alt-B to execute a script to backup files.  This ran a long time.
I started Leo-Editor in workspace 3 on /pri/gi/leoMySettings/code.leo.
I used Ctrl-B to execute a script in workspace 3.  This generated some messages to stderr.
These messages were echoed to the log pane in workspace 2.

I can't believe this.
I conjecture that what happened was I started Leo-Editor, I opened a second file in a second tab.  I split this tab off in a new window (right click, detach).  I moved the window to workspace 2.

But I could not reproduce the error without involving Leo-Babel.

Yes, in that '/pri/git/leo-editor/leo/plugins/leo_babel' points to /pri/git/leo-editor/leo/plugins.

But the includes

    from leo_babel import babel_api
    from leo_babel import babel_lib

Do not work for installation:

$ echo $PYTHONPATH
/pri/git:/pri/git/leo-editor

There is no __init__.py in leo-editor, there is in leo-editor/leo, and none in leo-editor/leo/plugins.

But the __init__.py in leo-editor/leo is the only one needed.  It makes it's whole subtree a package.

No.  But you can copy the UNL in the status line.  You need to add the protocol.

Having Babel call flush() on its read and write file descriptors does NOT help.  Babel's file descriptors do not buffer.  But the target script's file descriptors do buffer.

This is an issue only for Python scripts.  The Bash interpreter never buffers stdout or stderr.

xfce-teminal gets around this problem.  How?

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25372/turn-off-buffering-in-pipe

Note: On debian systems, this is called expect_unbuffer and is in the expect-dev package, not the expect package – bdonlan Jan 24 '11 at 11:14
---
unbuffer applied to the interpreter eliminates all buffering--but it redirects stderr to stdout.
I can't find anything about the unbuffer problem.
---

https://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/unix-buffering
Fortunately, in most recent Linux distributions (including TKL 11 / Ubuntu Lucid / Debian Squeeze) there's a new command called stdbuf which allows you to configure the default Unix buffering for an arbitrary program.

http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/stdio_buffering/

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3465619/how-to-make-output-of-any-shell-command-unbuffered



Try stdbuf, included in GNU coreutils and thus virtually any Linux distro. This sets the buffer length for input, output and error to zero:

stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 command

---
stdbuf applied to the interpreter does nothing.
stdbuf doesn't work for me.
---

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/107705/disable-output-buffering

The Python interpreter command line option -u causes it to unbuffer.

https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html
-u

    Force the binary layer of the stdout and stderr streams (which is available as their buffer attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console, or block-buffered if redirected to a non-interactive file.

    See also PYTHONUNBUFFERED.
----
https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html

 class subprocess.Popen(args, bufsize=-1, executable=None, stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, preexec_fn=None, close_fds=True, shell=False, cwd=None, env=None, universal_newlines=False, startupinfo=None, creationflags=0, restore_signals=True, start_new_session=False, pass_fds=(), *, encoding=None, errors=None)



Popen.stdout

    If the stdout argument was PIPE, this attribute is a readable stream object as returned by open(). Reading from the stream provides output from the child process. If the encoding or errors arguments were specified or the universal_newlines argument was True, the stream is a text stream, otherwise it is a byte stream. If the stdout argument was not PIPE, this attribute is None.
---
So the default is binary.
---


Popen.stderr

    If the stderr argument was PIPE, this attribute is a readable stream object as returned by open(). Reading from the stream provides error output from the child process. If the encoding or errors arguments were specified or the universal_newlines argument was True, the stream is a text stream, otherwise it is a byte stream. If the stderr argument was not PIPE, this attribute is None.
---
So the default is binary.

So I tried just using PIPE, and the first read hangs till the process terminates.

Consequently, there needs to be 4 processes:
    1) The Leo-Editor process
    2) The Babel process executing shell or Python.
    3) A process to call readline on the Babel process's stdout.
    4) A process to call readline on the Babel process's stderr.

I need a FIFO queue of lines for 3 to pass lines to 1.

1) creating an iterator from the read or readline functions
or
2) create a reader and a writer file. Pass the writer to the Popen and read from the reader.

The only advantage of the file approach is that your code doesn't block. So you can do whatever you want in the meantime and read whenever you want from the reader in a non-blocking way. When you use PIPE, read and readline functions will block until either one character is written to the pipe or a line is written to the pipe respectively.

Maybe a Python script with no exception handlers would not be terminated either?

Bash signals

Kill bash running in a subprocess

https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Signals.html

When Bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores SIGTERM (so that ‘kill 0’ does not kill an interactive shell), and SIGINT is caught and handled (so that the wait builtin is interruptible). When Bash receives a SIGINT, it breaks out of any executing loops. In all cases, Bash ignores SIGQUIT. If job control is in effect (see Job Control), Bash ignores SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.

Non-builtin commands started by Bash have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT in addition to these inherited handlers. Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.

The shell exits by default upon receipt of a SIGHUP. Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the SIGHUP to all jobs, running or stopped. Stopped jobs are sent SIGCONT to ensure that they receive the SIGHUP. To prevent the shell from sending the SIGHUP signal to a particular job, it should be removed from the jobs table with the disown builtin (see Job Control Builtins) or marked to not receive SIGHUP using disown -h.

If the huponexit shell option has been set with shopt (see The Shopt Builtin), Bash sends a SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

---
Solution:

If the Bash script does not handle SIGHUP, then SIGHUP terminates the Bash interpreter.
If the Python script does not handle SIGHUP, then SIGHUP terminates the Python interpreter.
