r""" Allows the definition of double-click actions.

Calling the nodeaction-act command or double-clicking a node causes this plugin
checks for a match of the clicked node's headline text with a list of
patterns. If a match occurs, the plugin executes the associated script.

**nodeAction** nodes may be located anywhere in the outline. Such nodes
should contain one or more **pattern nodes** as children. The headline of
each pattern node contains the pattern; the body text contains the script
to be executed when the pattern matches the double-clicked node.

For example, the "nodeActions" node containing a "launch URL" pattern node
and a "pre-process python code" node could be placed under an "@settings"
node::

   @settings
   |
   +- nodeActions
      |
      +- http:\\*
      |
      +- @file *.py

**Configuration**

The nodeActions plugin supports the following global configurations using
Leo's support for setting global variables within an @settings node's
sub-nodes in the leoSettings.leo, myLeoSettings.leo, and the project Leo
file:

@bool nodeActions_save_atFile_nodes = False

  :True:
     The double-click-icon-box command on an @file type node will save the
     file to disk before executing the script.

  :False:
     The double-click-icon-box command on an @file type node will **not**
     save the file to disk before executing the script. (default)

@int nodeActions_message_level = 1

  Specifies the type of messages to be sent to the log pane.  Specifying a
  higher message level will display that level and all lower levels.
  The following integer values are supported::

    0 no messages
    1 Plugin triggered and the patterns that were matched (default)
    2 Double-click event passed or not to next plugin
    3 Patterns that did not match
    4 Code debugging messages

**Patterns**

Pattern matching is performed using python's support for Unix
shell-style patterns unless overwritten by the "X" pattern directive.
The following pattern elements are supported::

    *           matches everything
    ?           matches any single character
    [<seq>]     matches any character in <seq>
    [!<seq>]    matches any character **not** in <seq>

Unix shell-style pattern matching is case insensitive and always starts from
the beginning of the headline.  For example:

     ======= =========== ==============
     Pattern   Matches   Does not match
     ======= =========== ==============
     \*.py   Abc_Test.py
     .py     .py - Test  Abc_Test.py
     test*   Test_Abc.py Abc_Test.py
     ======= =========== ==============

To enable a script to run on any type of @file node (@thin, @shadow, ...),
the pattern can start with "@files" to match on any
external file type.  For example, the pattern "@files \*.py" will
match a node with the headline "@file abcd.py".

The double-click-icon-box command matches the headline of the node against
the patterns starting from the first sub-node under the "nodeActions" node
to the last sub-node.

Only the script associated with the first matching pattern is
invoked unless overwritten by the "V" pattern directive.

Using the "V" pattern directive allows a broad pattern such
as "@files \*.py" to be invoked, and then, by placing a more restrictive
pattern above it, such as "@files \*_test.py", a different script can be
executed for those files requiring pre-processing::

  +- nodeActions
     |
     +- @files *_test.py
     |
     +- @files *.py

**Note**: To prevent Leo from trying to save patterns that begin with a derived
file directive (@file, @auto, ...) to disk, such as "@file \*.py", place the
"@ignore" directive in the body of the "nodeActions" node.

Pattern nodes can be placed at any level under the "nodeActions" node.
Only nodes with no child nodes are considered pattern nodes.
This allows patterns that are to be used in multiple Leo files to be read
from a file.  For example, the following structure reads the pattern
definition from the "C:\\Leo\\nodeActions_Patterns.txt" file::

    +- nodeActions
    |
    +- @files C:\\Leo\\nodeActions_Patterns.txt
        |
        +- http:\\*
        |
        +- @file *.py

**Pattern directives**

The following pattern specific directives can be appended to the end of a
pattern (do not include the ':'):

:[X]:
  Use python's regular expression type patterns instead of the Unix
  shell-style pattern syntax.

  For example, the following patterns will match the same headline string::

     Unix shell-style pattern:
        @files *.py

     Regular Expression pattern:
        ^@files .*\.py$ [X]

:[V]:
  Matching the pattern will not block the double-click event from
  being passed to the remaining patterns.
  The "V" represents a down arrow that symbolizes the passing of the event
  to the next pattern below it.

  For example, adding the "[V]" directive to the "@files \*_test.py" in
  the Patterns section above, changes its script from being 'an
  alternate to' to being 'a pre-processor for' the "@files \*.py" script::

     +- nodeActions
        |
        +- @files *_test.py [V]
        |
        +- @files *.py

:[>]:
  Matching the pattern will not block the double-click event from being
  passed to other plugins.
  The ">" represents a right arrow that
  symbolizes the passing of the event to the next plugin.

  If the headline matched more than one headline,
  the double-click event will be passed to the next plugin if the
  directive is associated with any of the matched patterns.

The directive(s) for a pattern must be contained within a single set of
brackets, separated from the pattern by a space, with or without a comma
separator.  For example, the following specifies all three directives::

    ^@files .*\.py$ [X,V>]

**Scripts**

The script for a pattern is located in the body of the pattern's node.
The following global variables are available to the script::

    c
    g
    pClicked - node position of the double-clicked node
    pScript - node position of the invoked script

**Examples**

The nodeaction-act command on a node with a
"http:\\\\www.google.com" headline will invoke the script associated with
the "http:\\\\\*" pattern. The following script in the body of the
pattern's node displays the URL in a browser::

     import webbrowser
     hClicked = pClicked.h     #Clicked node's Headline text
     webbrowser.open(hClicked) #Invoke browser

The following script can be placed in the body of a pattern's node to
execute a command in the first line of the body of a double-clicked node::

     g.os.system('"Start /b ' + pClicked.bodyString() + '"')
