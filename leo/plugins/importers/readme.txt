leo/plugins/importers/readme.txt

This is the readme.txt file for Leo's importers in the leo/plugins/importers folder.

Each .py file in this folder (except basescanner.py) is an **importer** for one particular computer language.

Leo uses an importer when explicitly importing a file, and when reading any kind of @auto tree.

For detailed instructions about how to write an importer, see leo/plugins/importers/howto.txt.
