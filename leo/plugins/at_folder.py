r'''Synchronizes @folder nodes with folders.

If a node is named '\@folder *<path_to_folder>*', the content (filenames) of the
folder and the children of that node will be sync. Whenever a new file is put
there, a new node will appear on top of the children list (with mark). So that
I can put my description (annotation) as the content of that node. In this
way, I can find any files much easier from leo.

Moreover, I add another feature to allow you to group files(in leo) into
children of another group. This will help when there are many files in that
folder. You can logically group it in leo (or even clone it to many groups),
while keep every files in a flat/single directory on your computer.
