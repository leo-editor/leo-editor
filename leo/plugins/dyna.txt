to use you pylint need both.

http://www.logilab.org/projects/common
%HOME% .pylintrc
see how to get the rc file below

for pychecker
http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/
%HOME% .pycheckrc
in test.leo I think there is a good rc file for pychecker

http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html
http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/tut.html


astyle macro, reformat c, java/javascript code
http://astyle.sourceforge.net/  
can use  ~/.astylerc not included


syntax highlight from htmlize
docutils
silvercity
source-highlight


for subprocess for python less than v2.4
replaces popen and used to call various externals
pychecker source-highlight and others
http://effbot.org/download

not sure it helps, might even slow things down
but if its installed a few macros can enable it.
http://psyco.sourceforge.net/ 




set HOME=c:\sve\mii or whatever in your .rc or autoexec.bat
or somehow set HOME or export in your env 
or use the os default for home if there is one.
many programs look in your home for .rc files

it may also be possible to set which config on the command line
for some of the chekers or source highlighters.

   few macros expect python 2.3 or python 2.4 modules.
   instruction how to get modules from cvs are on c.l.py
 cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/python/python/nondist/sandbox/csv

   some modules that have been left in compatible python source 
   on cvs will work in py2.2 or less.
   textwrap, csv, sets, iterators, datetime and the list is growing.

    you may need generators and enumerate for some operations.
    py2.2 you can uncomment from  __future__ import generators
    enumerate you have to search a little. dyna_menu has enumerate.
    or ask on IRC. (Internet Relay Chat)
     
type in: 
/server irc.freenode.net 
/join #Leo  
from an IRC client sometime! 
if you have Leo questions or answers. 
    #python too. ask good questions get good answers.
    and many open source projects have channels there.

   c.l.py is the usenet comp.lang.python gated mailing list
   source of all knowledge and misinformation about python.
   time marches on, Leo backward compatibility is not perfect either.

other dependencies are in the doc strings of the individual macro's 
many of them are just shells that produce some typical output 
to use as a template if the need arises. url's included
or use http://www.python.org/pypi/ 
or Vaults of Parnassus  http://www.vex.net/~x/parnassus/ 
 or the archive of google site:python.org
 help(module) 
 help needs to installed python docs and PYTHONDOC env variable set.
or run pydoc in gui mode 
or search the index in the chm a python install should setup
a shortcut for you and for other systems there are chm readers.

aspn recipes refer to numbers add the number after this url
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/

don't forget the dead tree version of information exchange
for the python cookbook and many other titles.
and the many link sites for python have links to articles
or tutorials that should be read and tested more than once.

@  rc option files & url's for pychecker and pylint

1> executeScript on this node will insert 
the proper path to your home directory
as the first line of this node.
if it looks ok, remove the #comment to enable it.
of course, you can just setup the path however you want
no executescript is required, just another toy to play with.

2> remove ignore from at least pylint and pycheckrc
check over details in the subnodes,
although they both may work ok w/o rc files or with these as defaults.
rc files are not one size fits all for every project and small script
in some cases may have to specify an rc file on the command line.
tags files is for source-highlite

3> if you already have rc files,
before you save the leo do read @file first
or don't remove the ignore on those you don't want to generate.

4>  write @file here to generate your
pchecker and pylint rc files
or save the leo as the case may be.
nothing could be simpler...

5> this has not been tested on all systems.
worst case if no suitable home can be found
you must insert a proper path yourself.
worst case than that, please post a traceback
or some indication how it failed.

6. as to pychecker and pylint being able to find
the rc, if there are problems you may have to try
to run them from the commandline to see whats what.
you might try to set the env variable home=somewhere
on nix systems this would probably never be necessary.
although you cuold want to have the rc file accessable 
for all users, I have no idea how to make that happen.

7. with .name  files, there have been reports of some 
problems on older windows. I've never had a problem.

preincluded leo and silvercity at the end, so firefox works better
is not fully compatible yet. not sure why but @import url() failed.

generate file rename to default.css where you will generate @rst nodes
I guess htmlize should use this file as well.
some kind of script to automatically change the font size and style
to suite individulat taste would probably not be much work.
some simplification is in order and some duplication is evident.


there is also the problem of adding Rest directives on the fly
and keeping the css up to date.
code-block is one
simple too small

    -pM, --port=M  connect to port M
    
   If you want to debug a script that is run from an embedded interpreter,
        add 'rpdb.set_active()' in the beginning of your script. This will 
        make the calls to 'rpdb.set_trace()' break into the debugger (they
        will not be ignored). Don't forget to add an extra 'rpdb.set_trace()'
        for your main thread. You also need to manually start rpdb.py in 
        server mode before you run your script.

#run the bat first to start rpdb in server mode

#q will exit the console and return control to leo

HappyDoc3-r3_0_a1 from happydoc.sourceforge.net or pydoc (in stdlib).
need PYTHONDOCS env set and download the help from python.org
for print help(whatever) type answers. think pydoc imports the module.

happydoc doesn't import so is safe on untrusted code. but is proving
to be quite out of date so will try something from docutils sandbox
other apps like epydoc also possible. why does noone think of scriptability!
everything is input file and output file and no mention of anything else.
