"""
leo_cloud.py - synchronize Leo subtrees with remote central server

(this is the server half, see also leo_cloud.py for the Leo plugin)

See Phase 2 notes in leo_cloud.py - this file is a *stub* for a Leo aware
LeoCloudIOLeoServer which allows more granular and real-time synchronization
than simple git / Google Drive / DropBox style LeoCloudIO* classes.
I.e. as of 20170924 this is just a place holder awaiting development.
