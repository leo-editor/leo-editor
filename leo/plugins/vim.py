''' Enables two-way communication with VIM.

This plugin provides the ``vim-open-node`` command, which opens the
selected node in vim. This *supersedes* the old way of opening nodes by
double-clicking the icon box.

Commands
--------

The **vim-open-node** command opens the selected node in vim. Leo will
update the node in the outline when you save the file in vim.

Installation
------------

Enable this plugin as usual and set the ``vim_cmd`` and ``vim_exe``
settings as shown below. Alternatively, you can ensure that gvim.exe is on
your PATH. gvim is recommended, not the basic console vim.

Settings
--------

**@string vim_cmd** (Important!): The command to execute to start gvim.
Something like::
    
    <path-to-gvim>/gvim --servername LEO

**@string vim_exe** (Important!): The path to the gvim executable.

**vim_plugin_positions_cursor**: Leo will put Vim cursor at same location as
Leo cursor in file.

**vim_plugin_uses_tab_feature**: Leo will put node in a Vim tab card.

# Contributed by Andrea Galimberti.
# Edited by Felix Breuer.
# 
# 1.5 EKR:
#     - Added new sections.
#     - Move most comments into docstring.
#     - Added useDoubleClick variable.
#     - Added init function.
#     - Init _vim_cmd depending on sys.platform.
# 1.6 EKR:
#     - Use keywords to get c, not g.top().
#     - Don't use during unit testing: prefer xemacs instead.
#     - Added _vim_exe
#     - Use "os.spawnv" instead of os.system.
#     - Simplified the search of g.app.openWithFiles.
#     - Fixed bug in open_in_vim: hanged v.bodyString to v.bodyString()
# 1.7 EKR: Excellent new code by Jim Sizelove solves weird message on first open of vim.
# 1.8 EKR: Set subprocess = None if import fails.
# 1.9 EKR:
#     - Document how install subproces, and use g.importExtension to import subprocess.
#     - Import subprocess with g.importExtension.
# 1.10 EKR:
#     - Support 'vim_cmd' and 'vim_exe' settings.
#     - These override the default _vim_cmd and _vim_exe settings.
# 1.11 EKR: Emergency default for window is now the default location: c:\Program Files\vim\vim63
# 1.12 EKR:
#     - Added emergency default for 'darwin'.
#     - Corrected the call to openWith.  It must now use data=data due to a new event param.
# 1.13 EKR: The docstring now states that the open_with plugin must be enabled for this to work.
# 1.14 EKR: Emphasized that the open_with plugin must be enabled.
# 1.15 EKR: Don't open @url nodes in vim if @bool vim_plugin_opens_url_nodes setting is False.
# 1.16 TL: open_in_vim modifications
#     - support file open in gVim at same line number as Leo cursor location
#     - support file open in a gVim tab (see also mod_tempfname.py)
# 1.17 EKR: Give a location message to help with settings.
# 1.18 VMV:
#     - Use gvim on Linux too, emergency default on Windows doesn't have explicit path
#     - Works when subprocess.Popen(shell=True)
# 2.0 EKR: Use *only* the vim-open-node command.  Do not pollute click handlers.

#@+at I was trying to get Leo to work more effectively with Vim, my editor of choice.
# To do so, I made several changes to Leo which (I believe) make it work better.
# 
# After much exploring and trying various things, I made a change to the os.spawnv
# section of the openWith function in leoCommands.py. This added line seems to
# prevent the "weird error message on first open of Vim." (vim.py, line 32) when
# opening Vim with os.spawnv.
# 
# os.spawnv needs the command it is calling as the first argument in the args list
# in addition, so the command actually shows twice in the total args to os.spawnv,
# e.g.::
#     os.spawnv(os.P_NOWAIT, "C:/Program Files/Vim/vim63/gvim.exe",
#         ["gvim.exe", "--servername", "LEO", "--remote", "foo.txt"])
# If the call is made without the command-name as the first item in the list of
# args, like so::
#     os.spawnv(os.P_NOWAIT, "C:/Program Files/Vim/vim63/gvim.exe",
#         ["--servername", "LEO", "--remote", "foo.txt"])
# 
# an error message pops up::
#     E247: no registered server named "GVIM": Send failed.  Trying to execute locally
# This message means that gVim is not looking for a server named "LEO", which
# presumably the user has already opened with the command "gvim --servername LEO".
# Instead it is looking for a server named "GVIM", and not finding it, opens the
# files "foo.txt" and "LEO" (notice that it didn't catch the "--servername"
# argument and thinks that "LEO" is the name of a new file to create) in two
# buffers in a local copy of gVim. Now, if the command is::
# 
#     os.spawnv(
#         os.P_NOWAIT, "C:/Program Files/Vim/vim63/gvim.exe",
#         ["gvim.exe", "--servername", "LEO", "--remote", "foo.txt"])
# 
# everything works great, as long as the user doesn't close the gVim window. If
# the user has closed the gVim window, then tries to open a node in Vim, they will
# see this error message::
# 
#     E247: no registered server named "LEO": Send failed.
# 
# Trying to execute locally If you use the "--remote-silent" argument, gVim will
# start the LEO server without the error message.
# 
# One other comment:  you can see which servers gVim has running by typing::
# 
#     vim --serverlist
# 
# at the command prompt.
# 
# The rest of my changes have to do with using the subprocess module instead of
# the os.system, and various os.spawn* calls. I find subprocess easier to
# understand, and it is fairly simple to use for the most common kinds of process
# calls, but is capable of all the variations you may need. It is designed to
# replace all the os.system, os.spawn*, and popen* calls. It is available in
# Python 2.4.
# 
# So I added some lines to use subprocess in the OpenWith plugin and the Vim plugin.
# 
# I also have added a table in the "create_open_with_menu" function that makes use of the various editors I have used at times.  Most of those editors are called with subprocess.Popen.
