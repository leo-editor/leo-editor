Preface
-------

Leo2AsciiDoc is a small Python program which has been
built to be used as a plugin module for the Leo outlining editor.

Leo2AsciiDoc enables the contents of Leo outlines to be published to HTML
or PDF via the DocBook set of publishing tools.  Plain text from the
Leo outline is transformed into a final result that has:

    - typeset body text, in which bulleted and numbered lists,
      variable lists, page numbers, URLs, index terms,and bold and
      italic text are automatically recognized.
    - typeset Headings
    - a Table of Contents
    - an Index containing any items marked by the user, and any
      Python classes or functions.

As you will see, there's not a lot involved in using the
Leo2AsciiDoc module.  It simply copies text from a Leo outline (or a
portion of a Leo outline) to a text file.  In turn that text file can
be automatically converted by the AsciiDoc program and a DocBook
system to properly typeset DocBook HTML, PDF or other formats.

If you keep your text plain, and use a few simple formatting
conventions, the final output can have typeset headings, bulleted
lists, indexing and cross-referencing, as well as many other
features.

*note*

Leo2AsciiDoc is suited for general text documents, most programming
documentation and most business documents.  Leo2AsciiDoc (being based on
DocBook) is not the choice for anyone needing detailed typographic
control of individual words or characters -- for example, typeset
equations.  In general, DocBook typesets blocks of text.

@ascskip # Time-stamp: "Fri, Jan  9 15:19 CST 2004  michael@redpriest About_this_document_140583820.txt"

If you are reading this document in HTML (in a web browser) or as a
PDF file (usually in Adobe Acrobat Reader), it may interest you to
know that this document was generated from a Leo outline.

The Leo outline (in the file mod_leo2ascd.leo) contained the
Leo2AsciiDoc Users Guide, the Leo2AsciiDoc Developers Guide, and all
the Leo2AsciiDoc source code.  All of them were created by simply
typing plain text.

The working source code was exported by Leo using the "File; Tangle;
Tangle" menu selection, which created the Python program file
"mod_leo2ascd.py".

The Users Guide and the Developers Guide were created by exporting
the text from Leo, using the menu selection "File; Export; Export
All to AsciiDoc".  This created the plain text files
"mod_asc_user.asc" and "mod_asc_dev.asc" (which are the file names I
told Leo to use.)

I then typed "make all" at the console in the directory, and the
make program:

    - ran the AsciiDoc program to produce the DocBook XML files.
    - ran the xsltproc program to produce the HTML files from the
      XML files.
    - ran the xsltproc program to produce "fo" files, and ran the
      fop program to produce PDF files from the fo files.

Everything was generated automatically without any further work on
my part.

Using Leo2AsciiDoc is as simple as choosing the Leo menu item: "File;
Export; Export All to AsciiDoc".  From there, you have the AsciiDoc
program and the DocBook system automatically convert your outline to
HTML or PDF (or to a manpage or a DocBook website.)

Step by step:

    - You need a Leo outline containing some plain text, or plain
      text and code.
    - You ensure that the top node in the outline (or part of the
      outline tree which you want to be a separate document) must
      have an @ascfile directive in the body text. The @ascfile
      directive is used to specify the filename in which the output
      text will be put.
    - You then use Leo's menu: "File; Export; Export All to
      AsciiDoc" (or one of the other Leo2AsciiDoc menu items) to
      have Leo2AsciiDoc automatically export the outline to a text file.
    - After that, you run the AsciiDoc program on the exported text
      file, and process it as a DocBook document.  Most often,
      people have a Make file set up to do this automatically.

In practice, people often want to use special features:

    - plain text formatting, sometimes referred to as "structured
      text" or "minimal markup"
    - Leo2AsciiDoc configuration options

The following sections cover this.  If you've downloaded the Leo2AsciiDoc
package, the mod_leo2asc.leo outline is available, and illustrates
all the features.  It is the outline from which all the Leo2AsciiDoc HTML
and PDF documentation and code were derived.

@code
#@+node:ekr.20040331071919.41: *4* Directives
@doc
@ascskip # Time-stamp: "Mon, Jan 19 13:19 CST 2004  michael@redpriest Directives_140672364.txt"

The following are non-printing directives that you can insert into
your outline text to control Leo2AsciiDoc behaviour.  All must be at the
beginning of the line.

{amp}commat;ascfile::
    e.g: `@ascfile "doc/mod_asc_user.asc" `

    Ascfile is the equivalent of a Leo @root directive. Ascfile
    signals the start of a document and specifies the file name to
    receive the text.

    The default directory is the directory containing the Leo
    outline.  If you were editing an outline that resided in
    /home/me then the above ascfile directive would create the file
    mod_asc/user.asc in the directory /home/me/doc.

{amp}commat;ascignore::
    Ascignore causes Leo2AsciiDoc to ignore the outline node, and any
    sub-nodes. It must be placed before any line in the node which
    will print.

{amp}commat;ascskip::
    Causes Leo2AsciiDoc to skip the line.  If followed by the word "on",
    causes Leo2AsciiDoc to skip all succeeding document lines until an
    "{amp}commat;ascskip off" directive is read, or a code section is reached.

{amp}commat;ascexit::
    Causes Leo2AsciiDoc to exit the outline node without processing any
    further lines.  Sub-nodes will be processed.

{amp}commat;ascconfig::
    e.g. `{amp}commat;ascconfig maxCodeLineLength 70` -- see
    Configuration below.


@code
#@+node:ekr.20040331071919.42: *5* Configuration
@doc
@ascskip # Time-stamp: "Mon, Jan 19 13:20 CST 2004  michael@redpriest Configuration_140673612.txt"

There are a few configuration settings which may be set in an
outline.  To take effect, they must be placed:

    - in the top node of the outline, or
    - the same node as an @ascfile directive.

Configuration settings in the top node of the outline are effective
for the whole outline, unless overridden by settings in sub-nodes.

maxCodeLineLength::
    e.g. `{amp}commat;ascconfig maxCodeLineLength 70` --
    sets the maximum length of code printout lines to 70 characters.
    Longer lines will be wrapped and a line continuation character
    displayed.

PrintHeadings::
    e.g. `{amp}commat;ascconfig PrintHeadings off` -- turns off the
    export of outline node headings as section titles.  In that
    case, you must have correctly entered AsciiDoc section titles in
    the body text of your outline.

Readers of the code will note that there are other configuration
settings in the code. These will be used in future, and so I won't
document them yet.

@doc
@ascskip # Time-stamp: "Mon, Jan 19 13:22 CST 2004  michael@redpriest Markup_140672220.txt"

The point of using a system like AsciiDoc is to get a document that
is properly typeset, while writing only plain text with as little
embedded formatting instruction as possible.

For the most part, you simply write chunks of text, which become
typeset paragraphs.

I've tried to use most commonly used markup in the Leo outline that
contains all the Leo2AsciiDoc source and documentation, so that you
can see exactly how markup may be used.

This section illustrates a very small part of the standard AsciiDoc
markup.  However, AsciiDoc comes with extensive documentation of its
own, which any Leo2AsciiDoc user should read.

@doc
@ascskip # Time-stamp: "Thu, Jan  8 14:06 CST 2004  michael@redpriest Headings_141020668.txt"

indexterm:[Markup, Headings]
Leo2AsciiDoc will automatically create Headings from the headings of
your Leo outline.  You can turn this off (see Configuration), and
create your own headings in the body text of an outline node.  For
example, a Chapter heading is text at the left margin that has a
following line of dashes.  For example,

@code
 Operation
 ---------

@doc
is the heading of this chapter.  Chapter sub-sections have a
following line of tildes.  For example,

@code

 Markup
 ~~~~~~

@doc

is the heading of Section One of this chapter.  Section Two markup
is a following line of "^".  For example,

@code

Standard AsciiDoc Markup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
@doc

is the heading of the section, which is a Section Two.

As I say, you normally don't need to do this, since Leo2AsciiDoc does all
this itself from the outline headings.

Bulleted lists start with a dash (or asterisk) followed by a space
or tab character.  I've extended this to allow leading spaces.  For
example,

@code
    - this is a list item

Preface
-------

Leo2AsciiDoc is a small Python program which has been built to be used as
a plugin module for the Leo outlining editor.

This is the Developer Documentation and source code listing of
Leo2AsciiDoc.

Leo2AsciiDoc enables the contents of Leo outlines to be published to
HTML or PDF via the DocBook XML set of publishing tools.  Plain text
from the Leo outline is transformed into a final result that has:

    - typeset body text, in which bulleted and numbered lists,
      variable lists, page numbers, URLs, index terms,and bold and
      italic text are automatically recognized.
    - typeset Headings
    - a Table of Contents
    - an Index containing any items marked by the user, and any
      Python classes or functions.

indexterm:[Literate Programming]
For programmers, Leo2AsciiDoc enables a simplified version of
Literate Programming: all the documentation and code for a program
can be written in a Leo outline, and published with just a few
keystrokes.  As is normal for a Leo outline, Leo can also extract
the source code from the outline and package it into text files,
ready to be run or compiled.

Specifically, what the Leo2AsciiDoc program does is:

    - wait to be called by the Leo menu (File; Export; Export to
      AsciiDoc), and then
    - read a part of a Leo outline, and
    - write the contents to a text file that can be understood by
      the AsciiDoc program.

From there:

    - the xref:AsciiDoc[] program can then convert that text file to
      another text file that is in the DocBook XML format.
    - the standard collection of xref:DocBook[] tools can then format the
      text in HTML (web page) files or as a typeset PDF file.
    - Once set up, the whole process happens quickly and
      automatically, usually with a simple "make" command.

@language plain
@doc
@ascskip # Time-stamp: "Fri, Jan  9 16:00 CST 2004  michael@redpriest The_General_Approach_140588436.txt"

Leo2AsciiDoc simply copies the text from a portion of a Leo outline
to a text file.  That text file can then be processed by other
programs to produce HTML, PDF's, etc.

The text will be copied from each outline item, in outline order,
though you can skip individual nodes or sub-trees.

The idea is that you write the outline as a book, or series of
books.

If your book contains source code, you can break it up into pieces
that make it convenient to review with the reader.  Additionally,
you can discuss the pieces in any order that you like.  Using the
"tangle" command, Leo will be able to assemble and reorder the
pieces in the order required for a file of compilable source code.

As the text is copied from the outline, Leo2AsciiDoc adds minimal markup,
generally:

    - It marks up node headlines as Titles and Section Headings
      in the AsciiDoc format.
    - Program listings have AsciiDoc section markers inserted before
      and after.

A specific list follows.

    - headings:
        * By default, all outline node headings are underlined with
          the appropriate section underline character, which
          AsciiDoc will use to transform the headings into titles:
          chapter, section1, section2, etc.
        * code extracts are given an "example" heading.
    - source code sections are marked with delimiters, so that they
      can be assigned to the DocBook "programlisting" element.
    - source code sections are line-wrapped in the document output,
      for convenient html display.
    - wherever source code is exported to a source code file, the
      document with note this with an automatically generated "note"
      element.

The appendices are about other programs that are used with Leo.
I'm including them because they are examples of how my setup works,
for those who may be interested in setting up something similar.

    - AsciiDoc is the program that processes the output from Leo2AsciiDoc
      into a DocBook-ready XML file.
    - Setting up DocBook is a topic that is far too large for this
      little manual, but the DocBook section which follows contains
      documentation of exactly how my working system is configured.
    - The XEmacs text editor is the one I prefer, but it is not
      necessary for the use of Leo2AsciiDoc.  Others who also use XEmacs
      might find the documentation of my Leo integration and
      multi-mode support to be useful.

The AsciiDoc program is written by Stuart Rackham and has its own
web site at http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[], with full
documentation.

AsciiDoc is a small program, written in Python, that reads text
which is in the AsciiDoc text format. Generally speaking, ordinary
text (such as you would write in an email message) is already in the
AsciiDoc format.  The AsciiDoc program produces (among other
choices) output in the DocBook XML format.

Text exported from a Leo outline by Leo2AsciiDoc is ready to be processed
by AsciiDoc, once AsciiDoc has been configured to recognize it.

Leo2AsciiDoc comes with an AsciiDoc configuration file that will enable
AsciiDoc to process all Leo2AsciiDoc features.  The following section
describes that configuration file.

Of course, you don't need to read or understand the configuration
file to use it.  Simply put it (leo-docbook.conf) in the same
directory as AsciiDoc's "docbook.conf" file.  When you invoke
AsciiDoc (see the xref:Makefile[] section in the DocBook appendix for
examples), give the "leo-docbook.conf" file as the configuration
parameter ("-f leo-docbook.conf".)

AsciiDoc is customized through the use of configuration files, which
cascade, so that you can include other configuration files and
then proceed to add your changes.

The main elements of the configuration file below:

    - adds chapter and web site document types
    - switches code listings to use the DocBook "programlisting"
      element

    *note*

    If you choose to export this configuration file from the Leo
    outline, you will have to remove escape charactersfrom some
    lines after you have exported it.

    Specifically, some lines begin with the character "\".  That
    character should be removed.

I've patched the source code for AsciiDoc (asciidoc.py) with a few
small changes to allow AsciiDoc to process chapters and DocBook
web site documents as well as the DocBook book format.  Since I use
Linux, I also changed the default line-ending code to the Linux
default.

For the exact changes I made, the following output at the end of
this section was created by GNU diff (version 2.8.4) with the
command

---
LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 diff -Naur 5.0.2-original 5.0.2-mrc-patched \
    >mrc-asciidoc-5.0.2-patch-diff
---

I include this mainly so that you can see the exact changes I made.
However, you may want to patch a copy of the original in exactly the
same way.

To patch a copy of the original asciidoc.py (version 5.0.2), one
would use the patch command as follows (when in the same directory
as the copy of asciidoc.py and mrc-asciidoc-5.0.2-patch-diff)

anchor:DocBook[DocBook]
DocBook is a project that provides:

    - a specification for the text markup (DTD) of DocBook XML
      documents, and
    - a set of XSLT stylesheets that can be used by an XSLT engine
      to transform those XML documents to HTML, PDF, etc.

If you create your text documents using the rules in the DocBook
DTD, you can use the DocBook XSLT stylesheets to produce various
output formats, such as HTML and PDF.

The DocBook project is designed for the production of computer
documentation, but is actually used for a wide variety of documents.

Some web resources:

    - the official home page for DocBook: The Definitive Guide:
        http://docbook.org/[]
    - DocBook Basics:
        http://www.dpawson.co.uk/docbook/reference.html[]
    - DocBook Open Repository:
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/[]
    - DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide:
        http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/index.html[]

I include this section as documentation of one setup that works --
it translates Leo2AsciiDoc output to HTML and PDF.

This is not a guide to the installation, setup and operation of
DocBook, just an example of a working system.

@doc
@ascskip # Time-stamp: "Thu, Jan  8 13:57 CST 2004  michael@redpriest _Tool_Chain__140810780.txt"

Documents go through a number of stages in their creation.  Each
stage may involve one or more tools or programs, which form a tool
chain: each performing some processing and handing off to the next.

As a simple example, for this document:


    - text creation was handled by XEmacs, a text
      editor (which functioned as a Leo plugin.)
      indexterm:[XEmacs]
      indexterm:[GNU Make]
      indexterm:[AsciiDoc]
      indexterm:[xsltproc]
      indexterm:[FOP]
    - text storage and organization was handled by Leo, an outlining
      editor.
    - text was exported from Leo to a plain-text file, using the
      Leo2AsciiDoc program.
    - from there, all transformations are automated by the
      GNU Make program.
    - the DocBook XML document was created by the
      AsciiDoc program, which transformed the
      plain-text file to XML.
    - The HTML pages were created by the
      xsltproc program. xsltproc read the XML
      document, and the DocBook XSLT stylesheets, and then created
      each HTML page.
    - To make the PDF file, the xsltproc program used the same
      process as for the HTML pages, except that it created a
      Formatting Objects (FO) file instead.  Then the
      FOP program processed the FO file, producing
      the final PDF file.  This process was also automated.

All I did was type in text for each section, arranging it much as I
usually do for email.  The rest was handled automatically by
clicking on a Leo menu, or entering a short command at the console.
For example: "make all".

There are many, many choices of tools to put in your DocBook tool
chain.  You can even purchase complete packages, from text editing
to PDF generation.

anchor:Makefile[Makefile]
In my case, I use a standard unix-style "make" setup for processing
the text exported from a Leo outline.  It simply automates the
commands which I would otherwise have to type at the command line.

After Leo2AsciiDoc exports the text from the Leo outline to a disk file,
the Make program takes over.  It reads rules in a file named
"Makefile" and calls the necessary programs to make the
requested output.

This Makefile takes over where Leo2AsciiDoc leaves off.  It directs the
AsciiDoc conversion of the Leo2AsciiDoc text file to XML, and then the
DocBook conversion of the XML file to HTML pages or a PDF document.

indexterm:[GNU Make]
I use GNU Make.  For example, assuming I am in xterm and located in
the same directory as the Makefile, I just enter the command

---
make pdf-dev
---
and the make program guides the creation of the PDF version of The
Developers Guide, using the instructions in this Makefile.  The PDF
is available within seconds.

The Makefile instructions, in brief:

    - the AsciiDoc program is called to make an XML file.
    - the xsltproc program is called to process the XML file to
      either HTML or a Formatting Objects file for further
      translation to PDF
        * various XSLT style sheets (html.xsl, man.xsl, etc.) are
          used by xsltproc to guide the transformation of the XML
          file.  Typically, they call the DocBook stylesheets for
          the heavy lifting, and set a few simple options.
    - the FOP program is used to process the intermediate fo file to
      the final PDF file.

This is by no means a model Makefile.  It is included because it
works for me in my office, and may thus be useful as an example for
other people who want to set up Make for this purpose.

When the Makefile calls the xsltproc program, it gives it the name
of an XSLT stylesheet to guide the production of the result.

Following are simple XSLT stylesheets that are used to:
    - set formatting options, and
    - call the main DocBook XSLT stylesheets.

The stylesheets cascade (each adding its options to the total), with
the original stylesheet including others as needed, and always
calling the main DocBook stylesheets at some point.

This is the entire customize style sheet ("customize.xsl", which is
used by the Makefile to make changes to the standard xml file
produced from the AsciiDoc output.  It results in a file suffixed
".final.xml" which is used by both the HTML and PDF stylesheets.

Currently, the stylesheet copies the xml file:

    - changing any chapter elements that have a title beginning
      with "Appendix: " to DocBook appendix elements.  This is from
      AsciiDoc 3.2 days, when AsciiDoc didn't know about appendix
      elements. I haven't yet modified Leo2AsciiDoc to take
      advantage of the automatic appendix elements in AsciiDoc 5.0.
    - adding custom bookinfo elements

I've used XSLT for this, but it could have been done with python,
AWK, sed, or other tools.

For individual section pages of HTML, we import the DocBook stylesheets
and our small custom stylesheets that set our standard options.

Then we set our chunking options, and tell the web pages where to
find the header and footer graphics.

that is XEmacs.  Fortunately, Leo integrates with XEmacs quite well.

The following items are code I use, some Leo Python plugins and some
XEmacs elisp functions.  You may find them useful.

Leo's Open_With plugin can be modified so that the body text of any
outline node can be edited in XEmacs by choosing "File; OpenWith;
XEmacs" or "File; OpenWith; XEmacs - noshow"  from the menu.

What actually happens is that Leo places the text in a temporary
file, and calls XEmacs with the address of that temporary file.  Leo
then watches for changes in the temporary file.  When and if the
temporary file changes, Leo copies the contents to the body text of
the Leo node.

Below is the standard open_with.py plugin that came with Leo 4.1-rc3
The only modification I've made is to insert
@code
<<call XEmacs>>=
table = (
    ("X&Emacs", "Alt+Shift+O", ("os.system","/usr/bin/gnuclient -q ", None)),
    ("X&Emacs - noshow", "Ctrl+Shift+O", ("os.system","/mrc2/linux-bin/gnuclient-noshow ", None))
    )
@doc
as noted below.  A similar alteration should work for future
versions.

Note: this alteration is for XEmacs running under Linux, but a
similar command should work in the Windows environment.

I use the "gnuclient-noshow" selection to load the temporary open_with file in
the background.  It is a small bash shell script:
---
#!/bin/bash
gnuclient -eval "(find-file-noselect \"${1}\")"
---

To implement this, edit a copy of the open_with.py file that comes
with your version of Leo.  Move the original copy to a safe place,
and put your edited copy in the Leo plugins directory.  Check to see
it is included in "pluginsManager.txt" in that directory.

This is a module that creates an "Open With" menu item that opens
Leo outline nodes in the tree below the current Leo node in the
XEmacs editor.I frequently have a small tree of Leo nodes which
contain code that is usually edited in the same session.

NOTE: I use the "gnuclient-noshow" selection to load the temporary
open_with file in the background.Leo calls a command with the
temporary file name at the end of the command, but the gnuclient
command needs to receive it enclosed in quotes and parentheses.The
solution is a small intermediary bash shell script called
"gnuclient-noshow":

- - -
#!/bin/bash
gnuclient- eval "(find-file-noselect \"${1}\")"
- - -

I would rather have this operate in the background, but Leo ' s
openWith always operates on the current node, and openWith has much
good error checking that I want to use.So the fast solution was to
have OpenTreeInXEmacs visibly traverse the tree.

This is a small modification to Leo (via a Python plugin module) so
that Leo will open the temporary files with a name that can be
easily recognized in an XEmacs buffer listing.

On Linux, Leo opens files in the temporary files directory, all
prefixed with "LeoTemp_", which makes the names difficult to tell
apart when you have many different nodes loaded in XEmacs.

This code replaces the openWithTempFilePath method of the LeoFrame
class with code that opens temporary files in a subdirectory of the
temporary files directory, called "username_Leo", and omits the
"LeoTemp" prefix.

For example, I'm now editing this Leo node in XEmacs as
    "/tmp/michael_Leo/_Filename_modification__138976348.py"
In the XEmacs buffer list, the filename is shown as
    "_Filename_modification__138976348.py"
and all the Leo buffer names start with a leading underscore, so
they are grouped together.

For general use, this code should be considerably more robust about
creating the Leo subdirectory and signaling errors, but it is just a
quick hack that works for me on my machines.
@code

"""Replace Commands.openWithTempFilePath so Leo opens temporary
files with a filename that begins with the headline text, and

There is an editing mode for XEmacs called Multiple Major Modes,
which allows us to edit the temporary text conveniently: with all
the syntax highlighting, special keymaps, etc. available, even
though Leo nodes may contain both plain text and program code.

When the XEmacs cursor is in a section of plain text, all the plain
text facilities are available, and there is no syntax
highlighting. When the XEmacs cursor is in a section of code
(Python, XSL, whatever) XEmacs invokes the syntax highlighting,
special keymaps, etc. appropriate for that code.

indexterm:[Multiple Major Modes]
indexterm:[Multiple Major Modes,mmm-mode.el]
If you have XEmacs installed, and you have also installed the
Multiple Major Modes mmm-mode.el package, the following code will
customize mmm-mode for use while editing Leo temporary files.

NOTE: mmm-mode is already installed by default in most
distributions.

Installation: Load mmm-leo-config.el from your .init.el file, or
just load it manually to try it out.

I won't go through it all, but for example, when editing a temporary
Leo file that is in XEmacs Python mode, and/or has a ".py" suffix:

    - when your cursor is any text between the @doc and @code
      directives XEmacs will enter text-mode.  Otherwise (e.g. with
      the cursor after the @code directive), XEmacs will be in
      Python mode.
    - when your cursor is between text that says
      "xemacs -makefile-mode-on" and text that says
      "xemacs -makefile-mode-off", XEmacs will enter makefile-mode.
      (You key in those text markers to mark out the area you want
      as makefile-mode.  See the Leo2AsciiDoc.leo outline for examples,
      e.g the "Make File" section in the Leo2AsciiDoc Users Guide.)

      Otherwise, XEmacs will be in Python mode in that buffer.

Similarly, makefile-mode, xsl-mode and emacs-lisp-mode are added to
temporary Leo files that created with a ".txt" extension.

A future project may be to create a Leo module to use in the
Leo "openWith" function that examines each node for these mmm-mode
markers and creates the temporary file with the proper extension.

indexterm:[XEmacs, Indexing]
Indexing is tedious work, and it interferes with the readability of
the ascii text as well.  However, used sparingly, it helps the
reader.

When editing a Leo node (in an XEmacs buffer), this function copies
a highlighted word or phrase and inserts an AsciiDoc index code on a
new line immediately before the paragraph.  I try to keep markup out
of the way of the reader.  In this case, AsciiDoc requires that the
index code be part of the same block of text, and the first line of
the block is the least annoying place I can find.

For example, if I wanted to index the words "XEmacs buffer" above, I
would highlight them (usually by pressing M-@ a couple of times) and
then call this function (I have it bound to C-k C-h C-i).  At the
beginning of the paragraph, my text would say "\indexterm:[XEmacs
buffer]".

Leo derived files are sprinkled with comments, which Leo uses as
markers to be able to "untangle" files, i.e. import changes made to
a derived file back into the Leo outline.

Useful as they may be, the comments are an ugly distraction when
reading the source code.  One could have XEmacs flush them from the
file, but then the untangle feature is gone for that file.

This pair of XEmacs elisp functions moves them to the right, where
they aren't so distracting, and moves them back again if you should
want to untangle the file.
