Dependencies
============

This plugin uses docutils, http://docutils.sourceforge.net/, to render reStructuredText,
so installing docutils is highly recommended when using this plugin.

This plugin uses markdown, http://http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown, to render Markdown,
so installing markdown is highly recommended when using this plugin.
#@+node:ekr.20161014155647.3: *4* vr docstring: Commands
Commands
========

viewrendered.py creates the following (``Alt-X``) commands:

``viewrendered (abbreviated vr)``
    Opens a new rendering window.

    By default, the rendering pane renders body text as reStructuredText,
    with all Leo directives removed.
    However, if the body text starts with ``<`` (after removing directives),
    the body text is rendered as html.

    **Important**: The default rendering just described does not apply to nodes
    whose headlines begin with @image, @html, @movie, @networkx, @svg and @url.
    See the section called **Special Renderings** below.

    Rendering sets the process current directory (os.chdir()) to the path
    to the node being rendered, to allow relative paths to work in ``.. image::`` directives.

.. ``viewrendered-big``
..    as above, but zoomed in, useful for presentations
.. ``viewrendered-html``
..    displays the html source generated from reStructuredText, useful for
..    debugging

``vr-hide``
    Makes the rendering pane invisible, but does not destroy it.

``vr-lock`` and ``vr-unlock``
    Locks and unlocks the rendering pane.
    When unlocked (the initial state), the rendering pane renders the contents
    of the presently selected node.
    When locked, the rendering pane does not change when other nodes are selected.
    This is useful for playing movies in the rendering pane.

``vr-pause-play-movie``
    This command has effect only if the rendering pane is presently showing a movie.
    It pauses the movie if playing, or resumes the movie if paused.

``vr-show``
    Makes the rendering pane visible.

``vr-toggle``
    Shows the rendering pane if invisible, otherwise hides it.

``vr-update``
    Forces an update of the rendering pane.
    This is especially useful for @graphics-script nodes:
    such nodes are update automatically only when selected,
    not when the body text changes.
#@+node:ekr.20161014155647.4: *4* vr docstring: Rendering reStructuredText
Rendering reStructuredText
==========================

For example, both::

    Heading
    -------

    `This` is **really** a line of text.

and::

    <h1>Heading<h1>

    <tt>This</tt> is <b>really</b> a line of text.

will look something like:

    **Heading**

    `This` is **really** a line of text.

**Important**: reStructuredText errors and warnings will appear in red in the rendering pane.
#@+node:ekr.20161014155647.5: *4* vr docstring: Rendering markdown
Rendering markdown
==================

Please see the markdown syntax document at http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
for more information on markdown.

Unless ``@string view-rendered-default-kind`` is set to ``md``, markdown rendering must be
specified by putting it in a ``@md`` node.
#@+node:ekr.20161014155647.6: *4* vr docstring: Special Renderings
Special Renderings
===================

As stated above, the rendering pane renders body text as reStructuredText
by default, with all Leo directives removed. However, if the body text
starts with ``<`` (after removing directives), the body text is rendered as
html.

This plugin renders @md, @image, @html, @movie, @networkx and @svg nodes as follows:

**Note**: For @image, @movie and @svg nodes, either the headline or the first line of body text may
contain a filename.  If relative, the filename is resolved relative to Leo's load directory.

- ``@md`` renders the body text as markdown, as described above.

- ``@graphics-script`` executes the script in the body text in a context containing
  two predefined variables:

    - gs is the QGraphicsScene for the rendering pane.
    - gv is the QGraphicsView for the rendering pane.

  Using these variables, the script in the body text may create graphics to the rendering pane.

- ``@image`` renders the file as an image.


- ``@html`` renders the body text as html.


- ``@movie`` plays the file as a movie.  @movie also works for music files.

- ``@networkx`` is non-functional at present.  It is intended to
  render the body text as a networkx graph.
  See http://networkx.lanl.gov/

- ``@svg`` renders the file as a (possibly animated!) svg (Scalable Vector Image).
  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics
  **Note**: if the first character of the body text is ``<`` after removing Leo directives,
  the contents of body pane is taken to be an svg image.
#@+node:ekr.20161014155647.7: *4* vr docstring: Settings
Settings
========

- ``@color rendering-pane-background-color = white``
  The background color the rendering pane when rendering text.

- ``@bool view-rendered-auto-create = False``
  When True, show the rendering pane when Leo opens an outline.

- ``@bool view-rendered-auto-hide = False``
  When True, hide the rendering pane for text-only renderings.

- ``@string view-rendered-default-kind = rst``
  The default kind of rendering.  One of (big,rst,md,html)

- ``@string view-rendered-md-extensions = extra``
  A comma-delineated list of markdown extensions to use.
  Suitable extensions can be seen here:

Terry Brown created this initial version of this plugin, and the free_layout and NestedSplitter plugins used by viewrendered.

EKR generalized this plugin and added communication and coordination between the free_layout, NestedSplitter and viewrendered plugins.

Jacob Peck added markdown support.
