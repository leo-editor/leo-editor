Description: **Leo is**:

- An outliner. Everything in Leo is an outline.
- A Personal Information Manager.
- A browser with a memory.
- A powerful scripting environment.
- A tool for studying other people's code.
- A fully-featured IDE, with emacs-like commands.
- Extensible via a simple plugin architecture.
- A tool that plays well with  IPython, vim and xemacs.
- Written in 100% pure Python
- Compatible with Python 2.6 and above or Python 3.0 and above.

**Leo's unique features**:
    
- Always-present, persistent, outline structure.
- Leo's underlying data is a Directed Acyclic Graph.
- Clones create multiple views of an outline.
- A simple, powerful, outline-oriented Python API.
- Scripts and programs can be composed from outlines.
- Importers convert flat text into outlines.
- Scripts have full access to all of Leo's sources.
- Commands that act on outline structure.
  Example: the rst3 command converts outlines to reStructuredText.
- @test and @suite scripts create unit tests automatically.
- @button scripts apply scripts to outline data.
- Outline-oriented directives.

Simulating these features in vim or Emacs is possible, just as
it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...
